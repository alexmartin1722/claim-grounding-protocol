0,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018 FIFA World Cup', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The 2018 FIFA World Cup was the 21st FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for national football teams organized by FIFA.It took place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in late 2010.It was the eleventh time the championships had been held in Europe, the first time they were held in Eastern Europe, and the first time they were held across two continents (Europe and Asia).At an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion, it was the most expensive World Cup ever held until it was surpassed by the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nThe tournament phase involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through qualifying competitions, while the host nation Russia qualified automatically.Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the 2014 event, while Iceland and Panama each made their debut at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities.Germany, the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage for the first time since 1938.Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals.In the final, France played Croatia on 15 July at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.France won the match 4–2, claiming their second World Cup and becoming the fourth consecutive title won by a European team, after Italy in 2006, Spain in 2010, and Germany in 2014.\n\nCroatian player Luka Modrić was voted the tournament\'s best player, winning the Golden Ball.England\'s Harry Kane won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals during the tournament with six.Belgium\'s Thibaut Courtois won the Golden Glove, awarded to the goalkeeper with the best performance.It has been estimated that more than 3 million people attended games during the tournament.\n\nThe bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest.Initially, nine countries placed bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico later withdrew from the proceedings, and Indonesia\'s bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian government failed to submit a letter to support the bid.During the bidding process, the three remaining non-UEFA nations (Australia, Japan, and the United States) gradually withdrew from the 2018 bids, and thus all UEFA nations were ruled out of the 2022 bid.As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.\n\nThe 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting.The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third.England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.\n\nThe voting results were:\n\nThe choice of Russia as host was controversial.Issues included the high level of racism in Russian football, human rights abuses by Russian authorities, and discrimination against LGBT people in government (including gay propaganda laws) along with wider Russian society.Russia\'s involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine had also prompted calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the annexation of Crimea.In 2014, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that ""the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work"".\n\nRussia was criticised for alleged abuse of migrant labourers in the construction of World Cup venues, with Human Rights Watch reporting cases where workers were left unpaid, made to work in dangerously cold conditions, or suffering reprisals for raising concerns.A few pundits claimed it was slave labour.In May 2017, FIFA president Gianni Infantino admitted there had been human rights abuses of North Korean workers involved in the construction of Saint Petersburg\'s Zenit Arena.By June 2017, at least 17 workers had died on World Cup construction sites, according to Building and Wood Workers\' International.In August, a group of eight US senators called on FIFA to consider dismissing Russia as the World Cup host if an independent investigation verified allegations of North Koreans being subjected to forced labor.\n\nRacism and Neo-nazi symbols displayed in the past by some Russian football fans drew criticism, with documented incidents of racial chants, banners spewing hate-filled messages, and sometimes assaults on people from the Caucasus and Central Asia.In March 2015, FIFA\'s then Vice President Jeffrey Webb said that Russia posed a huge challenge from a racism standpoint, and that a World Cup could not be held there under the current conditions.On July, United Nations anti-discrimination official Yuri Boychenko said that Russian soccer authorities had failed to fully grasp what racism was and needed to do more to combat it.To address this as well as concerns of hooliganism in general, Russian intelligence services blacklisted over 400 fans from entering the stadiums by June 2018, with 32 other countries also sending officers to help local police screen attendees for valid ID cards.\n\nAllegations of corruption in the bidding processes and concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups led to threats from England\'s FA to boycott the tournament.They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and Sepp Blatter had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.FIFA appointed Michael J. Garcia, a US attorney, to investigate and produce a report on the corruption allegations.Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert.Eckert\'s summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert\'s absolving Russia from blame.Greg Dyke called for a re-examination of the affair and David Bernstein called for a boycott of the World Cup.Garcia criticised the summary as being ""materially incomplete"" with ""erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions"", and appealed to FIFA\'s Appeal Committee.The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned to protest of FIFA\'s conduct, citing a ""lack of leadership"" and lack of confidence in Eckert\'s independence.\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the FBI confirmed that federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.In an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA\'s Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that ""should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled"".Prince William of Wales and former British Prime Minister David Cameron attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in England was discussed.\n\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations—the 209 FIFA member associations except automatically qualified hosts Russia—applied to enter the qualifying process.Zimbabwe and Indonesia were later disqualified before playing their first matches, while Gibraltar and Kosovo, who joined FIFA on 13 May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.The first qualification game, between Timor-Leste and Mongolia, began in Dili on 12 March 2015 as part of the AFC\'s qualification, and the main qualifying draw took place at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, on 25 July 2015.\n\nOf the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2014.Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the smallest country in terms of population to reach the World Cup.Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments included: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, who last appeared in 1982; Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002.Poland, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Sweden have also returned after 12 years.It was the first time three Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four Arab nations (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.\n\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions Italy (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden and were the highest-ranked team to not qualify; and the Netherlands, who were three-time runners-up and had finished in third place in 2014, had qualified for the last three World Cups, and failed to qualify for their second major tournament in a row, missing out on the UEFA Euro 2016 as well.Four reigning continental champions: 2017 Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon; two-time Copa América champions and 2017 Confederations Cup runners-up Chile; 2016 OFC Nations Cup winners New Zealand; and 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup champions the United States (for the first time since 1986) also failed to qualify.The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Ghana and Ivory Coast, both of which had qualified for the three previous tournaments.The lowest-ranked team to qualify was the host nation, Russia.\n\nNote: Numbers in parentheses indicate positions in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the tournament.\n\nAFC (5) (36) (37) (61) (67) (57)\n\nCAF (5) (45) (41) (48) (27) (21)\n\nCONCACAF (3) (23) (15) (55)\n\nCONMEBOL (5) (5) (2) (16) (11) (14)\n\nOFC (0) None qualified\n\nUEFA (14) (3) (20) (joint 12) (joint 12) (7) (1) (22) (8) (4) (70) (hosts) (34) (10) (24) (6)\n\nThe draw was held on 1 December 2017 at 18:00 MSK at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow.The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, by selecting one team from each of the four ranked pots.\n\nFor the draw, the teams were allocated to four pots based entirely on the FIFA World Rankings of October 2017.Pot one contained the hosts Russia (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams.Pot two contained the next best eight teams, and so on for pots three and four.This was different from previous draws, when only pot one was based on FIFA rankings while the remaining pots were based on geographical considerations.However, teams from the same confederation still were not drawn against each other for the group stage, except that two UEFA teams could be in each group.The pots for the draw are shown below.\n\nInitially, each team had to name a preliminary squad of 30 players, but in February 2018 this was increased to 35.From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 23 players (three of whom had to be goalkeepers) by 4 June.Players in the final squad could be replaced for serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team\'s first match.These replacements did not need to have been named in the preliminary squad.\n\nFor players named in the 35-player preliminary squad, there was a mandatory rest period between 21 and 27 May 2018, except for those involved in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final played on 26 May.\n\nOn 29 March 2018, FIFA released the list of 36 referees and 63 assistant referees selected to oversee matches.On 30 April 2018, FIFA released the list of 13 video assistant referees, who acted solely in this capacity in the tournament.\n\nReferee Fahad Al-Mirdasi of Saudi Arabia was removed on 30 May 2018 over a match-fixing attempt, along with his two assistant referees, compatriots Mohammed Al-Abakry and Abdulah Al-Shalwai.A new referee was not appointed, but two assistant referees, Hasan Al Mahri of the United Arab Emirates and Hiroshi Yamauchi of Japan, were added to the list.Assistant referee Marwa Range of Kenya also withdrew after the BBC released an investigation conducted by a Ghanaian journalist which implicated him in a bribery scandal.\n\nShortly after the International Football Association Board\'s decision to incorporate video assistant referees (VARs) into the Laws of the game (LOTG) on 16 March 2018, the FIFA Council took the much-anticipated step of approving the use of VAR for the first time in a FIFA World Cup tournament.\n\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees.Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums\' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.\n\nVAR had a significant impact on several games.On 15 June 2018, Diego Costa\'s first goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision; the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16 June and resulted in a goal by Antoine Griezmann.A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, a phenomenon partially attributed to VAR.Overall, the new technology was both praised and criticised by commentators.FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.\n\nRussia proposed the following host cities: Kaliningrad, Kazan, Krasnodar, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg, Samara, Saransk, Sochi, Volgograd, Yaroslavl, and Yekaterinburg.Each chosen city was located in European Russia (except Yekaterinburg, which is located in Asia but lies very close to the Europe-Asia border) in order to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country.The bid evaluation report stated: ""The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA\'s minimum requirement.Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.""\n\nIn October 2011, Russia reduced the number of stadiums from 16 to 14.Construction of the proposed Podolsk stadium in the Moscow Oblast was cancelled by the regional government.Also, in the capital, Otkritie Arena was competing with Dynamo Stadium over which would be constructed first.\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29 September 2012.The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list.Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8 billion was spent on hosting the tournament.\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.He also said, ""We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums in South Africa, where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums"".\n\nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA\'s inspection committee and its head, Chris Unger, visited St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues.They were satisfied with the progress.On 8 October 2015, FIFA and the local organising committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums to be used during the tournament.Of the twelve venues, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium—the two largest stadiums in Russia—were used most; both hosted seven matches.Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara each hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Otkritie Stadium in Moscow and the Rostov Stadium hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each.Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk each hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\n\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Between 2010 (when Russia were announced as hosts) and 2018, nine of the twelve stadiums were built (some in place of older, outdated venues) and the other three were renovated for the tournament.Kaliningrad: Kaliningrad Stadium (new).The first piles were driven into the ground in September 2015.On 11 April 2018 it hosted its first match.Kazan: Kazan Arena (new).The stadium was built for the 2013 Summer Universiade.It has since hosted the 2015 World Aquatics

2018.Saransk: Mordovia Arena (new).The stadium in Saransk was scheduled to be commissioned in 2012 in time for the opening of the all-Russian Spartakiad, but the plan was revised.The opening was rescheduled to 2017.The arena hosted its first match on 21 April 2018.Sochi: Fisht Stadium (slightly renovated).This stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics.Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup.Volgograd: Volgograd Arena (new).The main Volgograd arena was built on the demolished Central Stadium site, at the foot of the Mamayev Kurgan memorial complex.It was commissioned on 3 April 2018.Yekaterinburg: Ekaterinburg Arena (heavily renovated).The Central Stadium of Yekaterinburg had been renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Its stands have a capacity of 35,000 spectators.The renovation project was completed in December 2017.\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament.On 9 February 2018, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team.\n\nArgentina: Bronnitsy, Moscow Oblast Australia: Kazan,

over $14.2 billion , the 2018 FIFA event was the most expensive World Cup in history, surpassing the $11.6 billion cost of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.\n\nThe Russian government had originally earmarked a budget of around $20 billion, which was later slashed to $10 billion, for World Cup preparations.Half was spent on transportation infrastructure.As part of the program to prepare for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a federal sub-program—""Construction and Renovation of Transport Infrastructure""—was implemented with a total budget of ₽352.5 billion (rubles), with ₽170.3 billion coming from the federal budget, ₽35.1 billion from regional budgets, and ₽147.1 billion from investors.The biggest item of federal spending was the aviation infrastructure costing ₽117.8 billion.Construction of new hotels was a crucial area of infrastructure development in World Cup host cities.Costs continued to mount as preparations were underway.\n\nPlatov International Airport in Rostov-on-Don was upgraded with automated air traffic control systems.Modern surveillance, navigation, communication, control, and meteorological support systems were also installed.Koltsovo Airport in Yekaterinburg was upgraded with radio-engineering tools for flight operation and received a second runway.Saransk Airport received a new navigation system; two new hotels were constructed in the city—the Mercure Saransk Centre (Accor Hotels) and Four Points by Sheraton Saransk as well as few other smaller accommodation facilities.In Samara, new tram lines were laid.Khrabrovo Airport in Kaliningrad was upgraded with radio navigation and weather equipment.Renovation and upgraded radio-engineering tools for flight operations was completed in the Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Volgograd, Samara, Yekaterinburg, Kazan and Sochi airports.On 27 March, the Russian Ministry of Construction Industry, Housing and Utilities Sector of reported that all communications within its area of responsibility had been commissioned.The last facility commissioned was a waste treatment station in Volgograd.In Yekaterinburg, where four matches were hosted, hosting costs increased to over ₽7.4 billion, exceeding the ₽5.6 billion rubles originally allocated from the state and regional budget.\n\nVolunteer applications to the 2018 Russia Local Organising Committee opened on 1 June 2016.The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Volunteer Program received about 177,000 applications, and engaged a total of 35,000 volunteers.They received training at 15 Volunteer Centres of the local organising committee based in 15 universities, and in volunteer centres in the host cities.Preference, especially in key areas, was given to those with knowledge of a foreign language and volunteering experience, but not necessarily to Russian nationals.\n\nFree public transport services were offered for ticketholders during the World Cup, including additional trains linking host cities, as well as services such as bus services within them.\n\nThe full schedule was announced by FIFA on 24 July 2015 without kick-off times, which were confirmed later.On 1 December 2017, following the final draw, FIFA adjusted six kick-off times.\n\nRussia was placed in position A1 in the group stage and played in the opening match at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on 14 June against Saudi Arabia, the two lowest-ranked teams of the tournament at the time of the final draw.The Luzhniki Stadium also hosted the second semi-final on 11 July and the final on 15 July.The Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg hosted the first semi-final on 10 July and the third place play-off on 14 July.\n\nThe opening ceremony took place on Thursday, 14 June 2018, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, preceding the opening match of the tournament between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia.\n\nAt the start of the ceremony, Russian president Vladimir Putin gave a speech, welcoming the countries of the world to Russia and calling football a uniting force.Brazilian World Cup-winning striker Ronaldo entered the stadium with a child in a Russia jersey.Pop singer Robbie Williams then sang two of his songs solo before he and Russian soprano Aida Garifullina performed a duet.Dancers dressed in the flags of the 32 competing teams appeared carrying a sign with the name of each nation.At the end of the ceremony Ronaldo reappeared with the official match ball which had returned from the International Space Station in early June.\n\nYoung participants of the international children\'s social programme Football for Friendship from 211 countries and regions took part in the opening ceremony of the FIFA World Cup at the Luzhniki stadium.\n\nCompeting countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H).Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage.Ten European teams and four South American teams progressed to the knockout stage, together with Japan and Mexico.\n\nFor the first time since 1938, Germany, the reigning champions, were eliminated in the first round.This was the third consecutive tournament in which the holders were eliminated in the first round, after Italy in 2010 and Spain in 2014.No African team progressed to the second round for the first time since 1982.The fair play criteria came into use for the first time when Japan qualified over Senegal because the team had received fewer yellow cards.Only one match, France versus Denmark, was goalless.Until then there were a record 36 straight games in which at least one goal was scored.All times listed below are local time.\n\nIn the knockout stages, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winners.If a match went into extra time, each team was allowed to make a fourth substitution, the first time this had been allowed in a FIFA World Cup tournament.Below is the bracket for the knockout round of the tournament, teams in bold denote match winners.\n\nIn total, only four players were sent off in the entire tournament, the fewest since 1978.International Football Association Board technical director David Elleray stated a belief that this was due to the introduction of VAR, since players would know that they would not be able to get away with anything under the new system.\n\nA player is automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences: Receiving a red card (red card suspensions may be extended for serious offences)Receiving two yellow cards in two matches; yellow cards expire after the completion of the quarter-finals (yellow card suspensions are not carried forward to any other future international matches)\n\nThe following suspensions were served during the tournament:\n\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament.The Golden Boot (top scorer), Golden Ball (best overall player) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper) awards were all sponsored by Adidas.\n\nThe users of FIFA.com elected their Fan Dream Team.\n\nAdditionally, FIFA.com shortlisted 18 goals for users to vote on as the tournament\'s best.The poll closed on 23 July.The award was sponsored by Hyundai.\n\nFIFA published an All-Star Team, this year called the Fantasy Team, based on player performances evaluated through statistical data.\n\nPrize money amounts were announced in October 2017.\n\nThe tournament logo was unveiled on 28 October 2014 by cosmonauts at the International Space Station and then projected onto Moscow\'s Bolshoi Theatre during an evening television programme.Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said the logo was inspired by ""Russia\'s rich artistic tradition and its history of bold achievement and innovation"", and FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that it reflected the ""heart and soul"" of the country.For branding, Portuguese design agency Brandia Central created materials in 2014, with a typeface called Dusha – – designed by Brandia Central and edited by Adotbelow of the DSType Foundry in Portugal.\n\nThe first phase of ticket sales started on 14 September 2017, 12:00 Moscow Time, and lasted until 12 October 2017.\n\nThe general visa policy of Russia did not apply to participants and spectators, who were able to visit Russia without a visa right before and during the competition regardless of their citizenship.Spectators were nonetheless required to register for a ""Fan-ID"", a special photo identification pass.A Fan-ID was required to enter the country visa-free, while a ticket, Fan-ID and a valid passport were required to enter stadiums for matches.Fan-IDs also granted World Cup attendees free access to public transport services, including buses, and train service between host cities.Fan-ID was administered by the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, which could revoke this accreditation at any time to ""ensure the defence capability or security of the state or public order"".\n\nOn 29 May 2018, Electronic Arts released a free update to their video game FIFA 18 that added content related to the 2018 FIFA World Cup.The expansion included a World Cup tournament mode with all teams and stadiums from the event, official television presentation elements, and World Cup-related content for the Ultimate Team mode.\n\nPanini continued their partnership with FIFA by producing stickers for their World Cup sticker album.Panini also developed an app for the 2018 World Cup where fans could collect and swap virtual stickers, with 5 million fans gathering digital stickers for the tournament.\n\nThe tournament\'s official mascot was unveiled on 21 October 2016, and selected through a design competition among university students.A public vote was used to select the mascot from three finalists—a cat, a tiger, and a wolf.The winner, with 53% or approximately 1 million votes, was Zabivaka—an anthropomorphic wolf dressed in the colours of the Russian national team.Zabivaka\'s name is a portmanteau of the Russian words забияка (""hothead"") and забивать (""to score""), and his official backstory states that he is an aspiring football player who is ""charming, confident and social"".\n\nThe official match ball, the ""Telstar 18"", was unveiled on 9 November 2017.It was based on the name and design of the first Adidas World Cup ball from 1970.A special red-coloured variation, ""Telstar Mechta"", was used for the knockout stage of the tournament.The word mechta (Russian: мечта) means ""dream"" or ""ambition"".\n\nGoalkeepers noted that the ball was slippery and prone to having unpredictable trajectory.In addition, two Telstar 18 balls popped in the midst of a first-round match between France and Australia, leading to further discussions over the ball\'s performance.\n\nThe official song of the tournament was ""Live It Up"", with vocals by Will Smith, Nicky Jam and Era Istrefi, released on 25 May 2018.Its music video was released on 8 June 2018.\n\nThirty-three footballers who were alleged to be part of the Russian steroid programme are listed in the McLaren Report.On 22 December 2017, it was reported that FIFA had fired a doctor who had been investigating doping in Russian football.On 22 May 2018, FIFA stated that the investigations concerning all Russian players named for the provisional squad of the FIFA World Cup in Russia had been completed, with the result that insufficient evidence was found to support anti-doping rule violations.FIFA\'s medical committee also decided that Russian personnel would not be involved in performing drug testing procedures at the tournament, an action taken to reassure teams that samples would not be tampered with.\n\nRussia relaxed its visa rules during the World Cup, allowing Fan ID holders to enter and exit Russia without a visa through 31 December 2018.Traffickers exploited this system to bring foreign sex trafficking victims into the country, especially from Nigeria.Reuters had raised concerns about the victims\' conditions, who had allegedly been forced into prostitution, with some of them enduring violent abuse.Russian authorities were accused of doing little to fix to the issue, allegedly because many locals blamed the victims for falling into prostitution.\n\nIn response to the March 2018 poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, British prime minister Theresa May announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans.Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that the West are trying to ""take the World Cup out of Russia"".The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced Boris Johnson\'s statements that compared the event to the 1936 Olympics held in Nazi Germany as ""poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness"" and ""unacceptable and unworthy"" parallel towards Russia, a ""nation that lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism"".\n\nAt the close of the World Cup, Russia was widely praised for its success in hosting the tournament, with Steve Rosenberg of the BBC deeming it ""a resounding public relations success"" for Putin, adding: ""The stunning new stadiums, free train travel to venues and the absence of crowd violence has impressed visiting supporters.Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country\'s authoritarian image.All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised.""\n\nDespite the British Foreign Office and MPs repeatedly warning English football fans travelling to Russia of ""racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility"", fans who did travel said they received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino stated: ""Everyone discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, that is keen to show the world that everything that has been said before might not be true.A lot of preconceived ideas have been changed because people have seen the true nature of Russia.""Infantino has proclaimed Russia 2018 to be ""the best World Cup ever.""98 percent of the stadiums were sold out, there were 3 billion viewers on TV around the world and 7 million fans visited the fan fests.It was the most viewed World Cup to date, and the third most viewed television broadcast, surpassing the Beijing Olympics in 2008.\n\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters.After having tested the technology at limited matches of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the 2014 FIFA World Cup (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of Rio de Janeiro), the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in 4K ultra high definition.Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut of each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being converted up from 1080p high definition sources with limited degradation in quality.These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder UA:PBC stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup due to existing tensions with Russia amidst the Russo-Ukrainian War.This came in the wake of growing boycott of the tournament by the Football Federation of Ukraine and sports minister Ihor Zhdanov.Additionally, the FFU refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing diplomatic crisis in Qatar, which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar—the home country of FIFA\'s Middle East and Africa rightsholder beIN Sports—in June 2017, over its alleged state support of terrorist groups.On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from Du and Etisalat, but with service to the latter restored later that day.Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as ""beoutQ"".While FIFA attempted to negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final indirectly, they were unable to do so.On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had ""engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.""\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men\'s World Cup whose English rights were held by Fox Sports, and Spanish rights held by Telemundo.The elimination of the United States in the qualifiers led to concerns that U.S. interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that ""casual"" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5 million in 2014, and determined how much Fox paid for the rights.During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among Hispanic and Latino Americans.Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of tournament coverage.Viewership was down overall compared to 2014; match scheduling and time zones were not as favourable to viewers in the Americas as they were in 2014.Many games aired in the morning hours, although Telemundo\'s broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday daytime program in the network\'s history.\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, Korean Central Television acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea.Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time.In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to strained relations and campaigns against the country.\n\nA combined 3.572 billion unique viewers (live global 1-minute reach) – more than half of the global population aged four and over – tuned in to world football\'s ultimate competition, according to audience data for official broadcast coverage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe average global live audience for every game of the tournament was 191 million viewers (for a cumulative live audience of 12.224 billion viewers), a 2.1% increase over the 2014 tournament average of 187 million viewers, including that average audience in the early stages (group stage and round of 16) were bigger than in 2014.However, in 2018, the audience was 15 percent smaller for the semi-finals, 17 percent for the third place play-off, and 5.1 percent for the final, which was watched by 517 million people on average (only in-home TV viewers), compared to 545 million in 2014.Presumably, the reason for that is the smaller countries involved in the top four games compared to those in 2014, and only one global region (Europe) being represented in 2018 (compared to South America and Europe in 2014).However the live global 1-minute reach of the final was 1.12 billion people (884.37 in-home TV viewers and 231.82 million out-of-home and (or) digital-only viewers).\n\nFIFA World Cup FIFA World Cup hosts 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup 2019 FIFA Women\'s World Cup\n', 'Claim_Context': ""Croatian player Luka Modrić

1,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018 FIFA World Cup', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The 2018 FIFA World Cup was the 21st FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for national football teams organized by FIFA.It took place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in late 2010.It was the eleventh time the championships had been held in Europe, the first time they were held in Eastern Europe, and the first time they were held across two continents (Europe and Asia).At an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion, it was the most expensive World Cup ever held until it was surpassed by the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nThe tournament phase involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through qualifying competitions, while the host nation Russia qualified automatically.Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the 2014 event, while Iceland and Panama each made their debut at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities.Germany, the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage for the first time since 1938.Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals.In the final, France played Croatia on 15 July at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.France won the match 4–2, claiming their second World Cup and becoming the fourth consecutive title won by a European team, after Italy in 2006, Spain in 2010, and Germany in 2014.\n\nCroatian player Luka Modrić was voted the tournament\'s best player, winning the Golden Ball.England\'s Harry Kane won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals during the tournament with six.Belgium\'s Thibaut Courtois won the Golden Glove, awarded to the goalkeeper with the best performance.It has been estimated that more than 3 million people attended games during the tournament.\n\nThe bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest.Initially, nine countries placed bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico later withdrew from the proceedings, and Indonesia\'s bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian government failed to submit a letter to support the bid.During the bidding process, the three remaining non-UEFA nations (Australia, Japan, and the United States) gradually withdrew from the 2018 bids, and thus all UEFA nations were ruled out of the 2022 bid.As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.\n\nThe 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting.The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third.England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.\n\nThe voting results were:\n\nThe choice of Russia as host was controversial.Issues included the high level of racism in Russian football, human rights abuses by Russian authorities, and discrimination against LGBT people in government (including gay propaganda laws) along with wider Russian society.Russia\'s involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine had also prompted calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the annexation of Crimea.In 2014, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that ""the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work"".\n\nRussia was criticised for alleged abuse of migrant labourers in the construction of World Cup venues, with Human Rights Watch reporting cases where workers were left unpaid, made to work in dangerously cold conditions, or suffering reprisals for raising concerns.A few pundits claimed it was slave labour.In May 2017, FIFA president Gianni Infantino admitted there had been human rights abuses of North Korean workers involved in the construction of Saint Petersburg\'s Zenit Arena.By June 2017, at least 17 workers had died on World Cup construction sites, according to Building and Wood Workers\' International.In August, a group of eight US senators called on FIFA to consider dismissing Russia as the World Cup host if an independent investigation verified allegations of North Koreans being subjected to forced labor.\n\nRacism and Neo-nazi symbols displayed in the past by some Russian football fans drew criticism, with documented incidents of racial chants, banners spewing hate-filled messages, and sometimes assaults on people from the Caucasus and Central Asia.In March 2015, FIFA\'s then Vice President Jeffrey Webb said that Russia posed a huge challenge from a racism standpoint, and that a World Cup could not be held there under the current conditions.On July, United Nations anti-discrimination official Yuri Boychenko said that Russian soccer authorities had failed to fully grasp what racism was and needed to do more to combat it.To address this as well as concerns of hooliganism in general, Russian intelligence services blacklisted over 400 fans from entering the stadiums by June 2018, with 32 other countries also sending officers to help local police screen attendees for valid ID cards.\n\nAllegations of corruption in the bidding processes and concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups led to threats from England\'s FA to boycott the tournament.They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and Sepp Blatter had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.FIFA appointed Michael J. Garcia, a US attorney, to investigate and produce a report on the corruption allegations.Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert.Eckert\'s summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert\'s absolving Russia from blame.Greg Dyke called for a re-examination of the affair and David Bernstein called for a boycott of the World Cup.Garcia criticised the summary as being ""materially incomplete"" with ""erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions"", and appealed to FIFA\'s Appeal Committee.The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned to protest of FIFA\'s conduct, citing a ""lack of leadership"" and lack of confidence in Eckert\'s independence.\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the FBI confirmed that federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.In an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA\'s Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that ""should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled"".Prince William of Wales and former British Prime Minister David Cameron attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in England was discussed.\n\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations—the 209 FIFA member associations except automatically qualified hosts Russia—applied to enter the qualifying process.Zimbabwe and Indonesia were later disqualified before playing their first matches, while Gibraltar and Kosovo, who joined FIFA on 13 May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.The first qualification game, between Timor-Leste and Mongolia, began in Dili on 12 March 2015 as part of the AFC\'s qualification, and the main qualifying draw took place at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, on 25 July 2015.\n\nOf the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2014.Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the smallest country in terms of population to reach the World Cup.Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments included: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, who last appeared in 1982; Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002.Poland, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Sweden have also returned after 12 years.It was the first time three Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four Arab nations (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.\n\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions Italy (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden and were the highest-ranked team to not qualify; and the Netherlands, who were three-time runners-up and had finished in third place in 2014, had qualified for the last three World Cups, and failed to qualify for their second major tournament in a row, missing out on the UEFA Euro 2016 as well.Four reigning continental champions: 2017 Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon; two-time Copa América champions and 2017 Confederations Cup runners-up Chile; 2016 OFC Nations Cup winners New Zealand; and 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup champions the United States (for the first time since 1986) also failed to qualify.The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Ghana and Ivory Coast, both of which had qualified for the three previous tournaments.The lowest-ranked team to qualify was the host nation, Russia.\n\nNote: Numbers in parentheses indicate positions in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the tournament.\n\nAFC (5) (36) (37) (61) (67) (57)\n\nCAF (5) (45) (41) (48) (27) (21)\n\nCONCACAF (3) (23) (15)

December 2017 at 18:00 MSK at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow.The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, by selecting one team from each of the four ranked pots.\n\nFor the draw, the teams were allocated to four pots based entirely on the FIFA World Rankings of October 2017.Pot one contained the hosts Russia (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams.Pot two contained the next best eight teams, and so on for pots three and four.This was different from previous draws, when only pot one was based on FIFA rankings while the remaining pots were based on geographical considerations.However, teams from the same confederation still were not drawn against each other for the group stage, except that two UEFA teams could be in each group.The pots for the draw are shown below.\n\nInitially, each team had to name a preliminary squad of 30 players, but in February 2018 this was increased to 35.From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 23 players (three of whom had to be goalkeepers) by 4 June.Players in the final squad could be replaced for serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team\'s first match.These replacements did not need to have been named in the preliminary squad.\n\nFor players named in the 35-player preliminary squad, there was a mandatory rest period between 21 and 27 May 2018, except for those involved in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final played on 26 May.\n\nOn 29 March 2018, FIFA released the list of 36 referees and 63 assistant referees selected to oversee matches.On 30 April 2018, FIFA released the list of 13 video assistant referees, who acted solely in this capacity in the tournament.\n\nReferee Fahad Al-Mirdasi of Saudi Arabia was removed on 30 May 2018 over a match-fixing attempt, along with his two assistant referees, compatriots Mohammed Al-Abakry and Abdulah Al-Shalwai.A new referee was not appointed, but two assistant referees, Hasan Al Mahri of the United Arab Emirates and Hiroshi Yamauchi of Japan, were added to the list.Assistant referee Marwa Range of Kenya also withdrew after the BBC released an investigation conducted by a Ghanaian journalist which implicated him in a bribery scandal.\n\nShortly after the International Football Association Board\'s decision to incorporate video assistant referees (VARs) into the Laws of the game (LOTG) on 16 March 2018, the FIFA Council took the much-anticipated step of approving the use of VAR for the first time in a FIFA World Cup tournament.\n\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees.Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums\' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.\n\nVAR had a significant impact on several games.On 15 June 2018, Diego Costa\'s first goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision; the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16 June and resulted in a goal by Antoine Griezmann.A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, a phenomenon partially attributed to VAR.Overall, the new technology was both praised and criticised by commentators.FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.\n\nRussia proposed the following host cities: Kaliningrad, Kazan, Krasnodar, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg, Samara, Saransk, Sochi, Volgograd, Yaroslavl, and Yekaterinburg.Each chosen city was located in European Russia (except Yekaterinburg, which is located in Asia but lies very close to the Europe-Asia border) in order to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country.The bid evaluation report stated: ""The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA\'s minimum requirement.Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.""\n\nIn October 2011, Russia reduced the number of stadiums from 16 to 14.Construction of the proposed Podolsk stadium in the Moscow Oblast was cancelled by the regional government.Also, in the capital, Otkritie Arena was competing with Dynamo Stadium over which would be constructed first.\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29 September 2012.The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list.Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8 billion was spent on hosting the tournament.\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.He also said, ""We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums in South Africa, where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums"".\n\nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA\'s inspection committee and its head, Chris Unger, visited St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues.They were satisfied with the progress.On 8 October 2015, FIFA and the local organising committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums to be used during the tournament.Of the twelve venues, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium—the two largest stadiums in Russia—were used most; both hosted seven matches.Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara each hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Otkritie Stadium in Moscow and the Rostov Stadium hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each.Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk each hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\n\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Between 2010 (when Russia were announced as hosts) and 2018, nine of the twelve stadiums were built (some in place of older, outdated venues) and the other three were renovated for the tournament.Kaliningrad: Kaliningrad Stadium (new).The first piles were driven into the ground in September 2015.On 11 April 2018 it hosted its first match.Kazan: Kazan Arena (new).The stadium was built for the 2013 Summer Universiade.It has since hosted the 2015 World Aquatics Championships and the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup.It serves as a home arena for FC Rubin Kazan.Moscow: Luzhniki Stadium (heavily renovated).The largest stadium in the country, it was closed for renovation in 2013.It was commissioned in November 2017.Moscow: Spartak Stadium (new).This stadium is the home arena to its namesake FC Spartak Moscow.In accordance with FIFA requirements, during the 2018 World Cup, it was called Spartak Stadium instead of its usual name Otkritie Arena.It hosted its first match on 5 September 2014.Nizhny Novgorod: Nizhny Novgorod Stadium (new).Construction of this stadium commenced in 2015 and was completed in December 2017.Rostov-on-Don: Rostov Arena (new).The stadium is located on the left bank of the Don.Construction was completed on 22 December 2017.Saint Petersburg: Saint Petersburg Stadium (new).Construction commenced in 2007 after the site, formerly occupied by Kirov Stadium, was cleared.The project was officially completed on 29 December 2016.It has hosted 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup games and served as a venue for UEFA Euro 2020.Samara: Samara Arena (new).Construction officially started on 21 July 2014 and was completed on 21 April 2018.Saransk: Mordovia Arena (new).The stadium in Saransk was scheduled to be commissioned in 2012 in time for the opening of the all-Russian Spartakiad, but the plan was revised.The opening was rescheduled to 2017.The arena hosted its first match on 21 April 2018.Sochi: Fisht Stadium (slightly renovated).This stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics.Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup.Volgograd: Volgograd Arena (new).The main Volgograd arena was built on the demolished Central Stadium site, at the foot of the Mamayev Kurgan memorial complex.It was commissioned on 3 April 2018.Yekaterinburg: Ekaterinburg Arena (heavily renovated).The Central Stadium of Yekaterinburg had been renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Its stands have a capacity of 35,000 spectators.The renovation project was completed in December 2017.\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament.On 9 February 2018, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team.\n\nArgentina: Bronnitsy, Moscow Oblast Australia: Kazan,

over $14.2 billion , the 2018 FIFA event was the most expensive World Cup in history, surpassing the $11.6 billion cost of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.\n\nThe Russian government had originally earmarked a budget of around $20 billion, which was later slashed to $10 billion, for World Cup preparations.Half was spent on transportation infrastructure.As part of the program to prepare for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a federal sub-program—""Construction and Renovation of Transport Infrastructure""—was implemented with a total budget of ₽352.5 billion (rubles), with ₽170.3 billion coming from the federal budget, ₽35.1 billion from regional budgets, and ₽147.1 billion from investors.The biggest item of federal spending was the aviation infrastructure costing ₽117.8 billion.Construction of new hotels was a crucial area of infrastructure development in World Cup host cities.Costs continued to mount as preparations were underway.\n\nPlatov International Airport in Rostov-on-Don was upgraded with automated air traffic control systems.Modern surveillance, navigation, communication, control, and meteorological support systems were also installed.Koltsovo Airport in Yekaterinburg was upgraded with radio-engineering tools for flight operation and received a second runway.Saransk Airport received a new navigation system; two new hotels were constructed in the city—the Mercure Saransk Centre (Accor Hotels) and Four Points by Sheraton Saransk as well as few other smaller accommodation facilities.In Samara, new tram lines were laid.Khrabrovo Airport in Kaliningrad was upgraded with radio navigation and weather equipment.Renovation and upgraded radio-engineering tools for flight operations was completed in the Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Volgograd, Samara, Yekaterinburg, Kazan and Sochi airports.On 27 March, the Russian Ministry of Construction Industry, Housing and Utilities Sector of reported that all communications within its area of responsibility had been commissioned.The last facility commissioned was a waste treatment station in Volgograd.In Yekaterinburg, where four matches were hosted, hosting costs increased to over ₽7.4 billion, exceeding the ₽5.6 billion rubles originally allocated from the state and regional budget.\n\nVolunteer applications to the 2018 Russia Local Organising Committee opened on 1 June 2016.The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Volunteer Program received about 177,000 applications, and engaged a total of 35,000 volunteers.They received training at 15 Volunteer Centres of the local organising committee based in 15 universities, and in volunteer centres in the host cities.Preference, especially in key areas, was given to those with knowledge of a foreign language and volunteering experience, but not necessarily to Russian nationals.\n\nFree public transport services were offered for ticketholders during the World Cup, including additional trains linking host cities, as well as services such as bus services within them.\n\nThe full schedule was announced by FIFA on 24 July 2015 without kick-off times, which were confirmed later.On 1 December 2017, following the final draw, FIFA adjusted six kick-off times.\n\nRussia was placed in position A1 in the group stage and played in the opening match at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on 14 June against Saudi Arabia, the two lowest-ranked teams of the tournament at the time of the final draw.The Luzhniki Stadium also hosted the second semi-final on 11 July and the final on 15 July.The Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg hosted the first semi-final on 10 July and the third place play-off on 14 July.\n\nThe opening ceremony took place on Thursday, 14 June 2018, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, preceding the opening match of the tournament between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia.\n\nAt the start of the ceremony, Russian president Vladimir Putin gave a speech, welcoming the countries of the world to Russia and calling football a uniting force.Brazilian World Cup-winning striker Ronaldo entered the stadium with a child in a Russia jersey.Pop singer Robbie Williams then sang two of his songs solo before he and Russian soprano Aida Garifullina performed a duet.Dancers dressed in the flags of the 32 competing teams appeared carrying a sign with the name of each nation.At the end of the ceremony Ronaldo reappeared with the official match ball which had returned from the International Space Station in early June.\n\nYoung participants of the international children\'s social programme Football for Friendship from 211 countries and regions took part in the opening ceremony of the FIFA World Cup at the Luzhniki stadium.\n\nCompeting countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H).Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage.Ten European teams and four South American teams progressed to the knockout stage, together with Japan and Mexico.\n\nFor the first time since 1938, Germany, the reigning champions, were eliminated in the first round.This was the third consecutive tournament in which the holders were eliminated in the first round, after Italy in 2010 and Spain in 2014.No African team progressed to the second round for the first time since 1982.The fair play criteria came into use for the first time when Japan qualified over Senegal because the team had received fewer yellow cards.Only one match, France versus Denmark, was goalless.Until then there were a record 36 straight games in which at least one goal was scored.All times listed below are local time.\n\nIn the knockout stages, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winners.If a match went into extra time, each team was allowed to make a fourth substitution, the first time this had been allowed in a FIFA World Cup tournament.Below is the bracket for the knockout round of the tournament, teams in bold denote match winners.\n\nIn total, only four players were sent off in the entire tournament, the fewest since 1978.International Football Association Board technical director David Elleray stated a belief that this was due to the introduction of VAR, since players would know that they would not be able to get away with anything under the new system.\n\nA player is automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences: Receiving a red card (red card suspensions may be extended for serious offences)Receiving two yellow cards in two matches; yellow cards expire after the completion of the quarter-finals (yellow card suspensions are not carried forward to any other future international matches)\n\nThe following suspensions were served during the tournament:\n\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament.The Golden Boot (top scorer), Golden Ball (best overall player) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper) awards were all sponsored by Adidas.\n\nThe users of FIFA.com elected their Fan Dream Team.\n\nAdditionally, FIFA.com shortlisted 18 goals for users to vote on as the tournament\'s best.The poll closed on 23 July.The award was sponsored by Hyundai.\n\nFIFA published an All-Star Team, this year called the Fantasy Team, based on player performances evaluated through statistical data.\n\nPrize money amounts were announced in October 2017.\n\nThe tournament logo was unveiled on 28 October 2014 by cosmonauts at the International Space Station and then projected onto Moscow\'s Bolshoi Theatre during an evening television programme.Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said the logo was inspired by ""Russia\'s rich artistic tradition and its history of bold achievement and innovation"", and FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that it reflected the ""heart and soul"" of the country.For branding, Portuguese design agency Brandia Central created materials in 2014, with a typeface called Dusha – – designed by Brandia Central and edited by Adotbelow of the DSType Foundry in Portugal.\n\nThe first phase of ticket sales started on 14 September 2017, 12:00 Moscow Time, and lasted until 12 October 2017.\n\nThe general visa policy of Russia did not apply to participants and spectators, who were able to visit Russia without a visa right before and during the competition regardless of their citizenship.Spectators were nonetheless required to register for a ""Fan-ID"", a special photo identification pass.A Fan-ID was required to enter the country visa-free, while a ticket, Fan-ID and a valid passport were required to enter stadiums for matches.Fan-IDs also granted World Cup attendees free access to public transport services, including buses, and train service between host cities.Fan-ID was administered by the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, which could revoke this accreditation at any time to ""ensure the defence capability or security of the state or public order"".\n\nOn 29 May 2018, Electronic Arts released a free update to their video game FIFA 18 that added content related to the 2018 FIFA World Cup.The expansion included a World Cup tournament mode with all teams and stadiums from the event, official television presentation elements, and World Cup-related content for the Ultimate Team mode.\n\nPanini continued their partnership with FIFA by producing stickers for their World Cup sticker album.Panini also developed an app for the 2018 World Cup where fans could collect and swap virtual stickers, with 5 million fans gathering digital stickers for the tournament.\n\nThe tournament\'s official mascot was unveiled on 21 October 2016, and selected through a design competition among university students.A public vote was used to select the mascot from three finalists—a cat, a tiger, and a wolf.The winner, with 53% or approximately 1 million votes, was Zabivaka—an anthropomorphic wolf dressed in the colours of the Russian national team.Zabivaka\'s name is a portmanteau of the Russian words забияка (""hothead"") and забивать (""to score""), and his official backstory states that he is an aspiring football player who is ""charming, confident and social"".\n\nThe official match ball, the ""Telstar 18"", was unveiled on 9 November 2017.It was based on the name and design of the first Adidas World Cup ball from 1970.A special red-coloured variation, ""Telstar Mechta"", was used for the knockout stage of the tournament.The word mechta (Russian: мечта) means ""dream"" or ""ambition"".\n\nGoalkeepers noted that the ball was slippery and prone to having unpredictable trajectory.In addition, two Telstar 18 balls popped in the midst of a first-round match between France and Australia, leading to further discussions over the ball\'s performance.\n\nThe official song of the tournament was ""Live It Up"", with vocals by Will Smith, Nicky Jam and Era Istrefi, released on 25 May 2018.Its music video was released on 8 June 2018.\n\nThirty-three footballers who were alleged to be part of the Russian steroid programme are listed in the McLaren Report.On 22 December 2017, it was reported that FIFA had fired a doctor who had been investigating doping in Russian football.On 22 May 2018, FIFA stated that the investigations concerning all Russian players named for the provisional squad of the FIFA World Cup in Russia had been completed, with the result that insufficient evidence was found to support anti-doping rule violations.FIFA\'s medical committee also decided that Russian personnel would not be involved in performing drug testing procedures at the tournament, an action taken to reassure teams that samples would not be tampered with.\n\nRussia relaxed its visa rules during the World Cup, allowing Fan ID holders to enter and exit Russia without a visa through 31 December 2018.Traffickers exploited this system to bring foreign sex trafficking victims into the country, especially from Nigeria.Reuters had raised concerns about the victims\' conditions, who had allegedly been forced into prostitution, with some of them enduring violent abuse.Russian authorities were accused of doing little to fix to the issue, allegedly because many locals blamed the victims for falling into prostitution.\n\nIn response to the March 2018 poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, British prime minister Theresa May announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans.Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that the West are trying to ""take the World Cup out of Russia"".The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced Boris Johnson\'s statements that compared the event to the 1936 Olympics held in Nazi Germany as ""poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness"" and ""unacceptable and unworthy"" parallel towards Russia, a ""nation that lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism"".\n\nAt the close of the World Cup, Russia was widely praised for its success in hosting the tournament, with Steve Rosenberg of the BBC deeming it ""a resounding public relations success"" for Putin, adding: ""The stunning new stadiums, free train travel to venues and the absence of crowd violence has impressed visiting supporters.Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country\'s authoritarian image.All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised.""\n\nDespite the British Foreign Office and MPs repeatedly warning English football fans travelling to Russia of ""racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility"", fans who did travel said they received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino stated: ""Everyone discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, that is keen to show the world that everything that has been said before might not be true.A lot of preconceived ideas have been changed because people have seen the true nature of Russia.""Infantino has proclaimed Russia 2018 to be ""the best World Cup ever.""98 percent of the stadiums were sold out, there were 3 billion viewers on TV around the world and 7 million fans visited the fan fests.It was the most viewed World Cup to date, and the third most viewed television broadcast, surpassing the Beijing Olympics in 2008.\n\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters.After having tested the technology at limited matches of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the 2014 FIFA World Cup (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of Rio de Janeiro), the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in 4K ultra high definition.Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut of each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being converted up from 1080p high definition sources with limited degradation in quality.These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder UA:PBC stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup due to existing tensions with Russia amidst the Russo-Ukrainian War.This came in the wake of growing boycott of the tournament by the Football Federation of Ukraine and sports minister Ihor Zhdanov.Additionally, the FFU refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing diplomatic crisis in Qatar, which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar—the home country of FIFA\'s Middle East and Africa rightsholder beIN Sports—in June 2017, over its alleged state support of terrorist groups.On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from Du and Etisalat, but with service to the latter restored later that day.Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as ""beoutQ"".While FIFA attempted to negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final indirectly, they were unable to do so.On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had ""engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.""\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men\'s World Cup whose English rights were held by Fox Sports, and Spanish rights held by Telemundo.The elimination of the United States in the qualifiers led to concerns that U.S. interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that ""casual"" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5 million in 2014, and determined how much Fox paid for the rights.During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among Hispanic and Latino Americans.Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of tournament coverage.Viewership was down overall compared to 2014; match scheduling and time zones were not as favourable to viewers in the Americas as they were in 2014.Many games aired in the morning hours, although Telemundo\'s broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday daytime program in the network\'s history.\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, Korean Central Television acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea.Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time.In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to strained relations and campaigns against the country.\n\nA combined 3.572 billion unique viewers (live global 1-minute reach) – more than half of the global population aged four and over – tuned in to world football\'s ultimate competition, according to audience data for official broadcast coverage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe average global live audience for every game of the tournament was 191 million viewers (for a cumulative live audience of 12.224 billion viewers), a 2.1% increase over the 2014 tournament average of 187 million viewers, including that average audience in the early stages (group stage and round of 16) were bigger than in 2014.However, in 2018, the audience was 15 percent smaller for the semi-finals, 17 percent for the third place play-off, and 5.1 percent for the final, which was watched by 517 million people on average (only in-home TV viewers), compared to 545 million in 2014.Presumably, the reason for that is the smaller countries involved in the top four games compared to those in 2014, and only one global region (Europe) being represented in 2018 (compared to South America and Europe in 2014).However the live global 1-minute reach of the final was 1.12 billion people (884.37 in-home TV viewers and 231.82 million out-of-home and (or) digital-only viewers).\n\nFIFA World Cup FIFA World Cup hosts 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup 2019 FIFA Women\'s World Cup\n', 'Claim_Context': ""Croatian player Luka Modrić

2,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018 FIFA World Cup', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The 2018 FIFA World Cup was the 21st FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for national football teams organized by FIFA.It took place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in late 2010.It was the eleventh time the championships had been held in Europe, the first time they were held in Eastern Europe, and the first time they were held across two continents (Europe and Asia).At an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion, it was the most expensive World Cup ever held until it was surpassed by the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nThe tournament phase involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through qualifying competitions, while the host nation Russia qualified automatically.Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the 2014 event, while Iceland and Panama each made their debut at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities.Germany, the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage for the first time since 1938.Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals.In the final, France played Croatia on 15 July at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.France won the match 4–2, claiming their second World Cup and becoming the fourth consecutive title won by a European team, after Italy in 2006, Spain in 2010, and Germany in 2014.\n\nCroatian player Luka Modrić was voted the tournament\'s best player, winning the Golden Ball.England\'s Harry Kane won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals during the tournament with six.Belgium\'s Thibaut Courtois won the Golden Glove, awarded to the goalkeeper with the best performance.It has been estimated that more than 3 million people attended games during the tournament.\n\nThe bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest.Initially, nine countries placed bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico later withdrew from the proceedings, and Indonesia\'s bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian government failed to submit a letter to support the bid.During the bidding process, the three remaining non-UEFA nations (Australia, Japan, and the United States) gradually withdrew from the 2018 bids, and thus all UEFA nations were ruled out of the 2022 bid.As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.\n\nThe 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting.The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third.England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.\n\nThe voting results were:\n\nThe choice of Russia as host was controversial.Issues included the high level of racism in Russian football, human rights abuses by Russian authorities, and discrimination against LGBT people in government (including gay propaganda laws) along with wider Russian society.Russia\'s involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine had also prompted calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the annexation of Crimea.In 2014, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that ""the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work"".\n\nRussia was criticised for alleged abuse of migrant labourers in the construction of World Cup venues, with Human Rights Watch reporting cases where workers were left unpaid, made to work in dangerously cold conditions, or suffering reprisals for raising concerns.A few pundits claimed it was slave labour.In May 2017, FIFA president Gianni Infantino admitted there had been human rights abuses of North Korean workers involved in the construction of Saint Petersburg\'s Zenit Arena.By June 2017, at least 17 workers had died on World Cup construction sites, according to Building and Wood Workers\' International.In August, a group of eight US senators called on FIFA to consider dismissing Russia as the World Cup host if an independent investigation verified allegations of North Koreans being subjected to forced labor.\n\nRacism and Neo-nazi symbols displayed in the past by some Russian football fans drew criticism, with documented incidents of racial chants, banners spewing hate-filled messages, and sometimes assaults on people from the Caucasus and Central Asia.In March 2015, FIFA\'s then Vice President Jeffrey Webb said that Russia posed a huge challenge from a racism standpoint, and that a World Cup could not be held there under the current conditions.On July, United Nations anti-discrimination official Yuri Boychenko said that Russian soccer authorities had failed to fully grasp what racism was and needed to do more to combat it.To address this as well as concerns of hooliganism in general, Russian intelligence services blacklisted over 400 fans from entering the stadiums by June 2018, with 32 other countries also sending officers to help local police screen attendees for valid ID cards.\n\nAllegations of corruption in the bidding processes and concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups led to threats from England\'s FA to boycott the tournament.They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and Sepp Blatter had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.FIFA appointed Michael J. Garcia, a US attorney, to investigate and produce a report on the corruption allegations.Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert.Eckert\'s summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert\'s absolving Russia from blame.Greg Dyke called for a re-examination of the affair and David Bernstein called for a boycott of the World Cup.Garcia criticised the summary as being ""materially incomplete"" with ""erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions"", and appealed to FIFA\'s Appeal Committee.The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned to protest of FIFA\'s conduct, citing a ""lack of leadership"" and lack of confidence in Eckert\'s independence.\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the FBI confirmed that federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.In an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA\'s Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that ""should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled"".Prince William of Wales and former British Prime Minister David Cameron attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in England was discussed.\n\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations—the 209 FIFA member associations except automatically qualified hosts Russia—applied to enter the qualifying process.Zimbabwe and Indonesia were later disqualified before playing their first matches, while Gibraltar and Kosovo, who joined FIFA on 13 May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.The first qualification game, between Timor-Leste and Mongolia, began in Dili on 12 March 2015 as part of the AFC\'s qualification, and the main qualifying draw took place at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, on 25 July 2015.\n\nOf the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2014.Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the smallest country in terms of population to reach the World Cup.Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments included: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, who last appeared in 1982; Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002.Poland, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Sweden have also returned after 12 years.It was the first time three Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four Arab nations (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.\n\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions Italy (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden and were the highest-ranked team to not qualify; and the Netherlands, who were three-time runners-up and had finished in third place in 2014, had qualified for the last three World Cups, and failed to qualify for their second major tournament in a row, missing out on the UEFA Euro 2016 as well.Four reigning continental champions: 2017 Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon; two-time Copa América champions and 2017 Confederations Cup runners-up Chile; 2016 OFC Nations Cup winners New Zealand; and 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup champions the United States (for the first time since 1986) also failed to qualify.The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Ghana and Ivory Coast, both of which had qualified for the three previous tournaments.The lowest-ranked team to qualify was the host nation, Russia.\n\nNote: Numbers in parentheses indicate positions in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the tournament.\n\nAFC (5) (36) (37) (61) (67) (57)\n\nCAF (5) (45) (41) (48) (27) (21)\n\nCONCACAF (3) (23) (15)

December 2017 at 18:00 MSK at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow.The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, by selecting one team from each of the four ranked pots.\n\nFor the draw, the teams were allocated to four pots based entirely on the FIFA World Rankings of October 2017.Pot one contained the hosts Russia (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams.Pot two contained the next best eight teams, and so on for pots three and four.This was different from previous draws, when only pot one was based on FIFA rankings while the remaining pots were based on geographical considerations.However, teams from the same confederation still were not drawn against each other for the group stage, except that two UEFA teams could be in each group.The pots for the draw are shown below.\n\nInitially, each team had to name a preliminary squad of 30 players, but in February 2018 this was increased to 35.From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 23 players (three of whom had to be goalkeepers) by 4 June.Players in the final squad could be replaced for serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team\'s first match.These replacements did not need to have been named in the preliminary squad.\n\nFor players named in the 35-player preliminary squad, there was a mandatory rest period between 21 and 27 May 2018, except for those involved in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final played on 26 May.\n\nOn 29 March 2018, FIFA released the list of 36 referees and 63 assistant referees selected to oversee matches.On 30 April 2018, FIFA released the list of 13 video assistant referees, who acted solely in this capacity in the tournament.\n\nReferee Fahad Al-Mirdasi of Saudi Arabia was removed on 30 May 2018 over a match-fixing attempt, along with his two assistant referees, compatriots Mohammed Al-Abakry and Abdulah Al-Shalwai.A new referee was not appointed, but two assistant referees, Hasan Al Mahri of the United Arab Emirates and Hiroshi Yamauchi of Japan, were added to the list.Assistant referee Marwa Range of Kenya also withdrew after the BBC released an investigation conducted by a Ghanaian journalist which implicated him in a bribery scandal.\n\nShortly after the International Football Association Board\'s decision to incorporate video assistant referees (VARs) into the Laws of the game (LOTG) on 16 March 2018, the FIFA Council took the much-anticipated step of approving the use of VAR for the first time in a FIFA World Cup tournament.\n\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees.Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums\' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.\n\nVAR had a significant impact on several games.On 15 June 2018, Diego Costa\'s first goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision; the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16 June and resulted in a goal by Antoine Griezmann.A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, a phenomenon partially attributed to VAR.Overall, the new technology was both praised and criticised by commentators.FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.\n\nRussia proposed the following host cities: Kaliningrad, Kazan, Krasnodar, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg, Samara, Saransk, Sochi, Volgograd, Yaroslavl, and Yekaterinburg.Each chosen city was located in European Russia (except Yekaterinburg, which is located in Asia but lies very close to the Europe-Asia border) in order to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country.The bid evaluation report stated: ""The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA\'s minimum requirement.Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.""\n\nIn October 2011, Russia reduced the number of stadiums from 16 to 14.Construction of the proposed Podolsk stadium in the Moscow Oblast was cancelled by the regional government.Also, in the capital, Otkritie Arena was competing with Dynamo Stadium over which would be constructed first.\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29 September 2012.The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list.Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8 billion was spent on hosting the tournament.\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.He also said, ""We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums in South Africa, where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums"".\n\nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA\'s inspection committee and its head, Chris Unger, visited St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues.They were satisfied with the progress.On 8 October 2015, FIFA and the local organising committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums to be used during the tournament.Of the twelve venues, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium—the two largest stadiums in Russia—were used most; both hosted seven matches.Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara each hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Otkritie Stadium in Moscow and the Rostov Stadium hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each.Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk each hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\n\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Between 2010 (when Russia were announced as hosts) and 2018, nine of the twelve stadiums were built (some in place of older, outdated venues) and the other three were renovated for the tournament.Kaliningrad: Kaliningrad Stadium (new).The first piles were driven into the ground in September 2015.On 11 April 2018 it hosted its first match.Kazan: Kazan Arena (new).The stadium was built for the 2013 Summer Universiade.It has since hosted the 2015 World Aquatics Championships and the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup.It serves as a home arena for FC Rubin Kazan.Moscow: Luzhniki Stadium (heavily renovated).The largest stadium in the country, it was closed for renovation in 2013.It was commissioned in November 2017.Moscow: Spartak Stadium (new).This stadium is the home arena to its namesake FC Spartak Moscow.In accordance with FIFA requirements, during the

over $14.2 billion , the 2018 FIFA event was the most expensive World Cup in history, surpassing the $11.6 billion cost of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.\n\nThe Russian government had originally earmarked a budget of around $20 billion, which was later slashed to $10 billion, for World Cup preparations.Half was spent on transportation infrastructure.As part of the program to prepare for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a federal sub-program—""Construction and Renovation of Transport Infrastructure""—was implemented with a total budget of ₽352.5 billion (rubles), with ₽170.3 billion coming from the federal budget, ₽35.1 billion from regional budgets, and ₽147.1 billion from investors.The biggest item of federal spending was the aviation infrastructure costing ₽117.8 billion.Construction of new hotels was a crucial area of infrastructure development in World Cup host cities.Costs continued to mount as preparations were underway.\n\nPlatov International Airport in Rostov-on-Don was upgraded with automated air traffic control systems.Modern surveillance, navigation, communication, control, and meteorological support systems were also installed.Koltsovo Airport in Yekaterinburg was upgraded with radio-engineering tools for flight operation and received a second runway.Saransk Airport received a new navigation system; two new hotels were constructed in the city—the Mercure Saransk Centre (Accor Hotels) and Four Points by Sheraton Saransk as well as few other smaller accommodation facilities.In Samara, new tram lines were laid.Khrabrovo Airport in Kaliningrad was upgraded with radio navigation and weather equipment.Renovation and upgraded radio-engineering tools for flight operations was completed in the Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Volgograd, Samara, Yekaterinburg, Kazan and Sochi airports.On 27 March, the Russian Ministry of Construction Industry, Housing and Utilities Sector of reported that all communications within its area of responsibility had been commissioned.The last facility commissioned was a waste treatment station in Volgograd.In Yekaterinburg, where four matches were hosted, hosting costs increased to over ₽7.4 billion, exceeding the ₽5.6 billion rubles originally allocated from the state and regional budget.\n\nVolunteer applications to the 2018 Russia Local Organising Committee opened on 1 June 2016.The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Volunteer Program received about 177,000 applications, and engaged a total of 35,000 volunteers.They received training at 15 Volunteer Centres of the local organising committee based in 15 universities, and in volunteer centres in the host cities.Preference, especially in key areas, was given to those with knowledge of a foreign language and volunteering experience, but not necessarily to Russian nationals.\n\nFree public transport services were offered for ticketholders during the World Cup, including additional trains linking host cities, as well as services such as bus services within them.\n\nThe full schedule was announced by FIFA on 24 July 2015 without kick-off times, which were confirmed later.On 1 December 2017, following the final draw, FIFA adjusted six kick-off times.\n\nRussia was placed in position A1 in the group stage and played in the opening match at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on 14 June against Saudi Arabia, the two lowest-ranked teams of the tournament at the time of the final draw.The Luzhniki Stadium also hosted the second semi-final on 11 July and the final on 15 July.The Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg hosted the first semi-final on 10 July and the third place play-off on 14 July.\n\nThe opening ceremony took place on Thursday, 14 June 2018, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, preceding the opening match of the tournament between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia.\n\nAt the start of the ceremony, Russian president Vladimir Putin gave a speech, welcoming the countries of the world to Russia and calling football a uniting force.Brazilian World Cup-winning striker Ronaldo entered the stadium with a child in a Russia jersey.Pop singer Robbie Williams then sang two of his songs solo before he and Russian soprano Aida Garifullina performed a duet.Dancers dressed in the flags of the 32 competing teams appeared carrying a sign with the name of each nation.At the end of the ceremony Ronaldo reappeared with the official match ball which had returned from the International Space Station in early June.\n\nYoung participants of the international children\'s social programme Football for Friendship from 211 countries and regions took part in the opening ceremony of the FIFA World Cup at the Luzhniki stadium.\n\nCompeting countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H).Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage.Ten European teams and four South American teams progressed to the knockout stage, together with Japan and Mexico.\n\nFor the first time since 1938, Germany, the reigning champions, were eliminated in the first round.This was the third consecutive tournament in which the holders were eliminated in the first round, after Italy in 2010 and Spain in 2014.No African team progressed to the second round for the first time since 1982.The fair play criteria came into use for the first time when Japan qualified over Senegal because the team had received fewer yellow cards.Only one match, France versus Denmark, was goalless.Until then there were a record 36 straight games in which at least one goal was scored.All times listed below are local time.\n\nIn the knockout stages, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winners.If a match went into extra time, each team was allowed to make a fourth substitution, the first time this had been allowed in a FIFA World Cup tournament.Below is the bracket for the knockout round of the tournament, teams in bold denote match winners.\n\nIn total, only four players were sent off in the entire tournament, the fewest since 1978.International Football Association Board technical director David Elleray stated a belief that this was due to the introduction of VAR, since players would know that they would not be able to get away with anything under the new system.\n\nA player is automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences: Receiving a red card (red card suspensions may be extended for serious offences)Receiving two yellow cards in two matches; yellow cards expire after the completion of the quarter-finals (yellow card suspensions are not carried forward to any other future international matches)\n\nThe following suspensions were served during the tournament:\n\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament.The Golden Boot (top scorer), Golden Ball (best overall player) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper) awards were all sponsored by Adidas.\n\nThe users of FIFA.com elected their Fan Dream Team.\n\nAdditionally, FIFA.com shortlisted 18 goals for users to vote on as the tournament\'s best.The poll closed on 23 July.The award was sponsored by Hyundai.\n\nFIFA published an All-Star Team, this year called the Fantasy Team, based on player performances evaluated through statistical data.\n\nPrize money amounts were announced in October 2017.\n\nThe tournament logo was unveiled on 28 October 2014 by cosmonauts at the International Space Station and then projected onto Moscow\'s Bolshoi Theatre during an evening television programme.Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said the logo was inspired by ""Russia\'s rich artistic tradition and its history of bold achievement and innovation"", and FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that it reflected the ""heart and soul"" of the country.For branding, Portuguese design agency Brandia Central created materials in 2014, with a typeface called Dusha – – designed by Brandia Central and edited by Adotbelow of the DSType Foundry in Portugal.\n\nThe first phase of ticket sales started on 14 September 2017, 12:00 Moscow Time, and lasted until 12 October 2017.\n\nThe general visa policy of Russia did not apply to participants and spectators, who were able to visit Russia without a visa right before and during the competition regardless of their citizenship.Spectators were nonetheless required to register for a ""Fan-ID"", a special photo identification pass.A Fan-ID was required to enter the country visa-free, while a ticket, Fan-ID and a valid passport were required to enter stadiums for matches.Fan-IDs also granted World Cup attendees free access to public transport services, including buses, and train service between host cities.Fan-ID was administered by the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, which could revoke this accreditation at any time to ""ensure the defence capability or security of the state or public order"".\n\nOn 29 May 2018, Electronic Arts released a free update to their video game FIFA 18 that added content related to the 2018 FIFA World Cup.The expansion included a World Cup tournament mode with all teams and stadiums from the event, official television presentation elements, and World Cup-related content for the Ultimate Team mode.\n\nPanini continued their partnership with FIFA by producing stickers for their World Cup sticker album.Panini also developed an app for the 2018 World Cup where fans could collect and swap virtual stickers, with 5 million fans gathering digital stickers for the tournament.\n\nThe tournament\'s official mascot was unveiled on 21 October 2016, and selected through a design competition among university students.A public vote was used to select the mascot from three finalists—a cat, a tiger, and a wolf.The winner, with 53% or approximately 1 million votes, was Zabivaka—an anthropomorphic wolf dressed in the colours of the Russian national team.Zabivaka\'s name is a portmanteau of the Russian words забияка (""hothead"") and забивать (""to score""), and his official backstory states that he is an aspiring football player who is ""charming, confident and social"".\n\nThe official match ball, the ""Telstar 18"", was unveiled on 9 November 2017.It was based on the name and design of the first Adidas World Cup ball from 1970.A special red-coloured variation, ""Telstar Mechta"", was used for the knockout stage of the tournament.The word mechta (Russian: мечта) means ""dream"" or ""ambition"".\n\nGoalkeepers noted that the ball was slippery and prone to having unpredictable trajectory.In addition, two Telstar 18 balls popped in the midst of a first-round match between France and Australia, leading to further discussions over the ball\'s performance.\n\nThe official song of the tournament was ""Live It Up"", with vocals by Will Smith, Nicky Jam and Era Istrefi, released on 25 May 2018.Its music video was released on 8 June 2018.\n\nThirty-three footballers who were alleged to be part of the Russian steroid programme are listed in the McLaren Report.On 22 December 2017, it was reported that FIFA had fired a doctor who had been investigating doping in Russian football.On 22 May 2018, FIFA stated that the investigations concerning all Russian players named for the provisional squad of the FIFA World Cup in Russia had been completed, with the result that insufficient evidence was found to support anti-doping rule violations.FIFA\'s medical committee also decided that Russian personnel would not be involved in performing drug testing procedures at the tournament, an action taken to reassure teams that samples would not be tampered with.\n\nRussia relaxed its visa rules during the World Cup, allowing Fan ID holders to enter and exit Russia without a visa through 31 December 2018.Traffickers exploited this system to bring foreign sex trafficking victims into the country, especially from Nigeria.Reuters had raised concerns about the victims\' conditions, who had allegedly been forced into prostitution, with some of them enduring violent abuse.Russian authorities were accused of doing little to fix to the issue, allegedly because many locals blamed the victims for falling into prostitution.\n\nIn response to the March 2018 poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, British prime minister Theresa May announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans.Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that the West are trying to ""take the World Cup out of Russia"".The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced Boris Johnson\'s statements that compared the event to the 1936 Olympics held in Nazi Germany as ""poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness"" and ""unacceptable and unworthy"" parallel towards Russia, a ""nation that lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism"".\n\nAt the close of the World Cup, Russia was widely praised for its success in hosting the tournament, with Steve Rosenberg of the BBC deeming it ""a resounding public relations success"" for Putin, adding: ""The stunning new stadiums, free train travel to venues and the absence of crowd violence has impressed visiting supporters.Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country\'s authoritarian image.All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised.""\n\nDespite the British Foreign Office and MPs repeatedly warning English football fans travelling to Russia of ""racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility"", fans who did travel said they received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino stated: ""Everyone discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, that is keen to show the world that everything that has been said before might not be true.A lot of preconceived ideas have been changed because people have seen the true nature of Russia.""Infantino has proclaimed Russia 2018 to be ""the best World Cup ever.""98 percent of the stadiums were sold out, there were 3 billion viewers on TV around the world and 7 million fans visited the fan fests.It was the most viewed World Cup to date, and the third most viewed television broadcast, surpassing the Beijing Olympics in 2008.\n\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters.After having tested the technology at limited matches of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the 2014 FIFA World Cup (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of Rio de Janeiro), the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in 4K ultra high definition.Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut of each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being converted up from 1080p high definition sources with limited degradation in quality.These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder UA:PBC stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup due to existing tensions with Russia amidst the Russo-Ukrainian War.This came in the wake of growing boycott of the tournament by the Football Federation of Ukraine and sports minister Ihor Zhdanov.Additionally, the FFU refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing diplomatic crisis in Qatar, which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar—the home country of FIFA\'s Middle East and Africa rightsholder beIN Sports—in June 2017, over its alleged state support of terrorist groups.On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from Du and Etisalat, but with service to the latter restored later that day.Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as ""beoutQ"".While FIFA attempted to negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final indirectly, they were unable to do so.On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had ""engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.""\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men\'s World Cup whose English rights were held by Fox Sports, and Spanish rights held by Telemundo.The elimination of the United States in the qualifiers led to concerns that U.S. interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that ""casual"" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5 million in 2014, and determined how much Fox paid for the rights.During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among Hispanic and Latino Americans.Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of tournament coverage.Viewership was down overall compared to 2014; match scheduling and time zones were not as favourable to viewers in the Americas as they were in 2014.Many games aired in the morning hours, although Telemundo\'s broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday daytime program in the network\'s history.\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, Korean Central Television acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea.Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time.In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to strained relations and campaigns against the country.\n\nA combined 3.572 billion unique viewers (live global 1-minute reach) – more than half of the global population aged four and over – tuned in to world football\'s ultimate competition, according to audience data for official broadcast coverage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe average global live audience for every game of the tournament was 191 million viewers (for a cumulative live audience of 12.224 billion viewers), a 2.1% increase over the 2014 tournament average of 187 million viewers, including that average audience in the early stages (group stage and round of 16) were bigger than in 2014.However, in 2018, the audience was 15 percent smaller for the semi-finals, 17 percent for the third place play-off, and 5.1 percent for the final, which was watched by 517 million people on average (only in-home TV viewers), compared to 545 million in 2014.Presumably, the reason for that is the smaller countries involved in the top four games compared to those in 2014, and only one global region (Europe) being represented in 2018 (compared to South America and Europe in 2014).However the live global 1-minute reach of the final was 1.12 billion people (884.37 in-home TV viewers and 231.82 million out-of-home and (or) digital-only viewers).\n\nFIFA World Cup FIFA World Cup hosts 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup 2019 FIFA Women\'s World Cup\n', 'Claim_Context': ""Croatian player Luka Modrić

3,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018 FIFA World Cup', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The 2018 FIFA World Cup was the 21st FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for national football teams organized by FIFA.It took place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in late 2010.It was the eleventh time the championships had been held in Europe, the first time they were held in Eastern Europe, and the first time they were held across two continents (Europe and Asia).At an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion, it was the most expensive World Cup ever held until it was surpassed by the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nThe tournament phase involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through qualifying competitions, while the host nation Russia qualified automatically.Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the 2014 event, while Iceland and Panama each made their debut at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities.Germany, the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage for the first time since 1938.Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals.In the final, France played Croatia on 15 July at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.France won the match 4–2, claiming their second World Cup and becoming the fourth consecutive title won by a European team, after Italy in 2006, Spain in 2010, and Germany in 2014.\n\nCroatian player Luka Modrić was voted the tournament\'s best player, winning the Golden Ball.England\'s Harry Kane won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals during the tournament with six.Belgium\'s Thibaut Courtois won the Golden Glove, awarded to the goalkeeper with the best performance.It has been estimated that more than 3 million people attended games during the tournament.\n\nThe bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest.Initially, nine countries placed bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico later withdrew from the proceedings, and Indonesia\'s bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian government failed to submit a letter to support the bid.During the bidding process, the three remaining non-UEFA nations (Australia, Japan, and the United States) gradually withdrew from the 2018 bids, and thus all UEFA nations were ruled out of the 2022 bid.As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.\n\nThe 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting.The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third.England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.\n\nThe voting results were:\n\nThe choice of Russia as host was controversial.Issues included the high level of racism in Russian football, human rights abuses by Russian authorities, and discrimination against LGBT people in government (including gay propaganda laws) along with wider Russian society.Russia\'s involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine had also prompted calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the annexation of Crimea.In 2014, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that ""the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work"".\n\nRussia was criticised for alleged abuse of migrant labourers in the construction of World Cup venues, with Human Rights Watch reporting cases where workers were left unpaid, made to work in dangerously cold conditions, or suffering reprisals for raising concerns.A few pundits claimed it was slave labour.In May 2017, FIFA president Gianni Infantino admitted there had been human rights abuses of North Korean workers involved in the construction of Saint Petersburg\'s Zenit Arena.By June 2017, at least 17 workers had died on World Cup construction sites, according to Building and Wood Workers\' International.In August, a group of eight US senators called on FIFA to consider dismissing Russia as the World Cup host if an independent investigation verified allegations of North Koreans being subjected to forced labor.\n\nRacism and Neo-nazi symbols displayed in the past by some Russian football fans drew criticism, with documented incidents of racial chants, banners spewing hate-filled messages, and sometimes assaults on people from the Caucasus and Central Asia.In March 2015, FIFA\'s then Vice President Jeffrey Webb said that Russia posed a huge challenge from a racism standpoint, and that a World Cup could not be held there under the current conditions.On July, United Nations anti-discrimination official Yuri Boychenko said that Russian soccer authorities had failed to fully grasp what racism was and needed to do more to combat it.To address this as well as concerns of hooliganism in general, Russian intelligence services blacklisted over 400 fans from entering the stadiums by June 2018, with 32 other countries also sending officers to help local police screen attendees for valid ID cards.\n\nAllegations of corruption in the bidding processes and concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups led to threats from England\'s FA to boycott the tournament.They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and Sepp Blatter had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.FIFA appointed Michael J. Garcia, a US attorney, to investigate and produce a report on the corruption allegations.Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert.Eckert\'s summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert\'s absolving Russia from blame.Greg Dyke called for a re-examination of the affair and David Bernstein called for a boycott of the World Cup.Garcia criticised the summary as being ""materially incomplete"" with ""erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions"", and appealed to FIFA\'s Appeal Committee.The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned to protest of FIFA\'s conduct, citing a ""lack of leadership"" and lack of confidence in Eckert\'s independence.\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the FBI confirmed that federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.In an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA\'s Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that ""should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled"".Prince William of Wales and former British Prime Minister David Cameron attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in England was discussed.\n\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations—the 209 FIFA member associations except automatically qualified hosts Russia—applied to enter the qualifying process.Zimbabwe and Indonesia were later disqualified before playing their first matches, while Gibraltar and Kosovo, who joined FIFA on 13 May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.The first qualification game, between Timor-Leste and Mongolia, began in Dili on 12 March 2015 as part of the AFC\'s qualification, and the main qualifying draw took place at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, on 25 July 2015.\n\nOf the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2014.Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the smallest country in terms of population to reach the World Cup.Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments included: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, who last appeared in 1982; Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002.Poland, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Sweden have also returned after 12 years.It was the first time three Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four Arab nations (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.\n\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions Italy (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden and were the highest-ranked team to not qualify; and the Netherlands, who were three-time runners-up and had finished in third place in 2014, had qualified for the last three World Cups, and failed to qualify for their second major tournament in a row, missing out on the UEFA Euro 2016 as well.Four reigning continental champions: 2017 Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon; two-time Copa América champions and 2017 Confederations Cup runners-up Chile; 2016 OFC Nations Cup winners New Zealand; and 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup champions the United States (for the first time since 1986) also failed to qualify.The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Ghana and Ivory Coast, both of which had qualified for the three previous tournaments.The lowest-ranked team to qualify was the host nation, Russia.\n\nNote: Numbers in parentheses indicate positions in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the tournament.\n\nAFC (5) (36) (37) (61) (67) (57)\n\nCAF (5) (45) (41) (48) (27) (21)\n\nCONCACAF (3) (23) (15)

December 2017 at 18:00 MSK at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow.The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, by selecting one team from each of the four ranked pots.\n\nFor the draw, the teams were allocated to four pots based entirely on the FIFA World Rankings of October 2017.Pot one contained the hosts Russia (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams.Pot two contained the next best eight teams, and so on for pots three and four.This was different from previous draws, when only pot one was based on FIFA rankings while the remaining pots were based on geographical considerations.However, teams from the same confederation still were not drawn against each other for the group stage, except that two UEFA teams could be in each group.The pots for the draw are shown below.\n\nInitially, each team had to name a preliminary squad of 30 players, but in February 2018 this was increased to 35.From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 23 players (three of whom had to be goalkeepers) by 4 June.Players in the final squad could be replaced for serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team\'s first match.These replacements did not need to have been named in the preliminary squad.\n\nFor players named in the 35-player preliminary squad, there was a mandatory rest period between 21 and 27 May 2018, except for those involved in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final played on 26 May.\n\nOn 29 March 2018, FIFA released the list of 36 referees and 63 assistant referees selected to oversee matches.On 30 April 2018, FIFA released the list of 13 video assistant referees, who acted solely in this capacity in the tournament.\n\nReferee Fahad Al-Mirdasi of Saudi Arabia was removed on 30 May 2018 over a match-fixing attempt, along with his two assistant referees, compatriots Mohammed Al-Abakry and Abdulah Al-Shalwai.A new referee was not appointed, but two assistant referees, Hasan Al Mahri of the United Arab Emirates and Hiroshi Yamauchi of Japan, were added to the list.Assistant referee Marwa Range of Kenya also withdrew after the BBC released an investigation conducted by a Ghanaian journalist which implicated him in a bribery scandal.\n\nShortly after the International Football Association Board\'s decision to incorporate video assistant referees (VARs) into the Laws of the game (LOTG) on 16 March 2018, the FIFA Council took the much-anticipated step of approving the use of VAR for the first time in a FIFA World Cup tournament.\n\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees.Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums\' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.\n\nVAR had a significant impact on several games.On 15 June 2018, Diego Costa\'s first goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision; the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16 June and resulted in a goal by Antoine Griezmann.A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, a phenomenon partially attributed to VAR.Overall, the new technology was both praised and criticised by commentators.FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.\n\nRussia proposed the following host cities: Kaliningrad, Kazan, Krasnodar, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg, Samara, Saransk, Sochi, Volgograd, Yaroslavl, and Yekaterinburg.Each chosen city was located in European Russia (except Yekaterinburg, which is located in Asia but lies very close to the Europe-Asia border) in order to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country.The bid evaluation report stated: ""The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA\'s minimum requirement.Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.""\n\nIn October 2011, Russia reduced the number of stadiums from 16 to 14.Construction of the proposed Podolsk stadium in the Moscow Oblast was cancelled by the regional government.Also, in the capital, Otkritie Arena was competing with Dynamo Stadium over which would be constructed first.\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29 September 2012.The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list.Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8 billion was spent on hosting the tournament.\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.He also said, ""We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums in South Africa, where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums"".\n\nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA\'s inspection committee and its head, Chris Unger, visited St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues.They were satisfied with the progress.On 8 October 2015, FIFA and the local organising committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums to be used during the tournament.Of the twelve venues, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium—the two largest stadiums in Russia—were used most; both hosted seven matches.Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara each hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Otkritie Stadium in Moscow and the Rostov Stadium hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each.Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk each hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\n\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Between 2010 (when Russia were announced as hosts) and 2018, nine of the twelve stadiums were built (some in place of older, outdated venues) and the other three were renovated for the tournament.Kaliningrad: Kaliningrad Stadium (new).The first piles were driven into the ground in September 2015.On 11 April 2018 it hosted its first match.Kazan: Kazan Arena (new).The stadium was built for the 2013 Summer Universiade.It has since hosted the 2015 World Aquatics Championships and the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup.It serves as a home arena for FC Rubin Kazan.Moscow: Luzhniki Stadium (heavily renovated).The largest stadium in the country, it was closed for renovation in 2013.It was commissioned in November 2017.Moscow: Spartak Stadium (new).This stadium is the home arena to its namesake FC Spartak Moscow.In accordance with FIFA requirements, during the 2018 World Cup, it was called Spartak Stadium instead of its usual name Otkritie Arena.It hosted its first match on 5 September 2014.Nizhny Novgorod: Nizhny Novgorod Stadium (new).Construction of this stadium commenced in 2015 and was completed in December 2017.Rostov-on-Don: Rostov Arena (new).The stadium is located on the left bank of the Don.Construction was completed on 22 December 2017.Saint Petersburg: Saint Petersburg Stadium (new).Construction commenced in 2007 after the site, formerly occupied by Kirov Stadium, was cleared.The project was officially completed on 29 December 2016.It has hosted 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup games and served as a venue for UEFA Euro 2020.Samara: Samara Arena (new).Construction officially started on 21 July 2014 and was completed on 21 April 2018.Saransk: Mordovia Arena (new).The stadium in Saransk was scheduled to be commissioned in 2012 in time for the opening of the all-Russian Spartakiad, but the plan was revised.The opening was rescheduled to 2017.The arena hosted its first match on 21 April 2018.Sochi: Fisht Stadium (slightly renovated).This stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics.Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup.Volgograd: Volgograd Arena (new).The main Volgograd arena was built on the demolished Central Stadium site, at the foot of the Mamayev Kurgan memorial complex.It was commissioned on 3 April 2018.Yekaterinburg: Ekaterinburg Arena (heavily renovated).The Central Stadium of Yekaterinburg had been renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Its stands have a capacity of 35,000 spectators.The renovation project was completed in December 2017.\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament.On 9 February 2018, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team.\n\nArgentina: Bronnitsy, Moscow Oblast Australia: Kazan, Tatarstan Belgium: Krasnogorsky, Moscow Oblast Brazil: Sochi, Krasnodar Krai Colombia: Verkhneuslonsky, Tatarstan Costa Rica: Saint Petersburg Croatia: Roshchino, Leningrad Oblast Denmark: Anapa,

over $14.2 billion , the 2018 FIFA event was the most expensive World Cup in history, surpassing the $11.6 billion cost of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.\n\nThe Russian government had originally earmarked a budget of around $20 billion, which was later slashed to $10 billion, for World Cup preparations.Half was spent on transportation infrastructure.As part of the program to prepare for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a federal sub-program—""Construction and Renovation of Transport Infrastructure""—was implemented with a total budget of ₽352.5 billion (rubles), with ₽170.3 billion coming from the federal budget, ₽35.1 billion from regional budgets, and ₽147.1 billion from investors.The biggest item of federal spending was the aviation infrastructure costing ₽117.8 billion.Construction of new hotels was a crucial area of infrastructure development in World Cup host cities.Costs continued to mount as preparations were underway.\n\nPlatov International Airport in Rostov-on-Don was upgraded with automated air traffic control systems.Modern surveillance, navigation, communication, control, and meteorological support systems were also installed.Koltsovo Airport in Yekaterinburg was upgraded with radio-engineering tools for flight operation and received a second runway.Saransk Airport received a new navigation system; two new hotels were constructed in the city—the Mercure Saransk Centre (Accor Hotels) and Four Points by Sheraton Saransk as well as few other smaller accommodation facilities.In Samara, new tram lines were laid.Khrabrovo Airport in Kaliningrad was upgraded with radio navigation and weather equipment.Renovation and upgraded radio-engineering tools for flight operations was completed in the Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Volgograd, Samara, Yekaterinburg, Kazan and Sochi airports.On 27 March, the Russian Ministry of Construction Industry, Housing and Utilities Sector of reported that all communications within its area of responsibility had been commissioned.The last facility commissioned was a waste treatment station in Volgograd.In Yekaterinburg, where four matches were hosted, hosting costs increased to over ₽7.4 billion, exceeding the ₽5.6 billion rubles originally allocated from the state and regional budget.\n\nVolunteer applications to the 2018 Russia Local Organising Committee opened on 1 June 2016.The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Volunteer Program received about 177,000 applications, and engaged a total of 35,000 volunteers.They received training at 15 Volunteer Centres of the local organising committee based in 15 universities, and in volunteer centres in the host cities.Preference, especially in key areas, was given to those with knowledge of a foreign language and volunteering experience, but not necessarily to Russian nationals.\n\nFree public transport services were offered for ticketholders during the World Cup, including additional trains linking host cities, as well as services such as bus services within them.\n\nThe full schedule was announced by FIFA on 24 July 2015 without kick-off times, which were confirmed later.On 1 December 2017, following the final draw, FIFA adjusted six kick-off times.\n\nRussia was placed in position A1 in the group stage and played in the opening match at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on 14 June against Saudi Arabia, the two lowest-ranked teams of the tournament at the time of the final draw.The Luzhniki Stadium also hosted the second semi-final on 11 July and the final on 15 July.The Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg hosted the first semi-final on 10 July and the third place play-off on 14 July.\n\nThe opening ceremony took place on Thursday, 14 June 2018, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, preceding the opening match of the tournament between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia.\n\nAt the start of the ceremony, Russian president Vladimir Putin gave a speech, welcoming the countries of the world to Russia and calling football a uniting force.Brazilian World Cup-winning striker Ronaldo entered the stadium with a child in a Russia jersey.Pop singer Robbie Williams then sang two of his songs solo before he and Russian soprano Aida Garifullina performed a duet.Dancers dressed in the flags of the 32 competing teams appeared carrying a sign with the name of each nation.At the end of the ceremony Ronaldo reappeared with the official match ball which had returned from the International Space Station in early June.\n\nYoung participants of the international children\'s social programme Football for Friendship from 211 countries and regions took part in the opening ceremony of the FIFA World Cup at the Luzhniki stadium.\n\nCompeting countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H).Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage.Ten European teams and four South American teams progressed to the knockout stage, together with Japan and Mexico.\n\nFor the first time since 1938, Germany, the reigning champions, were eliminated in the first round.This was the third consecutive tournament in which the holders were eliminated in the first round, after Italy in 2010 and Spain in 2014.No African team progressed to the second round for the first time since 1982.The fair play criteria came into use for the first time when Japan qualified over Senegal because the team had received fewer yellow cards.Only one match, France versus Denmark, was goalless.Until then there were a record 36 straight games in which at least one goal was scored.All times listed below are local time.\n\nIn the knockout stages, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winners.If a match went into extra time, each team was allowed to make a fourth substitution, the first time this had been allowed in a FIFA World Cup tournament.Below is the bracket for the knockout round of the tournament, teams in bold denote match winners.\n\nIn total, only four players were sent off in the entire tournament, the fewest since 1978.International Football Association Board technical director David Elleray stated a belief that this was due to the introduction of VAR, since players would know that they would not be able to get away with anything under the new system.\n\nA player is automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences: Receiving a red card (red card suspensions may be extended for serious offences)Receiving two yellow cards in two matches; yellow cards expire after the completion of the quarter-finals (yellow card suspensions are not carried forward to any other future international matches)\n\nThe following suspensions were served during the tournament:\n\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament.The Golden Boot (top scorer), Golden Ball (best overall player) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper) awards were all sponsored by Adidas.\n\nThe users of FIFA.com elected their Fan Dream Team.\n\nAdditionally, FIFA.com shortlisted 18 goals for users to vote on as the tournament\'s best.The poll closed on 23 July.The award was sponsored by Hyundai.\n\nFIFA published an All-Star Team, this year called the Fantasy Team, based on player performances evaluated through statistical data.\n\nPrize money amounts were announced in October 2017.\n\nThe tournament logo was unveiled on 28 October 2014 by cosmonauts at the International Space Station and then projected onto Moscow\'s Bolshoi Theatre during an evening television programme.Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said the logo was inspired by ""Russia\'s rich artistic tradition and its history of bold achievement and innovation"", and FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that it reflected the ""heart and soul"" of the country.For branding, Portuguese design agency Brandia Central created materials in 2014, with a typeface called Dusha – – designed by Brandia Central and edited by Adotbelow of the DSType Foundry in Portugal.\n\nThe first phase of ticket sales started on 14 September 2017, 12:00 Moscow Time, and lasted until 12 October 2017.\n\nThe general visa policy of Russia did not apply to participants and spectators, who were able to visit Russia without a visa right before and during the competition regardless of their citizenship.Spectators were nonetheless required to register for a ""Fan-ID"", a special photo identification pass.A Fan-ID was required to enter the country visa-free, while a ticket, Fan-ID and a valid passport were required to enter stadiums for matches.Fan-IDs also granted World Cup attendees free access to public transport services, including buses, and train service between host cities.Fan-ID was administered by the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, which could revoke this accreditation at any time to ""ensure the defence capability or security of the state or public order"".\n\nOn 29 May 2018, Electronic Arts released a free update to their video game FIFA 18 that added content related to the 2018 FIFA World Cup.The expansion included a World Cup tournament mode with all teams and stadiums from the event, official television presentation elements, and World Cup-related content for the Ultimate Team mode.\n\nPanini continued their partnership with FIFA by producing stickers for their World Cup sticker album.Panini also developed an app for the 2018 World Cup where fans could collect and swap virtual stickers, with 5 million fans gathering digital stickers for the tournament.\n\nThe tournament\'s official mascot was unveiled on 21 October 2016, and selected through a design competition among university students.A public vote was used to select the mascot from three finalists—a cat, a tiger, and a wolf.The winner, with 53% or approximately 1 million votes, was Zabivaka—an anthropomorphic wolf dressed in the colours of the Russian national team.Zabivaka\'s name is a portmanteau of the Russian words забияка (""hothead"") and забивать (""to score""), and his official backstory states that he is an aspiring football player who is ""charming, confident and social"".\n\nThe official match ball, the ""Telstar 18"", was unveiled on 9 November 2017.It was based on the name and design of the first Adidas World Cup ball from 1970.A special red-coloured variation, ""Telstar Mechta"", was used for the knockout stage of the tournament.The word mechta (Russian: мечта) means ""dream"" or ""ambition"".\n\nGoalkeepers noted that the ball was slippery and prone to having unpredictable trajectory.In addition, two Telstar 18 balls popped in the midst of a first-round match between France and Australia, leading to further discussions over the ball\'s performance.\n\nThe official song of the tournament was ""Live It Up"", with vocals by Will Smith, Nicky Jam and Era Istrefi, released on 25 May 2018.Its music video was released on 8 June 2018.\n\nThirty-three footballers who were alleged to be part of the Russian steroid programme are listed in the McLaren Report.On 22 December 2017, it was reported that FIFA had fired a doctor who had been investigating doping in Russian football.On 22 May 2018, FIFA stated that the investigations concerning all Russian players named for the provisional squad of the FIFA World Cup in Russia had been completed, with the result that insufficient evidence was found to support anti-doping rule violations.FIFA\'s medical committee also decided that Russian personnel would not be involved in performing drug testing procedures at the tournament, an action taken to reassure teams that samples would not be tampered with.\n\nRussia relaxed its visa rules during the World Cup, allowing Fan ID holders to enter and exit Russia without a visa through 31 December 2018.Traffickers exploited this system to bring foreign sex trafficking victims into the country, especially from Nigeria.Reuters had raised concerns about the victims\' conditions, who had allegedly been forced into prostitution, with some of them enduring violent abuse.Russian authorities were accused of doing little to fix to the issue, allegedly because many locals blamed the victims for falling into prostitution.\n\nIn response to the March 2018 poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, British prime minister Theresa May announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans.Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that the West are trying to ""take the World Cup out of Russia"".The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced Boris Johnson\'s statements that compared the event to the 1936 Olympics held in Nazi Germany as ""poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness"" and ""unacceptable and unworthy"" parallel towards Russia, a ""nation that lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism"".\n\nAt the close of the World Cup, Russia was widely praised for its success in hosting the tournament, with Steve Rosenberg of the BBC deeming it ""a resounding public relations success"" for Putin, adding: ""The stunning new stadiums, free train travel to venues and the absence of crowd violence has impressed visiting supporters.Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country\'s authoritarian image.All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised.""\n\nDespite the British Foreign Office and MPs repeatedly warning English football fans travelling to Russia of ""racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility"", fans who did travel said they received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino stated: ""Everyone discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, that is keen to show the world that everything that has been said before might not be true.A lot of preconceived ideas have been changed because people have seen the true nature of Russia.""Infantino has proclaimed Russia 2018 to be ""the best World Cup ever.""98 percent of the stadiums were sold out, there were 3 billion viewers on TV around the world and 7 million fans visited the fan fests.It was the most viewed World Cup to date, and the third most viewed television broadcast, surpassing the Beijing Olympics in 2008.\n\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters.After having tested the technology at limited matches of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the 2014 FIFA World Cup (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of Rio de Janeiro), the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in 4K ultra high definition.Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut of each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being converted up from 1080p high definition sources with limited degradation in quality.These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder UA:PBC stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup due to existing tensions with Russia amidst the Russo-Ukrainian War.This came in the wake of growing boycott of the tournament by the Football Federation of Ukraine and sports minister Ihor Zhdanov.Additionally, the FFU refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing diplomatic crisis in Qatar, which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar—the home country of FIFA\'s Middle East and Africa rightsholder beIN Sports—in June 2017, over its alleged state support of terrorist groups.On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from Du and Etisalat, but with service to the latter restored later that day.Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as ""beoutQ"".While FIFA attempted to negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final indirectly, they were unable to do so.On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had ""engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.""\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men\'s World Cup whose English rights were held by Fox Sports, and Spanish rights held by Telemundo.The elimination of the United States in the qualifiers led to concerns that U.S. interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that ""casual"" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5 million in 2014, and determined how much Fox paid for the rights.During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among Hispanic and Latino Americans.Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of tournament coverage.Viewership was down overall compared to 2014; match scheduling and time zones were not as favourable to viewers in the Americas as they were in 2014.Many games aired in the morning hours, although Telemundo\'s broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday daytime program in the network\'s history.\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, Korean Central Television acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea.Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time.In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to strained relations and campaigns against the country.\n\nA combined 3.572 billion unique viewers (live global 1-minute reach) – more than half of the global population aged four and over – tuned in to world football\'s ultimate competition, according to audience data for official broadcast coverage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe average global live audience for every game of the tournament was 191 million viewers (for a cumulative live audience of 12.224 billion viewers), a 2.1% increase over the 2014 tournament average of 187 million viewers, including that average audience in the early stages (group stage and round of 16) were bigger than in 2014.However, in 2018, the audience was 15 percent smaller for the semi-finals, 17 percent for the third place play-off, and 5.1 percent for the final, which was watched by 517 million people on average (only in-home TV viewers), compared to 545 million in 2014.Presumably, the reason for that is the smaller countries involved in the top four games compared to those in 2014, and only one global region (Europe) being represented in 2018 (compared to South America and Europe in 2014).However the live global 1-minute reach of the final was 1.12 billion people (884.37 in-home TV viewers and 231.82 million out-of-home and (or) digital-only viewers).\n\nFIFA World Cup FIFA World Cup hosts 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup 2019 FIFA Women\'s World Cup\n', 'Claim_Context': ""Croatian player Luka Modrić

procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest.Initially, nine countries placed bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico later withdrew from the proceedings, and Indonesia\'s bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian government failed to submit a letter to support the bid.During the bidding process, the three remaining non-UEFA nations (Australia, Japan, and the United States) gradually withdrew from the 2018 bids, and thus all UEFA nations were ruled out of the 2022 bid.As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.\n\nThe 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting.The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third.England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.\n\nThe voting results were:\n\nThe choice of Russia as host was controversial.Issues included the high level of racism in Russian football, human rights abuses by Russian authorities, and discrimination against LGBT people in government (including gay propaganda laws) along with wider Russian society.Russia\'s involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine had also prompted calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the annexation of Crimea.In 2014, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that ""the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work"".\n\nRussia was criticised for alleged abuse of migrant labourers in the construction of World Cup venues, with Human Rights Watch reporting cases where workers were left unpaid, made to work in dangerously cold conditions, or suffering reprisals for raising concerns.A few pundits claimed it was slave labour.In May 2017, FIFA president Gianni Infantino admitted there had been human rights abuses of North Korean workers involved in the construction of Saint Petersburg\'s Zenit Arena.By June 2017, at least 17 workers had died on World Cup construction sites, according to Building and Wood Workers\' International.In August, a group of eight US senators called on FIFA to consider dismissing Russia as the World Cup host if an independent investigation verified allegations of North Koreans being subjected to forced labor.\n\nRacism and Neo-nazi symbols displayed in the past by some Russian football fans drew criticism, with documented incidents of racial chants, banners spewing hate-filled messages, and sometimes assaults on people from the Caucasus and Central Asia.In March 2015, FIFA\'s then Vice President Jeffrey Webb said that Russia posed a huge challenge from a racism standpoint, and that a World Cup could not be held there under the current conditions.On July, United Nations anti-discrimination official Yuri Boychenko said that Russian soccer authorities had failed to fully grasp what racism was and needed to do more to combat it.To address this as well as concerns of hooliganism in general, Russian intelligence services blacklisted over 400 fans from entering the stadiums by June 2018, with 32 other countries also sending officers to help local police screen attendees for valid ID cards.\n\nAllegations of corruption in the bidding processes and concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups led to threats from England\'s FA to boycott the tournament.They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and Sepp Blatter had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.FIFA appointed Michael J. Garcia, a US attorney, to investigate and produce a report on the corruption allegations.Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert.Eckert\'s summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert\'s absolving Russia from blame.Greg Dyke called for a re-examination of the affair and David Bernstein called for a boycott of the World Cup.Garcia criticised the summary as being ""materially incomplete"" with ""erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions"", and appealed to FIFA\'s Appeal Committee.The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned to protest of FIFA\'s conduct, citing a ""lack of leadership"" and lack of confidence in Eckert\'s independence.\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the FBI confirmed that federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.In an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA\'s Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that ""should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled"".Prince William of Wales and former British Prime Minister David Cameron attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in England was discussed.\n\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations—the 209 FIFA member associations except automatically qualified hosts Russia—applied to enter the qualifying process.Zimbabwe and Indonesia were later disqualified before playing their first matches, while Gibraltar and Kosovo, who joined FIFA on 13 May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.The first qualification game, between Timor-Leste and Mongolia, began in Dili on 12 March 2015 as part of the AFC\'s qualification, and the main qualifying draw took place at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, on 25 July 2015.\n\nOf the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2014.Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the smallest country in terms of population to reach the World Cup.Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments included: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, who last appeared in 1982; Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002.Poland, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Sweden have also returned after 12 years.It was the first time three Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four Arab nations (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.\n\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions Italy (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden and were the highest-ranked team to not qualify; and the Netherlands, who were three-time runners-up and had finished in third place in 2014, had qualified for the last three World Cups, and failed to qualify for their second major tournament in a row, missing out on the UEFA Euro 2016 as well.Four reigning continental champions: 2017 Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon; two-time Copa América champions and 2017 Confederations Cup runners-up Chile; 2016 OFC Nations Cup winners New Zealand; and 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup champions the United States (for the first time since 1986) also failed to qualify.The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Ghana and Ivory Coast, both of which had qualified for the three previous tournaments.The lowest-ranked team to qualify was the host nation, Russia.\n\nNote: Numbers in parentheses indicate positions in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the tournament.\n\nAFC (5) (36) (37) (61) (67) (57)\n\nCAF (5) (45) (41) (48) (27) (21)\n\nCONCACAF (3) (23) (15) (55)\n\nCONMEBOL (5) (5) (2) (16) (11) (14)\n\nOFC (0) None qualified\n\nUEFA (14) (3) (20) (joint 12) (joint 12) (7) (1) (22) (8) (4) (70) (hosts) (34) (10) (24) (6)\n\nThe draw was held on 1 December 2017 at 18:00 MSK at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow.The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, by selecting one team from each of the four ranked pots.\n\nFor the draw, the teams were allocated to four pots based entirely on the FIFA World Rankings of October 2017.Pot one contained the hosts Russia (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams.Pot two contained the next best eight teams, and so on for pots three and four.This was different from previous draws, when only pot one was based on FIFA rankings while the remaining pots were based on geographical considerations.However, teams from the same confederation still were not drawn against each other for the group stage, except that two UEFA teams could be in each group.The pots for the draw are shown below.\n\nInitially, each team had to name a preliminary squad of 30 players, but in February 2018 this was increased to 35.From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 23 players (three of whom had to be goalkeepers) by 4 June.Players in the final squad could be replaced for serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team\'s first match.These replacements did not need to have been named in the preliminary squad.\n\nFor players named in the 35-player preliminary squad, there was a mandatory rest period between 21 and 27 May 2018, except for those involved in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final played on 26 May.\n\nOn 29 March 2018, FIFA released the list of 36 referees and 63 assistant referees selected to oversee matches.On 30 April 2018, FIFA released the list of 13 video assistant referees, who acted solely in this capacity in the tournament.\n\nReferee Fahad Al-Mirdasi of Saudi Arabia was removed on 30 May 2018 over a match-fixing attempt, along with his two assistant referees, compatriots Mohammed Al-Abakry and Abdulah Al-Shalwai.A new referee was not appointed, but two assistant referees, Hasan Al Mahri of the United Arab Emirates and Hiroshi Yamauchi of Japan, were added to the list.Assistant referee Marwa Range of Kenya also withdrew after the BBC released an investigation conducted by a Ghanaian journalist which implicated him in a bribery scandal.\n\nShortly after the International Football Association Board\'s decision to incorporate video assistant referees (VARs) into the Laws of the game (LOTG) on 16 March 2018, the FIFA Council took the much-anticipated step of approving the use of VAR for the first time in a FIFA World Cup tournament.\n\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees.Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums\' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.\n\nVAR had a significant impact on several games.On 15 June 2018, Diego Costa\'s first goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision; the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16 June and resulted in a goal by Antoine Griezmann.A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, a phenomenon partially attributed to VAR.Overall, the new technology was both praised and criticised by commentators.FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.\n\nRussia proposed the following host cities: Kaliningrad, Kazan, Krasnodar, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg, Samara, Saransk, Sochi, Volgograd, Yaroslavl, and Yekaterinburg.Each chosen city was located in European Russia (except Yekaterinburg, which is located in Asia but lies very close to the Europe-Asia border) in order to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country.The bid evaluation report stated: ""The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA\'s minimum requirement.Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.""\n\nIn October 2011, Russia reduced the number of stadiums from 16 to 14.Construction of the proposed Podolsk stadium in the Moscow Oblast was cancelled by the regional government.Also, in the capital, Otkritie Arena was competing with Dynamo Stadium over which would be constructed first.\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29 September 2012.The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list.Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8 billion was spent on hosting the tournament.\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.He also said, ""We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums in South Africa, where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums"".\n\nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA\'s inspection committee and its head, Chris Unger, visited St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues.They were satisfied with the progress.On 8 October 2015, FIFA and the local organising committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums to be used during the tournament.Of the twelve venues, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium—the two largest stadiums in Russia—were used most; both hosted seven matches.Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara each hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Otkritie Stadium in Moscow and the Rostov Stadium hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each.Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk each hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\n\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Between 2010 (when Russia were announced as hosts) and 2018, nine of the twelve stadiums were built (some in place of older, outdated venues) and the other three were renovated for the tournament.Kaliningrad: Kaliningrad Stadium (new).The first piles were driven into the ground in September 2015.On 11 April 2018 it hosted its first match.Kazan: Kazan Arena (new).The stadium was built for the 2013 Summer Universiade.It has since hosted the 2015 World Aquatics Championships and the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup.It serves as a home arena for FC Rubin Kazan.Moscow: Luzhniki Stadium (heavily renovated).The largest stadium in the country, it was closed for renovation in 2013.It was commissioned in November 2017.Moscow: Spartak Stadium (new).This stadium is the home arena to its namesake FC Spartak Moscow.In accordance with FIFA requirements, during the 2018 World Cup, it was called Spartak Stadium instead of its usual name Otkritie Arena.It hosted its first match on 5 September 2014.Nizhny Novgorod: Nizhny Novgorod Stadium (new).Construction of this stadium commenced in 2015 and was completed in December 2017.Rostov-on-Don: Rostov Arena (new).The stadium is located on the left bank of the Don.Construction was completed on 22 December 2017.Saint Petersburg: Saint Petersburg Stadium (new).Construction commenced in 2007 after the site, formerly occupied by Kirov Stadium, was cleared.The project was officially completed on 29 December 2016.It has hosted 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup games and served as a venue for UEFA Euro 2020.Samara: Samara Arena (new).Construction officially started on 21 July 2014 and was completed on 21 April 2018.Saransk: Mordovia Arena (new).The stadium in Saransk was scheduled to be commissioned in 2012 in time for the opening of the all-Russian Spartakiad, but the plan was revised.The opening was rescheduled to 2017.The arena hosted its first match on 21 April 2018.Sochi: Fisht Stadium (slightly renovated).This stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics.Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup.Volgograd: Volgograd Arena (new).The main Volgograd arena was built on the demolished Central Stadium site, at the foot of the Mamayev Kurgan memorial complex.It was commissioned on 3 April 2018.Yekaterinburg: Ekaterinburg Arena (heavily renovated).The Central Stadium of Yekaterinburg had been renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Its stands have a capacity of 35,000 spectators.The renovation project was completed in December 2017.\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament.On 9 February 2018, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team.\n\nArgentina: Bronnitsy, Moscow Oblast Australia: Kazan, Tatarstan Belgium: Krasnogorsky, Moscow Oblast Brazil: Sochi, Krasnodar Krai Colombia: Verkhneuslonsky, Tatarstan Costa Rica: Saint Petersburg Croatia: Roshchino, Leningrad Oblast Denmark: Anapa,

over $14.2 billion , the 2018 FIFA event was the most expensive World Cup in history, surpassing the $11.6 billion cost of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.\n\nThe Russian government had originally earmarked a budget of around $20 billion, which was later slashed to $10 billion, for World Cup preparations.Half was spent on transportation infrastructure.As part of the program to prepare for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a federal sub-program—""Construction and Renovation of Transport Infrastructure""—was implemented with a total budget of ₽352.5 billion (rubles), with ₽170.3 billion coming from the federal budget, ₽35.1 billion from regional budgets, and ₽147.1 billion from investors.The biggest item of federal spending was the aviation infrastructure costing ₽117.8 billion.Construction of new hotels was a crucial area of infrastructure development in World Cup host cities.Costs continued to mount as preparations were underway.\n\nPlatov International Airport in Rostov-on-Don was upgraded with automated air traffic control systems.Modern surveillance, navigation, communication, control, and meteorological support systems were also installed.Koltsovo Airport in Yekaterinburg was upgraded with radio-engineering tools for flight operation and received a second runway.Saransk Airport received a new navigation system; two new hotels were constructed in the city—the Mercure Saransk Centre (Accor Hotels) and Four Points by Sheraton Saransk as well as few other smaller accommodation facilities.In Samara, new tram lines were laid.Khrabrovo Airport in Kaliningrad was upgraded with radio navigation and weather equipment.Renovation and upgraded radio-engineering tools for flight operations was completed in the Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Volgograd, Samara, Yekaterinburg, Kazan and Sochi airports.On 27 March, the Russian Ministry of Construction Industry, Housing and Utilities Sector of reported that all communications within its area of responsibility had been commissioned.The last facility commissioned was a waste treatment station in Volgograd.In Yekaterinburg, where four matches were hosted, hosting costs increased to over ₽7.4 billion, exceeding the ₽5.6 billion rubles originally allocated from the state and regional budget.\n\nVolunteer applications to the 2018 Russia Local Organising Committee opened on 1 June 2016.The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Volunteer Program received about 177,000 applications, and engaged a total of 35,000 volunteers.They received training at 15 Volunteer Centres of the local organising committee based in 15 universities, and in volunteer centres in the host cities.Preference, especially in key areas, was given to those with knowledge of a foreign language and volunteering experience, but not necessarily to Russian nationals.\n\nFree public transport services were offered for ticketholders during the World Cup, including additional trains linking host cities, as well as services such as bus services within them.\n\nThe full schedule was announced by FIFA on 24 July 2015 without kick-off times, which were confirmed later.On 1 December 2017, following the final draw, FIFA adjusted six kick-off times.\n\nRussia was placed in position A1 in the group stage and played in the opening match at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on 14 June against Saudi Arabia, the two lowest-ranked teams of the tournament at the time of the final draw.The Luzhniki Stadium also hosted the second semi-final on 11 July and the final on 15 July.The Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg hosted the first semi-final on 10 July and the third place play-off on 14 July.\n\nThe opening ceremony took place on Thursday, 14 June 2018, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, preceding the opening match of the tournament between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia.\n\nAt the start of the ceremony, Russian president Vladimir Putin gave a speech, welcoming the countries of the world to Russia and calling football a uniting force.Brazilian World Cup-winning striker Ronaldo entered the stadium with a child in a Russia jersey.Pop singer Robbie Williams then sang two of his songs solo before he and Russian soprano Aida Garifullina performed a duet.Dancers dressed in the flags of the 32 competing teams appeared carrying a sign with the name of each nation.At the end of the ceremony Ronaldo reappeared with the official match ball which had returned from the International Space Station in early June.\n\nYoung participants of the international children\'s social programme Football for Friendship from 211 countries and regions took part in the opening ceremony of the FIFA World Cup at the Luzhniki stadium.\n\nCompeting countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H).Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage.Ten European teams and four South American teams progressed to the knockout stage, together with Japan and Mexico.\n\nFor the first time since 1938, Germany, the reigning champions, were eliminated in the first round.This was the third consecutive tournament in which the holders were eliminated in the first round, after Italy in 2010 and Spain in 2014.No African team progressed to the second round for the first time since 1982.The fair play criteria came into use for the first time when Japan qualified over Senegal because the team had received fewer yellow cards.Only one match, France versus Denmark, was goalless.Until then there were a record 36 straight games in which at least one goal was scored.All times listed below are local time.\n\nIn the knockout stages, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winners.If a match went into extra time, each team was allowed to make a fourth substitution, the first time this had been allowed in a FIFA World Cup tournament.Below is the bracket for the knockout round of the tournament, teams in bold denote match winners.\n\nIn total, only four players were sent off in the entire tournament, the fewest since 1978.International Football Association Board technical director David Elleray stated a belief that this was due to the introduction of VAR, since players would know that they would not be able to get away with anything under the new system.\n\nA player is automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences: Receiving a red card (red card suspensions may be extended for serious offences)Receiving two yellow cards in two matches; yellow cards expire after the completion of the quarter-finals (yellow card suspensions are not carried forward to any other future international matches)\n\nThe following suspensions were served during the tournament:\n\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament.The Golden Boot (top scorer), Golden Ball (best overall player) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper) awards were all sponsored by Adidas.\n\nThe users of FIFA.com elected their Fan Dream Team.\n\nAdditionally, FIFA.com shortlisted 18 goals for users to vote on as the tournament\'s best.The poll closed on 23 July.The award was sponsored by Hyundai.\n\nFIFA published an All-Star Team, this year called the Fantasy Team, based on player performances evaluated through statistical data.\n\nPrize money amounts were announced in October 2017.\n\nThe tournament logo was unveiled on 28 October 2014 by cosmonauts at the International Space Station and then projected onto Moscow\'s Bolshoi Theatre during an evening television programme.Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said the logo was inspired by ""Russia\'s rich artistic tradition and its history of bold achievement and innovation"", and FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that it reflected the ""heart and soul"" of the country.For branding, Portuguese design agency Brandia Central created materials in 2014, with a typeface called Dusha – – designed by Brandia Central and edited by Adotbelow of the DSType Foundry in Portugal.\n\nThe first phase of ticket sales started on 14 September 2017, 12:00 Moscow Time, and lasted until 12 October 2017.\n\nThe general visa policy of Russia did not apply to participants and spectators, who were able to visit Russia without a visa right before and during the competition regardless of their citizenship.Spectators were nonetheless required to register for a ""Fan-ID"", a special photo identification pass.A Fan-ID was required to enter the country visa-free, while a ticket, Fan-ID and a valid passport were required to enter stadiums for matches.Fan-IDs also granted World Cup attendees free access to public transport services, including buses, and train service between host cities.Fan-ID was administered by the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, which could revoke this accreditation at any time to ""ensure the defence capability or security of the state or public order"".\n\nOn 29 May 2018, Electronic Arts released a free update to their video game FIFA 18 that added content related to the 2018 FIFA World Cup.The expansion included a World Cup tournament mode with all teams and stadiums from the event, official television presentation elements, and World Cup-related content for the Ultimate Team mode.\n\nPanini continued their partnership with FIFA by producing stickers for their World Cup sticker album.Panini also developed an app for the 2018 World Cup where fans could collect and swap virtual stickers, with 5 million fans gathering digital stickers for the tournament.\n\nThe tournament\'s official mascot was unveiled on 21 October 2016, and selected through a design competition among university students.A public vote was used to select the mascot from three finalists—a cat, a tiger, and a wolf.The winner, with 53% or approximately 1 million votes, was Zabivaka—an anthropomorphic wolf dressed in the colours of the Russian national team.Zabivaka\'s name is a portmanteau of the Russian words забияка (""hothead"") and забивать (""to score""), and his official backstory states that he is an aspiring football player who is ""charming, confident and social"".\n\nThe official match ball, the ""Telstar 18"", was unveiled on 9 November 2017.It was based on the name and design of the first Adidas World Cup ball from 1970.A special red-coloured variation, ""Telstar Mechta"", was used for the knockout stage of the tournament.The word mechta (Russian: мечта) means ""dream"" or ""ambition"".\n\nGoalkeepers noted that the ball was slippery and prone to having unpredictable trajectory.In addition, two Telstar 18 balls popped in the midst of a first-round match between France and Australia, leading to further discussions over the ball\'s performance.\n\nThe official song of the tournament was ""Live It Up"", with vocals by Will Smith, Nicky Jam and Era Istrefi, released on 25 May 2018.Its music video was released on 8 June 2018.\n\nThirty-three footballers who were alleged to be part of the Russian steroid programme are listed in the McLaren Report.On 22 December 2017, it was reported that FIFA had fired a doctor who had been investigating doping in Russian football.On 22 May 2018, FIFA stated that the investigations concerning all Russian players named for the provisional squad of the FIFA World Cup in Russia had been completed, with the result that insufficient evidence was found to support anti-doping rule violations.FIFA\'s medical committee also decided that Russian personnel would not be involved in performing drug testing procedures at the tournament, an action taken to reassure teams that samples would not be tampered with.\n\nRussia relaxed its visa rules during the World Cup, allowing Fan ID holders to enter and exit Russia without a visa through 31 December 2018.Traffickers exploited this system to bring foreign sex trafficking victims into the country, especially from Nigeria.Reuters had raised concerns about the victims\' conditions, who had allegedly been forced into prostitution, with some of them enduring violent abuse.Russian authorities were accused of doing little to fix to the issue, allegedly because many locals blamed the victims for falling into prostitution.\n\nIn response to the March 2018 poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, British prime minister Theresa May announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans.Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that the West are trying to ""take the World Cup out of Russia"".The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced Boris Johnson\'s statements that compared the event to the 1936 Olympics held in Nazi Germany as ""poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness"" and ""unacceptable and unworthy"" parallel towards Russia, a ""nation that lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism"".\n\nAt the close of the World Cup, Russia was widely praised for its success in hosting the tournament, with Steve Rosenberg of the BBC deeming it ""a resounding public relations success"" for Putin, adding: ""The stunning new stadiums, free train travel to venues and the absence of crowd violence has impressed visiting supporters.Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country\'s authoritarian image.All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised.""\n\nDespite the British Foreign Office and MPs repeatedly warning English football fans travelling to Russia of ""racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility"", fans who did travel said they received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino stated: ""Everyone discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, that is keen to show the world that everything that has been said before might not be true.A lot of preconceived ideas have been changed because people have seen the true nature of Russia.""Infantino has proclaimed Russia 2018 to be ""the best World Cup ever.""98 percent of the stadiums were sold out, there were 3 billion viewers on TV around the world and 7 million fans visited the fan fests.It was the most viewed World Cup to date, and the third most viewed television broadcast, surpassing the Beijing Olympics in 2008.\n\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters.After having tested the technology at limited matches of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the 2014 FIFA World Cup (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of Rio de Janeiro), the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in 4K ultra high definition.Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut of each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being converted up from 1080p high definition sources with limited degradation in quality.These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder UA:PBC stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup due to existing tensions with Russia amidst the Russo-Ukrainian War.This came in the wake of growing boycott of the tournament by the Football Federation of Ukraine and sports minister Ihor Zhdanov.Additionally, the FFU refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing diplomatic crisis in Qatar, which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar—the home country of FIFA\'s Middle East and Africa rightsholder beIN Sports—in June 2017, over its alleged state support of terrorist groups.On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from Du and Etisalat, but with service to the latter restored later that day.Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as ""beoutQ"".While FIFA attempted to negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final indirectly, they were unable to do so.On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had ""engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.""\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men\'s World Cup whose English rights were held by Fox Sports, and Spanish rights held by Telemundo.The elimination of the United States in the qualifiers led to concerns that U.S. interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that ""casual"" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5 million in 2014, and determined how much Fox paid for the rights.During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among Hispanic and Latino Americans.Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of tournament coverage.Viewership was down overall compared to 2014; match scheduling and time zones were not as favourable to viewers in the Americas as they were in 2014.Many games aired in the morning hours, although Telemundo\'s broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday daytime program in the network\'s history.\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, Korean Central Television acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea.Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time.In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to strained relations and campaigns against the country.\n\nA combined 3.572 billion unique viewers (live global 1-minute reach) – more than half of the global population aged four and over – tuned in to world football\'s ultimate competition, according to audience data for official broadcast coverage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe average global live audience for every game of the tournament was 191 million viewers (for a cumulative live audience of 12.224 billion viewers), a 2.1% increase over the 2014 tournament average of 187 million viewers, including that average audience in the early stages (group stage and round of 16) were bigger than in 2014.However, in 2018, the audience was 15 percent smaller for the semi-finals, 17 percent for the third place play-off, and 5.1 percent for the final, which was watched by 517 million people on average (only in-home TV viewers), compared to 545 million in 2014.Presumably, the reason for that is the smaller countries involved in the top four games compared to those in 2014, and only one global region (Europe) being represented in 2018 (compared to South America and Europe in 2014).However the live global 1-minute reach of the final was 1.12 billion people (884.37 in-home TV viewers and 231.82 million out-of-home and (or) digital-only viewers).\n\nFIFA World Cup FIFA World Cup hosts 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup 2019 FIFA Women\'s World Cup\n', 'Claim_Context': ""Croatian player Luka Modrić

5,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018 FIFA World Cup', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The 2018 FIFA World Cup was the 21st FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for national football teams organized by FIFA.It took place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in late 2010.It was the eleventh time the championships had been held in Europe, the first time they were held in Eastern Europe, and the first time they were held across two continents (Europe and Asia).At an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion, it was the most expensive World Cup ever held until it was surpassed by the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nThe tournament phase involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through qualifying competitions, while the host nation Russia qualified automatically.Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the 2014 event, while Iceland and Panama each made their debut at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities.Germany, the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage for the first time since 1938.Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals.In the final, France played Croatia on 15 July at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.France won the match 4–2, claiming their second World Cup and becoming the fourth consecutive title won by a European team, after Italy in 2006, Spain in 2010, and Germany in 2014.\n\nCroatian player Luka Modrić was voted the tournament\'s best player, winning the Golden Ball.England\'s Harry Kane won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals during the tournament with six.Belgium\'s Thibaut Courtois won the Golden Glove, awarded to the goalkeeper with the best performance.It has been estimated that more than 3 million people attended games during the tournament.\n\nThe bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest.Initially, nine countries placed bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico later withdrew from the proceedings, and Indonesia\'s bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian government failed to submit a letter to support the bid.During the bidding process, the three remaining non-UEFA nations (Australia, Japan, and the United States) gradually withdrew from the 2018 bids, and thus all UEFA nations were ruled out of the 2022 bid.As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.\n\nThe 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting.The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third.England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.\n\nThe voting results were:\n\nThe choice of Russia as host was controversial.Issues included the high level of racism in Russian football, human rights abuses by Russian authorities, and discrimination against LGBT people in government (including gay propaganda laws) along with wider Russian society.Russia\'s involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine had also prompted calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the annexation of Crimea.In 2014, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that ""the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work"".\n\nRussia was criticised for alleged abuse of migrant labourers in the construction of World Cup venues, with Human Rights Watch reporting cases where workers were left unpaid, made to work in dangerously cold conditions, or suffering reprisals for raising concerns.A few pundits claimed it was slave labour.In May 2017, FIFA president Gianni Infantino admitted there had been human rights abuses of North Korean workers involved in the construction of Saint Petersburg\'s Zenit Arena.By June 2017, at least 17 workers had died on World Cup construction sites, according to Building and Wood Workers\' International.In August, a group of eight US senators called on FIFA to consider dismissing Russia as the World Cup host if an independent investigation verified allegations of North Koreans being subjected to forced labor.\n\nRacism and Neo-nazi symbols displayed in the past by some Russian football fans drew criticism, with documented incidents of racial chants, banners spewing hate-filled messages, and sometimes assaults on people from the Caucasus and Central Asia.In March 2015, FIFA\'s then Vice President Jeffrey Webb said that Russia posed a huge challenge from a racism standpoint, and that a World Cup could not be held there under the current conditions.On July, United Nations anti-discrimination official Yuri Boychenko said that Russian soccer authorities had failed to fully grasp what racism was and needed to do more to combat it.To address this as well as concerns of hooliganism in general, Russian intelligence services blacklisted over 400 fans from entering the stadiums by June 2018, with 32 other countries also sending officers to help local police screen attendees for valid ID cards.\n\nAllegations of corruption in the bidding processes and concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups led to threats from England\'s FA to boycott the tournament.They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and Sepp Blatter had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.FIFA appointed Michael J. Garcia, a US attorney, to investigate and produce a report on the corruption allegations.Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert.Eckert\'s summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert\'s absolving Russia from blame.Greg Dyke called for a re-examination of the affair and David Bernstein called for a boycott of the World Cup.Garcia criticised the summary as being ""materially incomplete"" with ""erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions"", and appealed to FIFA\'s Appeal Committee.The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned to protest of FIFA\'s conduct, citing a ""lack of leadership"" and lack of confidence in Eckert\'s independence.\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the FBI confirmed that federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.In an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA\'s Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that ""should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled"".Prince William of Wales and former British Prime Minister David Cameron attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in England was discussed.\n\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations—the 209 FIFA member associations except automatically qualified hosts Russia—applied to enter the qualifying process.Zimbabwe and Indonesia were later disqualified before playing their first matches, while Gibraltar and Kosovo, who joined FIFA on 13 May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.The first qualification game, between Timor-Leste and Mongolia, began in Dili on 12 March 2015 as part of the AFC\'s qualification, and the main qualifying draw took place at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, on 25 July 2015.\n\nOf the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2014.Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the smallest country in terms of population to reach the World Cup.Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments included: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, who last appeared in 1982; Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002.Poland, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Sweden have also returned after 12 years.It was the first time three Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four Arab nations (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.\n\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions Italy (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden and were the highest-ranked team to not qualify; and the Netherlands, who were three-time runners-up and had finished in third place in 2014, had qualified for the last three World Cups, and failed to qualify for their second major tournament in a row, missing out on the UEFA Euro 2016 as well.Four reigning continental champions: 2017 Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon; two-time Copa América champions and 2017 Confederations Cup runners-up Chile; 2016 OFC Nations Cup winners New Zealand; and 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup champions the United States (for the first time since 1986) also failed to qualify.The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Ghana and Ivory Coast, both of which had qualified for the three previous tournaments.The lowest-ranked team to qualify was the host nation, Russia.\n\nNote: Numbers in parentheses indicate positions in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the tournament.\n\nAFC (5) (36) (37) (61) (67) (57)\n\nCAF (5) (45) (41) (48) (27) (21)\n\nCONCACAF (3) (23) (15)

December 2017 at 18:00 MSK at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow.The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, by selecting one team from each of the four ranked pots.\n\nFor the draw, the teams were allocated to four pots based entirely on the FIFA World Rankings of October 2017.Pot one contained the hosts Russia (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams.Pot two contained the next best eight teams, and so on for pots three and four.This was different from previous draws, when only pot one was based on FIFA rankings while the remaining pots were based on geographical considerations.However, teams from the same confederation still were not drawn against each other for the group stage, except that two UEFA teams could be in each group.The pots for the draw are shown below.\n\nInitially, each team had to name a preliminary squad of 30 players, but in February 2018 this was increased to 35.From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 23 players (three of whom had to be goalkeepers) by 4 June.Players in the final squad could be replaced for serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team\'s first match.These replacements did not need to have been named in the preliminary squad.\n\nFor players named in the 35-player preliminary squad, there was a mandatory rest period between 21 and 27 May 2018, except for those involved in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final played on 26 May.\n\nOn 29 March 2018, FIFA released the list of 36 referees and 63 assistant referees selected to oversee matches.On 30 April 2018, FIFA released the list of 13 video assistant referees, who acted solely in this capacity in the tournament.\n\nReferee Fahad Al-Mirdasi of Saudi Arabia was removed on 30 May 2018 over a match-fixing attempt, along with his two assistant referees, compatriots Mohammed Al-Abakry and Abdulah Al-Shalwai.A new referee was not appointed, but two assistant referees, Hasan Al Mahri of the United Arab Emirates and Hiroshi Yamauchi of Japan, were added to the list.Assistant referee Marwa Range of Kenya also withdrew after the BBC released an investigation conducted by a Ghanaian journalist which implicated him in a bribery scandal.\n\nShortly after the International Football Association Board\'s decision to incorporate video assistant referees (VARs) into the Laws of the game (LOTG) on 16 March 2018, the FIFA Council took the much-anticipated step of approving the use of VAR for the first time in a FIFA World Cup tournament.\n\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees.Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums\' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.\n\nVAR had a significant impact on several games.On 15 June 2018, Diego Costa\'s first goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision; the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16 June and resulted in a goal by Antoine Griezmann.A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, a phenomenon partially attributed to VAR.Overall, the new technology was both praised and criticised by commentators.FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.\n\nRussia proposed the following host cities: Kaliningrad, Kazan, Krasnodar, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg, Samara, Saransk, Sochi, Volgograd, Yaroslavl, and Yekaterinburg.Each chosen city was located in European Russia (except Yekaterinburg, which is located in Asia but lies very close to the Europe-Asia border) in order to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country.The bid evaluation report stated: ""The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA\'s minimum requirement.Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.""\n\nIn October 2011, Russia reduced the number of stadiums from 16 to 14.Construction of the proposed Podolsk stadium in the Moscow Oblast was cancelled by the regional government.Also, in the capital, Otkritie Arena was competing with Dynamo Stadium over which would be constructed first.\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29 September 2012.The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list.Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8 billion was spent on hosting the tournament.\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.He also said, ""We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums in South Africa, where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums"".\n\nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA\'s inspection committee and its head, Chris Unger, visited St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues.They were satisfied with the progress.On 8 October 2015, FIFA and the local organising committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums to be used during the tournament.Of the twelve venues, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium—the two largest stadiums in Russia—were used most; both hosted seven matches.Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara each hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Otkritie Stadium in Moscow and the Rostov Stadium hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each.Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk each hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\n\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Between 2010 (when Russia were announced as hosts) and 2018, nine of the twelve stadiums were built (some in place of older, outdated venues) and the other three were renovated for the tournament.Kaliningrad: Kaliningrad Stadium (new).The first piles were driven into the ground in September 2015.On 11 April 2018 it hosted its first match.Kazan: Kazan Arena (new).The stadium was built for the 2013 Summer Universiade.It has since hosted the 2015 World Aquatics Championships and the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup.It serves as a home arena for FC Rubin Kazan.Moscow: Luzhniki Stadium (heavily renovated).The largest stadium in the country, it was closed for renovation in 2013.It was commissioned in November 2017.Moscow: Spartak Stadium (new).This stadium is the home arena to its namesake FC Spartak Moscow.In accordance with FIFA requirements, during the 2018 World Cup, it was called Spartak Stadium instead of its usual name Otkritie Arena.It hosted its first match on 5 September 2014.Nizhny Novgorod: Nizhny Novgorod Stadium (new).Construction of this stadium commenced in 2015 and was completed in December 2017.Rostov-on-Don: Rostov Arena (new).The stadium is located on the left bank of the Don.Construction was completed on 22 December 2017.Saint Petersburg: Saint Petersburg Stadium (new).Construction commenced in 2007 after the site, formerly occupied by Kirov Stadium, was cleared.The project was officially completed on 29 December 2016.It has hosted 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup games and served as a venue for UEFA Euro 2020.Samara: Samara Arena (new).Construction officially started on 21 July 2014 and was completed on 21 April 2018.Saransk: Mordovia Arena (new).The stadium in Saransk was scheduled to be commissioned in 2012 in time for the opening of the all-Russian Spartakiad, but the plan was revised.The opening was rescheduled to 2017.The arena hosted its first match on 21 April 2018.Sochi: Fisht Stadium (slightly renovated).This stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics.Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup.Volgograd: Volgograd Arena (new).The main Volgograd arena was built on the demolished Central Stadium site, at the foot of the Mamayev Kurgan memorial complex.It was commissioned on 3 April 2018.Yekaterinburg: Ekaterinburg Arena (heavily renovated).The Central Stadium of Yekaterinburg had been renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Its stands have a capacity of 35,000 spectators.The renovation project was completed in December 2017.\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament.On 9 February 2018, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team.\n\nArgentina: Bronnitsy, Moscow Oblast Australia: Kazan, Tatarstan Belgium: Krasnogorsky, Moscow Oblast Brazil: Sochi, Krasnodar Krai Colombia: Verkhneuslonsky, Tatarstan Costa Rica: Saint Petersburg Croatia: Roshchino, Leningrad Oblast Denmark: Anapa,

over $14.2 billion , the 2018 FIFA event was the most expensive World Cup in history, surpassing the $11.6 billion cost of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.\n\nThe Russian government had originally earmarked a budget of around $20 billion, which was later slashed to $10 billion, for World Cup preparations.Half was spent on transportation infrastructure.As part of the program to prepare for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a federal sub-program—""Construction and Renovation of Transport Infrastructure""—was implemented with a total budget of ₽352.5 billion (rubles), with ₽170.3 billion coming from the federal budget, ₽35.1 billion from regional budgets, and ₽147.1 billion from investors.The biggest item of federal spending was the aviation infrastructure costing ₽117.8 billion.Construction of new hotels was a crucial area of infrastructure development in World Cup host cities.Costs continued to mount as preparations were underway.\n\nPlatov International Airport in Rostov-on-Don was upgraded with automated air traffic control systems.Modern surveillance, navigation, communication, control, and meteorological support systems were also installed.Koltsovo Airport in Yekaterinburg was upgraded with radio-engineering tools for flight operation and received a second runway.Saransk Airport received a new navigation system; two new hotels were constructed in the city—the Mercure Saransk Centre (Accor Hotels) and Four Points by Sheraton Saransk as well as few other smaller accommodation facilities.In Samara, new tram lines were laid.Khrabrovo Airport in Kaliningrad was upgraded with radio navigation and weather equipment.Renovation and upgraded radio-engineering tools for flight operations was completed in the Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Volgograd, Samara, Yekaterinburg, Kazan and Sochi airports.On 27 March, the Russian Ministry of Construction Industry, Housing and Utilities Sector of reported that all communications within its area of responsibility had been commissioned.The last facility commissioned was a waste treatment station in Volgograd.In Yekaterinburg, where four matches were hosted, hosting costs increased to over ₽7.4 billion, exceeding the ₽5.6 billion rubles originally allocated from the state and regional budget.\n\nVolunteer applications to the 2018 Russia Local Organising Committee opened on 1 June 2016.The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Volunteer Program received about 177,000 applications, and engaged a total of 35,000 volunteers.They received training at 15 Volunteer Centres of the local organising committee based in 15 universities, and in volunteer centres in the host cities.Preference, especially in key areas, was given to those with knowledge of a foreign language and volunteering experience, but not necessarily to Russian nationals.\n\nFree public transport services were offered for ticketholders during the World Cup, including additional trains linking host cities, as well as services such as bus services within them.\n\nThe full schedule was announced by FIFA on 24 July 2015 without kick-off times, which were confirmed later.On 1 December 2017, following the final draw, FIFA adjusted six kick-off times.\n\nRussia was placed in position A1 in the group stage and played in the opening match at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on 14 June against Saudi Arabia, the two lowest-ranked teams of the tournament at the time of the final draw.The Luzhniki Stadium also hosted the second semi-final on 11 July and the final on 15 July.The Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg hosted the first semi-final on 10 July and the third place play-off on 14 July.\n\nThe opening ceremony took place on Thursday, 14 June 2018, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, preceding the opening match of the tournament between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia.\n\nAt the start of the ceremony, Russian president Vladimir Putin gave a speech, welcoming the countries of the world to Russia and calling football a uniting force.Brazilian World Cup-winning striker Ronaldo entered the stadium with a child in a Russia jersey.Pop singer Robbie Williams then sang two of his songs solo before he and Russian soprano Aida Garifullina performed a duet.Dancers dressed in the flags of the 32 competing teams appeared carrying a sign with the name of each nation.At the end of the ceremony Ronaldo reappeared with the official match ball which had returned from the International Space Station in early June.\n\nYoung participants of the international children\'s social programme Football for Friendship from 211 countries and regions took part in the opening ceremony of the FIFA World Cup at the Luzhniki stadium.\n\nCompeting countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H).Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage.Ten European teams and four South American teams progressed to the knockout stage, together with Japan and Mexico.\n\nFor the first time since 1938, Germany, the reigning champions, were eliminated in the first round.This was the third consecutive tournament in which the holders were eliminated in the first round, after Italy in 2010 and Spain in 2014.No African team progressed to the second round for the first time since 1982.The fair play criteria came into use for the first time when Japan qualified over Senegal because the team had received fewer yellow cards.Only one match, France versus Denmark, was goalless.Until then there were a record 36 straight games in which at least one goal was scored.All times listed below are local time.\n\nIn the knockout stages, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winners.If a match went into extra time, each team was allowed to make a fourth substitution, the first time this had been allowed in a FIFA World Cup tournament.Below is the bracket for the knockout round of the tournament, teams in bold denote match winners.\n\nIn total, only four players were sent off in the entire tournament, the fewest since 1978.International Football Association Board technical director David Elleray stated a belief that this was due to the introduction of VAR, since players would know that they would not be able to get away with anything under the new system.\n\nA player is automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences: Receiving a red card (red card suspensions may be extended for serious offences)Receiving two yellow cards in two matches; yellow cards expire after the completion of the quarter-finals (yellow card suspensions are not carried forward to any other future international matches)\n\nThe following suspensions were served during the tournament:\n\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament.The Golden Boot (top scorer), Golden Ball (best overall player) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper) awards were all sponsored by Adidas.\n\nThe users of FIFA.com elected their Fan Dream Team.\n\nAdditionally, FIFA.com shortlisted 18 goals for users to vote on as the tournament\'s best.The poll closed on 23 July.The award was sponsored by Hyundai.\n\nFIFA published an All-Star Team, this year called the Fantasy Team, based on player performances evaluated through statistical data.\n\nPrize money amounts were announced in October 2017.\n\nThe tournament logo was unveiled on 28 October 2014 by cosmonauts at the International Space Station and then projected onto Moscow\'s Bolshoi Theatre during an evening television programme.Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said the logo was inspired by ""Russia\'s rich artistic tradition and its history of bold achievement and innovation"", and FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that it reflected the ""heart and soul"" of the country.For branding, Portuguese design agency Brandia Central created materials in 2014, with a typeface called Dusha – – designed by Brandia Central and edited by Adotbelow of the DSType Foundry in Portugal.\n\nThe first phase of ticket sales started on 14 September 2017, 12:00 Moscow Time, and lasted until 12 October 2017.\n\nThe general visa policy of Russia did not apply to participants and spectators, who were able to visit Russia without a visa right before and during the competition regardless of their citizenship.Spectators were nonetheless required to register for a ""Fan-ID"", a special photo identification pass.A Fan-ID was required to enter the country visa-free, while a ticket, Fan-ID and a valid passport were required to enter stadiums for matches.Fan-IDs also granted World Cup attendees free access to public transport services, including buses, and train service between host cities.Fan-ID was administered by the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, which could revoke this accreditation at any time to ""ensure the defence capability or security of the state or public order"".\n\nOn 29 May 2018, Electronic Arts released a free update to their video game FIFA 18 that added content related to the 2018 FIFA World Cup.The expansion included a World Cup tournament mode with all teams and stadiums from the event, official television presentation elements, and World Cup-related content for the Ultimate Team mode.\n\nPanini continued their partnership with FIFA by producing stickers for their World Cup sticker album.Panini also developed an app for the 2018 World Cup where fans could collect and swap virtual stickers, with 5 million fans gathering digital stickers for the tournament.\n\nThe tournament\'s official mascot was unveiled on 21 October 2016, and selected through a design competition among university students.A public vote was used to select the mascot from three finalists—a cat, a tiger, and a wolf.The winner, with 53% or approximately 1 million votes, was Zabivaka—an anthropomorphic wolf dressed in the colours of the Russian national team.Zabivaka\'s name is a portmanteau of the Russian words забияка (""hothead"") and забивать (""to score""), and his official backstory states that he is an aspiring football player who is ""charming, confident and social"".\n\nThe official match ball, the ""Telstar 18"", was unveiled on 9 November 2017.It was based on the name and design of the first Adidas World Cup ball from 1970.A special red-coloured variation, ""Telstar Mechta"", was used for the knockout stage of the tournament.The word mechta (Russian: мечта) means ""dream"" or ""ambition"".\n\nGoalkeepers noted that the ball was slippery and prone to having unpredictable trajectory.In addition, two Telstar 18 balls popped in the midst of a first-round match between France and Australia, leading to further discussions over the ball\'s performance.\n\nThe official song of the tournament was ""Live It Up"", with vocals by Will Smith, Nicky Jam and Era Istrefi, released on 25 May 2018.Its music video was released on 8 June 2018.\n\nThirty-three footballers who were alleged to be part of the Russian steroid programme are listed in the McLaren Report.On 22 December 2017, it was reported that FIFA had fired a doctor who had been investigating doping in Russian football.On 22 May 2018, FIFA stated that the investigations concerning all Russian players named for the provisional squad of the FIFA World Cup in Russia had been completed, with the result that insufficient evidence was found to support anti-doping rule violations.FIFA\'s medical committee also decided that Russian personnel would not be involved in performing drug testing procedures at the tournament, an action taken to reassure teams that samples would not be tampered with.\n\nRussia relaxed its visa rules during the World Cup, allowing Fan ID holders to enter and exit Russia without a visa through 31 December 2018.Traffickers exploited this system to bring foreign sex trafficking victims into the country, especially from Nigeria.Reuters had raised concerns about the victims\' conditions, who had allegedly been forced into prostitution, with some of them enduring violent abuse.Russian authorities were accused of doing little to fix to the issue, allegedly because many locals blamed the victims for falling into prostitution.\n\nIn response to the March 2018 poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, British prime minister Theresa May announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans.Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that the West are trying to ""take the World Cup out of Russia"".The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced Boris Johnson\'s statements that compared the event to the 1936 Olympics held in Nazi Germany as ""poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness"" and ""unacceptable and unworthy"" parallel towards Russia, a ""nation that lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism"".\n\nAt the close of the World Cup, Russia was widely praised for its success in hosting the tournament, with Steve Rosenberg of the BBC deeming it ""a resounding public relations success"" for Putin, adding: ""The stunning new stadiums, free train travel to venues and the absence of crowd violence has impressed visiting supporters.Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country\'s authoritarian image.All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised.""\n\nDespite the British Foreign Office and MPs repeatedly warning English football fans travelling to Russia of ""racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility"", fans who did travel said they received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino stated: ""Everyone discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, that is keen to show the world that everything that has been said before might not be true.A lot of preconceived ideas have been changed because people have seen the true nature of Russia.""Infantino has proclaimed Russia 2018 to be ""the best World Cup ever.""98 percent of the stadiums were sold out, there were 3 billion viewers on TV around the world and 7 million fans visited the fan fests.It was the most viewed World Cup to date, and the third most viewed television broadcast, surpassing the Beijing Olympics in 2008.\n\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters.After having tested the technology at limited matches of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the 2014 FIFA World Cup (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of Rio de Janeiro), the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in 4K ultra high definition.Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut of each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being converted up from 1080p high definition sources with limited degradation in quality.These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder UA:PBC stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup due to existing tensions with Russia amidst the Russo-Ukrainian War.This came in the wake of growing boycott of the tournament by the Football Federation of Ukraine and sports minister Ihor Zhdanov.Additionally, the FFU refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing diplomatic crisis in Qatar, which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar—the home country of FIFA\'s Middle East and Africa rightsholder beIN Sports—in June 2017, over its alleged state support of terrorist groups.On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from Du and Etisalat, but with service to the latter restored later that day.Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as ""beoutQ"".While FIFA attempted to negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final indirectly, they were unable to do so.On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had ""engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.""\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men\'s World Cup whose English rights were held by Fox Sports, and Spanish rights held by Telemundo.The elimination of the United States in the qualifiers led to concerns that U.S. interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that ""casual"" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5 million in 2014, and determined how much Fox paid for the rights.During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among Hispanic and Latino Americans.Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of tournament coverage.Viewership was down overall compared to 2014; match scheduling and time zones were not as favourable to viewers in the Americas as they were in 2014.Many games aired in the morning hours, although Telemundo\'s broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday daytime program in the network\'s history.\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, Korean Central Television acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea.Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time.In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to strained relations and campaigns against the country.\n\nA combined 3.572 billion unique viewers (live global 1-minute reach) – more than half of the global population aged four and over – tuned in to world football\'s ultimate competition, according to audience data for official broadcast coverage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe average global live audience for every game of the tournament was 191 million viewers (for a cumulative live audience of 12.224 billion viewers), a 2.1% increase over the 2014 tournament average of 187 million viewers, including that average audience in the early stages (group stage and round of 16) were bigger than in 2014.However, in 2018, the audience was 15 percent smaller for the semi-finals, 17 percent for the third place play-off, and 5.1 percent for the final, which was watched by 517 million people on average (only in-home TV viewers), compared to 545 million in 2014.Presumably, the reason for that is the smaller countries involved in the top four games compared to those in 2014, and only one global region (Europe) being represented in 2018 (compared to South America and Europe in 2014).However the live global 1-minute reach of the final was 1.12 billion people (884.37 in-home TV viewers and 231.82 million out-of-home and (or) digital-only viewers).\n\nFIFA World Cup FIFA World Cup hosts 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup 2019 FIFA Women\'s World Cup\n', 'Claim_Context': ""Croatian player Luka Modrić

6,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018 FIFA World Cup', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The 2018 FIFA World Cup was the 21st FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for national football teams organized by FIFA.It took place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in late 2010.It was the eleventh time the championships had been held in Europe, the first time they were held in Eastern Europe, and the first time they were held across two continents (Europe and Asia).At an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion, it was the most expensive World Cup ever held until it was surpassed by the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nThe tournament phase involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through qualifying competitions, while the host nation Russia qualified automatically.Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the 2014 event, while Iceland and Panama each made their debut at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities.Germany, the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage for the first time since 1938.Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals.In the final, France played Croatia on 15 July at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.France won the match 4–2, claiming their second World Cup and becoming the fourth consecutive title won by a European team, after Italy in 2006, Spain in 2010, and Germany in 2014.\n\nCroatian player Luka Modrić was voted the tournament\'s best player, winning the Golden Ball.England\'s Harry Kane won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals during the tournament with six.Belgium\'s Thibaut Courtois won the Golden Glove, awarded to the goalkeeper with the best performance.It has been estimated that more than 3 million people attended games during the tournament.\n\nThe bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest.Initially, nine countries placed bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico later withdrew from the proceedings, and Indonesia\'s bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian government failed to submit a letter to support the bid.During the bidding process, the three remaining non-UEFA nations (Australia, Japan, and the United States) gradually withdrew from the 2018 bids, and thus all UEFA nations were ruled out of the 2022 bid.As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.\n\nThe 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting.The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third.England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.\n\nThe voting results were:\n\nThe choice of Russia as host was controversial.Issues included the high level of racism in Russian football, human rights abuses by Russian authorities, and discrimination against LGBT people in government (including gay propaganda laws) along with wider Russian society.Russia\'s involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine had also prompted calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the annexation of Crimea.In 2014, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that ""the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work"".\n\nRussia was criticised for alleged abuse of migrant labourers in the construction of World Cup venues, with Human Rights Watch reporting cases where workers were left unpaid, made to work in dangerously cold conditions, or suffering reprisals for raising concerns.A few pundits claimed it was slave labour.In May 2017, FIFA president Gianni Infantino admitted there had been human rights abuses of North Korean workers involved in the construction of Saint Petersburg\'s Zenit Arena.By June 2017, at least 17 workers had died on World Cup construction sites, according to Building and Wood Workers\' International.In August, a group of eight US senators called on FIFA to consider dismissing Russia as the World Cup host if an independent investigation verified allegations of North Koreans being subjected to forced labor.\n\nRacism and Neo-nazi symbols displayed in the past by some Russian football fans drew criticism, with documented incidents of racial chants, banners spewing hate-filled messages, and sometimes assaults on people from the Caucasus and Central Asia.In March 2015, FIFA\'s then Vice President Jeffrey Webb said that Russia posed a huge challenge from a racism standpoint, and that a World Cup could not be held there under the current conditions.On July, United Nations anti-discrimination official Yuri Boychenko said that Russian soccer authorities had failed to fully grasp what racism was and needed to do more to combat it.To address this as well as concerns of hooliganism in general, Russian intelligence services blacklisted over 400 fans from entering the stadiums by June 2018, with 32 other countries also sending officers to help local police screen attendees for valid ID cards.\n\nAllegations of corruption in the bidding processes and concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups led to threats from England\'s FA to boycott the tournament.They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and Sepp Blatter had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.FIFA appointed Michael J. Garcia, a US attorney, to investigate and produce a report on the corruption allegations.Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert.Eckert\'s summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert\'s absolving Russia from blame.Greg Dyke called for a re-examination of the affair and David Bernstein called for a boycott of the World Cup.Garcia criticised the summary as being ""materially incomplete"" with ""erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions"", and appealed to FIFA\'s Appeal Committee.The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned to protest of FIFA\'s conduct, citing a ""lack of leadership"" and lack of confidence in Eckert\'s independence.\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the FBI confirmed that federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.In an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA\'s Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that ""should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled"".Prince William of Wales and former British Prime Minister David Cameron attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in England was discussed.\n\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations—the 209 FIFA member associations except automatically qualified hosts Russia—applied to enter the qualifying process.Zimbabwe and Indonesia were later disqualified before playing their first matches, while Gibraltar and Kosovo, who joined FIFA on 13 May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.The first qualification game, between Timor-Leste and Mongolia, began in Dili on 12 March 2015 as part of the AFC\'s qualification, and the main qualifying draw took place at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, on 25 July 2015.\n\nOf the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2014.Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the smallest country in terms of population to reach the World Cup.Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments included: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, who last appeared in 1982; Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002.Poland, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Sweden have also returned after 12 years.It was the first time three Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four Arab nations (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.\n\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions Italy (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden and were the highest-ranked team to not qualify; and the Netherlands, who were three-time runners-up and had finished in third place in 2014, had qualified for the last three World Cups, and failed to qualify for their second major tournament in a row, missing out on the UEFA Euro 2016 as well.Four reigning continental champions: 2017 Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon; two-time Copa América champions and 2017 Confederations Cup runners-up Chile; 2016 OFC Nations Cup winners New Zealand; and 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup champions the United States (for the first time since 1986) also failed to qualify.The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Ghana and Ivory Coast, both of which had qualified for the three previous tournaments.The lowest-ranked team to qualify was the host nation, Russia.\n\nNote: Numbers in parentheses indicate positions in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the tournament.\n\nAFC (5) (36) (37) (61) (67) (57)\n\nCAF (5) (45) (41) (48) (27) (21)\n\nCONCACAF (3) (23) (15)

December 2017 at 18:00 MSK at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow.The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, by selecting one team from each of the four ranked pots.\n\nFor the draw, the teams were allocated to four pots based entirely on the FIFA World Rankings of October 2017.Pot one contained the hosts Russia (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams.Pot two contained the next best eight teams, and so on for pots three and four.This was different from previous draws, when only pot one was based on FIFA rankings while the remaining pots were based on geographical considerations.However, teams from the same confederation still were not drawn against each other for the group stage, except that two UEFA teams could be in each group.The pots for the draw are shown below.\n\nInitially, each team had to name a preliminary squad of 30 players, but in February 2018 this was increased to 35.From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 23 players (three of whom had to be goalkeepers) by 4 June.Players in the final squad could be replaced for serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team\'s first match.These replacements did not need to have been named in the preliminary squad.\n\nFor players named in the 35-player preliminary squad, there was a mandatory rest period between 21 and 27 May 2018, except for those involved in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final played on 26 May.\n\nOn 29 March 2018, FIFA released the list of 36 referees and 63 assistant referees selected to oversee matches.On 30 April 2018, FIFA released the list of 13 video assistant referees, who acted solely in this capacity in the tournament.\n\nReferee Fahad Al-Mirdasi of Saudi Arabia was removed on 30 May 2018 over a match-fixing attempt, along with his two assistant referees, compatriots Mohammed Al-Abakry and Abdulah Al-Shalwai.A new referee was not appointed, but two assistant referees, Hasan Al Mahri of the United Arab Emirates and Hiroshi Yamauchi of Japan, were added to the list.Assistant referee Marwa Range of Kenya also withdrew after the BBC released an investigation conducted by a Ghanaian journalist which implicated him in a bribery scandal.\n\nShortly after the International Football Association Board\'s decision to incorporate video assistant referees (VARs) into the Laws of the game (LOTG) on 16 March 2018, the FIFA Council took the much-anticipated step of approving the use of VAR for the first time in a FIFA World Cup tournament.\n\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees.Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums\' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.\n\nVAR had a significant impact on several games.On 15 June 2018, Diego Costa\'s first goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision; the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16 June and resulted in a goal by Antoine Griezmann.A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, a phenomenon partially attributed to VAR.Overall, the new technology was both praised and criticised by commentators.FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.\n\nRussia proposed the following host cities: Kaliningrad, Kazan, Krasnodar, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg, Samara, Saransk, Sochi, Volgograd, Yaroslavl, and Yekaterinburg.Each chosen city was located in European Russia (except Yekaterinburg, which is located in Asia but lies very close to the Europe-Asia border) in order to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country.The bid evaluation report stated: ""The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA\'s minimum requirement.Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.""\n\nIn October 2011, Russia reduced the number of stadiums from 16 to 14.Construction of the proposed Podolsk stadium in the Moscow Oblast was cancelled by the regional government.Also, in the capital, Otkritie Arena was competing with Dynamo Stadium over which would be constructed first.\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29 September 2012.The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list.Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8 billion was spent on hosting the tournament.\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.He also said, ""We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums in South Africa, where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums"".\n\nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA\'s inspection committee and its head, Chris Unger, visited St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues.They were satisfied with the progress.On 8 October 2015, FIFA and the local organising committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums to be used during the tournament.Of the twelve venues, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium—the two largest stadiums in Russia—were used most; both hosted seven matches.Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara each hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Otkritie Stadium in Moscow and the Rostov Stadium hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each.Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk each hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\n\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Between 2010 (when Russia were announced as hosts) and 2018, nine of the twelve stadiums were built (some in place of older, outdated venues) and the other three were renovated for the tournament.Kaliningrad: Kaliningrad Stadium (new).The first piles were driven into the ground in September 2015.On 11 April 2018 it hosted its first match.Kazan: Kazan Arena (new).The stadium was built for the 2013 Summer Universiade.It has since hosted the 2015 World Aquatics Championships and the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup.It serves as a home arena for FC Rubin Kazan.Moscow: Luzhniki Stadium (heavily renovated).The largest stadium in the country, it was closed for renovation in 2013.It was commissioned in November 2017.Moscow: Spartak Stadium (new).This stadium is the home arena to its namesake FC Spartak Moscow.In accordance with FIFA requirements, during the 2018 World Cup, it was called Spartak Stadium instead of its usual name Otkritie Arena.It hosted its first match on 5 September 2014.Nizhny Novgorod: Nizhny Novgorod Stadium (new).Construction of this stadium commenced in 2015 and was completed in December 2017.Rostov-on-Don: Rostov Arena (new).The stadium is located on the left bank of the Don.Construction was completed on 22 December 2017.Saint Petersburg: Saint Petersburg Stadium (new).Construction commenced in 2007 after the site, formerly occupied by Kirov Stadium, was cleared.The project was officially completed on 29 December 2016.It has hosted 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup games and served as a venue for UEFA Euro 2020.Samara: Samara Arena (new).Construction officially started on 21 July 2014 and was completed on 21 April 2018.Saransk: Mordovia Arena (new).The stadium in Saransk was scheduled to be commissioned in 2012 in time for the opening of the all-Russian Spartakiad, but the plan was revised.The opening was rescheduled to 2017.The arena hosted its first match on 21 April 2018.Sochi: Fisht Stadium (slightly renovated).This stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics.Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup.Volgograd: Volgograd Arena (new).The main Volgograd arena was built on the demolished

had been renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Its stands have a capacity of 35,000 spectators.The renovation project was completed in December 2017.\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament.On 9 February 2018, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team.\n\nArgentina: Bronnitsy, Moscow Oblast Australia: Kazan,

over $14.2 billion , the 2018 FIFA event was the most expensive World Cup in history, surpassing the $11.6 billion cost of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.\n\nThe Russian government had originally earmarked a budget of around $20 billion, which was later slashed to $10 billion, for World Cup preparations.Half was spent on transportation infrastructure.As part of the program to prepare for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a federal sub-program—""Construction and Renovation of Transport Infrastructure""—was implemented with a total budget of ₽352.5 billion (rubles), with ₽170.3 billion coming from the federal budget, ₽35.1 billion from regional budgets, and ₽147.1 billion from investors.The biggest item of federal spending was the aviation infrastructure costing ₽117.8 billion.Construction of new hotels was a crucial area of infrastructure development in World Cup host cities.Costs continued to mount as preparations were underway.\n\nPlatov International Airport in Rostov-on-Don was upgraded with automated air traffic control systems.Modern surveillance, navigation, communication, control, and meteorological support systems were also installed.Koltsovo Airport in Yekaterinburg was upgraded with radio-engineering tools for flight operation and received a second runway.Saransk Airport received a new navigation system; two new hotels were constructed in the city—the Mercure Saransk Centre (Accor Hotels) and Four Points by Sheraton Saransk as well as few other smaller accommodation facilities.In Samara, new tram lines were laid.Khrabrovo Airport in Kaliningrad was upgraded with radio navigation and weather equipment.Renovation and upgraded radio-engineering tools for flight operations was completed in the Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Volgograd, Samara, Yekaterinburg, Kazan and Sochi airports.On 27 March, the Russian Ministry of Construction Industry, Housing and Utilities Sector of reported that all communications within its area of responsibility had been commissioned.The last facility commissioned was a waste treatment station in Volgograd.In Yekaterinburg, where four matches were hosted, hosting costs increased to over ₽7.4 billion, exceeding the ₽5.6 billion rubles originally allocated from the state and regional budget.\n\nVolunteer applications to the 2018 Russia Local Organising Committee opened on 1 June 2016.The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Volunteer Program received about 177,000 applications, and engaged a total of 35,000 volunteers.They received training at 15 Volunteer Centres of the local organising committee based in 15 universities, and in volunteer centres in the host cities.Preference, especially in key areas, was given to those with knowledge of a foreign language and volunteering experience, but not necessarily to Russian nationals.\n\nFree public transport services were offered for ticketholders during the World Cup, including additional trains linking host cities, as well as services such as bus services within them.\n\nThe full schedule was announced by FIFA on 24 July 2015 without kick-off times, which were confirmed later.On 1 December 2017, following the final draw, FIFA adjusted six kick-off times.\n\nRussia was placed in position A1 in the group stage and played in the opening match at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on 14 June against Saudi Arabia, the two lowest-ranked teams of the tournament at the time of the final draw.The Luzhniki Stadium also hosted the second semi-final on 11 July and the final on 15 July.The Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg hosted the first semi-final on 10 July and the third place play-off on 14 July.\n\nThe opening ceremony took place on Thursday, 14 June 2018, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, preceding the opening match of the tournament between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia.\n\nAt the start of the ceremony, Russian president Vladimir Putin gave a speech, welcoming the countries of the world to Russia and calling football a uniting force.Brazilian World Cup-winning striker Ronaldo entered the stadium with a child in a Russia jersey.Pop singer Robbie Williams then sang two of his songs solo before he and Russian soprano Aida Garifullina performed a duet.Dancers dressed in the flags of the 32 competing teams appeared carrying a sign with the name of each nation.At the end of the ceremony Ronaldo reappeared with the official match ball which had returned from the International Space Station in early June.\n\nYoung participants of the international children\'s social programme Football for Friendship from 211 countries and regions took part in the opening ceremony of the FIFA World Cup at the Luzhniki stadium.\n\nCompeting countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H).Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage.Ten European teams and four South American teams progressed to the knockout stage, together with Japan and Mexico.\n\nFor the first time since 1938, Germany, the reigning champions, were eliminated in the first round.This was the third consecutive tournament in which the holders were eliminated in the first round, after Italy in 2010 and Spain in 2014.No African team progressed to the second round for the first time since 1982.The fair play criteria came into use for the first time when Japan qualified over Senegal because the team had received fewer yellow cards.Only one match, France versus Denmark, was goalless.Until then there were a record 36 straight games in which at least one goal was scored.All times listed below are local time.\n\nIn the knockout stages, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winners.If a match went into extra time, each team was allowed to make a fourth substitution, the first time this had been allowed in a FIFA World Cup tournament.Below is the bracket for the knockout round of the tournament, teams in bold denote match winners.\n\nIn total, only four players were sent off in the entire tournament, the fewest since 1978.International Football Association Board technical director David Elleray stated a belief that this was due to the introduction of VAR, since players would know that they would not be able to get away with anything under the new system.\n\nA player is automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences: Receiving a red card (red card suspensions may be extended for serious offences)Receiving two yellow cards in two matches; yellow cards expire after the completion of the quarter-finals (yellow card suspensions are not carried forward to any other future international matches)\n\nThe following suspensions were served during the tournament:\n\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament.The Golden Boot (top scorer), Golden Ball (best overall player) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper) awards were all sponsored by Adidas.\n\nThe users of FIFA.com elected their Fan Dream Team.\n\nAdditionally, FIFA.com shortlisted 18 goals for users to vote on as the tournament\'s best.The poll closed on 23 July.The award was sponsored by Hyundai.\n\nFIFA published an All-Star Team, this year called the Fantasy Team, based on player performances evaluated through statistical data.\n\nPrize money amounts were announced in October 2017.\n\nThe tournament logo was unveiled on 28 October 2014 by cosmonauts at the International Space Station and then projected onto Moscow\'s Bolshoi Theatre during an evening television programme.Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said the logo was inspired by ""Russia\'s rich artistic tradition and its history of bold achievement and innovation"", and FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that it reflected the ""heart and soul"" of the country.For branding, Portuguese design agency Brandia Central created materials in 2014, with a typeface called Dusha – – designed by Brandia Central and edited by Adotbelow of the DSType Foundry in Portugal.\n\nThe first phase of ticket sales started on 14 September 2017, 12:00 Moscow Time, and lasted until 12 October 2017.\n\nThe general visa policy of Russia did not apply to participants and spectators, who were able to visit Russia without a visa right before and during the competition regardless of their citizenship.Spectators were nonetheless required to register for a ""Fan-ID"", a special photo identification pass.A Fan-ID was required to enter the country visa-free, while a ticket, Fan-ID and a valid passport were required to enter stadiums for matches.Fan-IDs also granted World Cup attendees free access to public transport services, including buses, and train service between host cities.Fan-ID was administered by the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, which could revoke this accreditation at any time to ""ensure the defence capability or security of the state or public order"".\n\nOn 29 May 2018, Electronic Arts released a free update to their video game FIFA 18 that added content related to the 2018 FIFA World Cup.The expansion included a World Cup tournament mode with all teams and stadiums from the event, official television presentation elements, and World Cup-related content for the Ultimate Team mode.\n\nPanini continued their partnership with FIFA by producing stickers for their World Cup sticker album.Panini also developed an app for the 2018 World Cup where fans could collect and swap virtual stickers, with 5 million fans gathering digital stickers for the tournament.\n\nThe tournament\'s official mascot was unveiled on 21 October 2016, and selected through a design competition among university students.A public vote was used to select the mascot from three finalists—a cat, a tiger, and a wolf.The winner, with 53% or approximately 1 million votes, was Zabivaka—an anthropomorphic wolf dressed in the colours of the Russian national team.Zabivaka\'s name is a portmanteau of the Russian words забияка (""hothead"") and забивать (""to score""), and his official backstory states that he is an aspiring football player who is ""charming, confident and social"".\n\nThe official match ball, the ""Telstar 18"", was unveiled on 9 November 2017.It was based on the name and design of the first Adidas World Cup ball from 1970.A special red-coloured variation, ""Telstar Mechta"", was used for the knockout stage of the tournament.The word mechta (Russian: мечта) means ""dream"" or ""ambition"".\n\nGoalkeepers noted that the ball was slippery and prone to having unpredictable trajectory.In addition, two Telstar 18 balls popped in the midst of a first-round match between France and Australia, leading to further discussions over the ball\'s performance.\n\nThe official song of the tournament was ""Live It Up"", with vocals by Will Smith, Nicky Jam and Era Istrefi, released on 25 May 2018.Its music video was released on 8 June 2018.\n\nThirty-three footballers who were alleged to be part of the Russian steroid programme are listed in the McLaren Report.On 22 December 2017, it was reported that FIFA had fired a doctor who had been investigating doping in Russian football.On 22 May 2018, FIFA stated that the investigations concerning all Russian players named for the provisional squad of the FIFA World Cup in Russia had been completed, with the result that insufficient evidence was found to support anti-doping rule violations.FIFA\'s medical committee also decided that Russian personnel would not be involved in performing drug testing procedures at the tournament, an action taken to reassure teams that samples would not be tampered with.\n\nRussia relaxed its visa rules during the World Cup, allowing Fan ID holders to enter and exit Russia without a visa through 31 December 2018.Traffickers exploited this system to bring foreign sex trafficking victims into the country, especially from Nigeria.Reuters had raised concerns about the victims\' conditions, who had allegedly been forced into prostitution, with some of them enduring violent abuse.Russian authorities were accused of doing little to fix to the issue, allegedly because many locals blamed the victims for falling into prostitution.\n\nIn response to the March 2018 poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, British prime minister Theresa May announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans.Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that the West are trying to ""take the World Cup out of Russia"".The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced Boris Johnson\'s statements that compared the event to the 1936 Olympics held in Nazi Germany as ""poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness"" and ""unacceptable and unworthy"" parallel towards Russia, a ""nation that lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism"".\n\nAt the close of the World Cup, Russia was widely praised for its success in hosting the tournament, with Steve Rosenberg of the BBC deeming it ""a resounding public relations success"" for Putin, adding: ""The stunning new stadiums, free train travel to venues and the absence of crowd violence has impressed visiting supporters.Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country\'s authoritarian image.All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised.""\n\nDespite the British Foreign Office and MPs repeatedly warning English football fans travelling to Russia of ""racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility"", fans who did travel said they received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino stated: ""Everyone discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, that is keen to show the world that everything that has been said before might not be true.A lot of preconceived ideas have been changed because people have seen the true nature of Russia.""Infantino has proclaimed Russia 2018 to be ""the best World Cup ever.""98 percent of the stadiums were sold out, there were 3 billion viewers on TV around the world and 7 million fans visited the fan fests.It was the most viewed World Cup to date, and the third most viewed television broadcast, surpassing the Beijing Olympics in 2008.\n\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters.After having tested the technology at limited matches of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the 2014 FIFA World Cup (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of Rio de Janeiro), the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in 4K ultra high definition.Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut of each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being converted up from 1080p high definition sources with limited degradation in quality.These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder UA:PBC stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup due to existing tensions with Russia amidst the Russo-Ukrainian War.This came in the wake of growing boycott of the tournament by the Football Federation of Ukraine and sports minister Ihor Zhdanov.Additionally, the FFU refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing diplomatic crisis in Qatar, which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar—the home country of FIFA\'s Middle East and Africa rightsholder beIN Sports—in June 2017, over its alleged state support of terrorist groups.On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from Du and Etisalat, but with service to the latter restored later that day.Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as ""beoutQ"".While FIFA attempted to negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final indirectly, they were unable to do so.On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had ""engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.""\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men\'s World Cup whose English rights were held by Fox Sports, and Spanish rights held by Telemundo.The elimination of the United States in the qualifiers led to concerns that U.S. interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that ""casual"" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5 million in 2014, and determined how much Fox paid for the rights.During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among Hispanic and Latino Americans.Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of tournament coverage.Viewership was down overall compared to 2014; match scheduling and time zones were not as favourable to viewers in the Americas as they were in 2014.Many games aired in the morning hours, although Telemundo\'s broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday daytime program in the network\'s history.\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, Korean Central Television acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea.Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time.In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to strained relations and campaigns against the country.\n\nA combined 3.572 billion unique viewers (live global 1-minute reach) – more than half of the global population aged four and over – tuned in to world football\'s ultimate competition, according to audience data for official broadcast coverage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe average global live audience for every game of the tournament was 191 million viewers (for a cumulative live audience of 12.224 billion viewers), a 2.1% increase over the 2014 tournament average of 187 million viewers, including that average audience in the early stages (group stage and round of 16) were bigger than in 2014.However, in 2018, the audience was 15 percent smaller for the semi-finals, 17 percent for the third place play-off, and 5.1 percent for the final, which was watched by 517 million people on average (only in-home TV viewers), compared to 545 million in 2014.Presumably, the reason for that is the smaller countries involved in the top four games compared to those in 2014, and only one global region (Europe) being represented in 2018 (compared to South America and Europe in 2014).However the live global 1-minute reach of the final was 1.12 billion people (884.37 in-home TV viewers and 231.82 million out-of-home and (or) digital-only viewers).\n\nFIFA World Cup FIFA World Cup hosts 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup 2019 FIFA Women\'s World Cup\n', 'Claim_Context': ""Croatian player Luka Modrić

7,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018 FIFA World Cup', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The 2018 FIFA World Cup was the 21st FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for national football teams organized by FIFA.It took place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in late 2010.It was the eleventh time the championships had been held in Europe, the first time they were held in Eastern Europe, and the first time they were held across two continents (Europe and Asia).At an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion, it was the most expensive World Cup ever held until it was surpassed by the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nThe tournament phase involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through qualifying competitions, while the host nation Russia qualified automatically.Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the 2014 event, while Iceland and Panama each made their debut at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities.Germany, the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage for the first time since 1938.Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals.In the final, France played Croatia on 15 July at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.France won the match 4–2, claiming their second World Cup and becoming the fourth consecutive title won by a European team, after Italy in 2006, Spain in 2010, and Germany in 2014.\n\nCroatian player Luka Modrić was voted the tournament\'s best player, winning the Golden Ball.England\'s Harry Kane won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals during the tournament with six.Belgium\'s Thibaut Courtois won the Golden Glove, awarded to the goalkeeper with the best performance.It has been estimated that more than 3 million people attended games during the tournament.\n\nThe bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest.Initially, nine countries placed bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico later withdrew from the proceedings, and Indonesia\'s bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian government failed to submit a letter to support the bid.During the bidding process, the three remaining non-UEFA nations (Australia, Japan, and the United States) gradually withdrew from the 2018 bids, and thus all UEFA nations were ruled out of the 2022 bid.As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.\n\nThe 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting.The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third.England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.\n\nThe voting results were:\n\nThe choice of Russia as host was controversial.Issues included the high level of racism in Russian football, human rights abuses by Russian authorities, and discrimination against LGBT people in government (including gay propaganda laws) along with wider Russian society.Russia\'s involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine had also prompted calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the annexation of Crimea.In 2014, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that ""the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work"".\n\nRussia was criticised for alleged abuse of migrant labourers in the construction of World Cup venues, with Human Rights Watch reporting cases where workers were left unpaid, made to work in dangerously cold conditions, or suffering reprisals for raising concerns.A few pundits claimed it was slave labour.In May 2017, FIFA president Gianni Infantino admitted there had been human rights abuses of North Korean workers involved in the construction of Saint Petersburg\'s Zenit Arena.By June 2017, at least 17 workers had died on World Cup construction sites, according to Building and Wood Workers\' International.In August, a group of eight US senators called on FIFA to consider dismissing Russia as the World Cup host if an independent investigation verified allegations of North Koreans being subjected to forced labor.\n\nRacism and Neo-nazi symbols displayed in the past by some Russian football fans drew criticism, with documented incidents of racial chants, banners spewing hate-filled messages, and sometimes assaults on people from the Caucasus and Central Asia.In March 2015, FIFA\'s then Vice President Jeffrey Webb said that Russia posed a huge challenge from a racism standpoint, and that a World Cup could not be held there under the current conditions.On July, United Nations anti-discrimination official Yuri Boychenko said that Russian soccer authorities had failed to fully grasp what racism was and needed to do more to combat it.To address this as well as concerns of hooliganism in general, Russian intelligence services blacklisted over 400 fans from entering the stadiums by June 2018, with 32 other countries also sending officers to help local police screen attendees for valid ID cards.\n\nAllegations of corruption in the bidding processes and concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups led to threats from England\'s FA to boycott the tournament.They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and Sepp Blatter had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.FIFA appointed Michael J. Garcia, a US attorney, to investigate and produce a report on the corruption allegations.Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert.Eckert\'s summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert\'s absolving Russia from blame.Greg Dyke called for a re-examination of the affair and David Bernstein called for a boycott of the World Cup.Garcia criticised the summary as being ""materially incomplete"" with ""erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions"", and appealed to FIFA\'s Appeal Committee.The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned to protest of FIFA\'s conduct, citing a ""lack of leadership"" and lack of confidence in Eckert\'s independence.\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the FBI confirmed that federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.In an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA\'s Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that ""should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled"".Prince William of Wales and former British Prime Minister David Cameron attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in England was discussed.\n\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations—the 209 FIFA member associations except automatically qualified hosts Russia—applied to enter the qualifying process.Zimbabwe and Indonesia were later disqualified before playing their first matches, while Gibraltar and Kosovo, who joined FIFA on 13 May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.The first qualification game, between Timor-Leste and Mongolia, began in Dili on 12 March 2015 as part of the AFC\'s qualification, and the main qualifying draw took place at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, on 25 July 2015.\n\nOf the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2014.Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the smallest country in terms of population to reach the World Cup.Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments included: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, who last appeared in 1982; Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002.Poland, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Sweden have also returned after 12 years.It was the first time three Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four Arab nations (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.\n\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions Italy (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden and were the highest-ranked team to not qualify; and the Netherlands, who were three-time runners-up and had finished in third place in 2014, had qualified for the last three World Cups, and failed to qualify for their second major tournament in a row, missing out on the UEFA Euro 2016 as well.Four reigning continental champions: 2017 Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon; two-time Copa América champions and 2017 Confederations Cup runners-up Chile; 2016 OFC Nations Cup winners New Zealand; and 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup champions the United States (for the first time since 1986) also failed to qualify.The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Ghana and Ivory Coast, both of which had qualified for the three previous tournaments.The lowest-ranked team to qualify was the host nation, Russia.\n\nNote: Numbers in parentheses indicate positions in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the tournament.\n\nAFC (5) (36) (37) (61) (67) (57)\n\nCAF (5) (45) (41) (48) (27) (21)\n\nCONCACAF (3) (23) (15)

December 2017 at 18:00 MSK at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow.The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, by selecting one team from each of the four ranked pots.\n\nFor the draw, the teams were allocated to four pots based entirely on the FIFA World Rankings of October 2017.Pot one contained the hosts Russia (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams.Pot two contained the next best eight teams, and so on for pots three and four.This was different from previous draws, when only pot one was based on FIFA rankings while the remaining pots were based on geographical considerations.However, teams from the same confederation still were not drawn against each other for the group stage, except that two UEFA teams could be in each group.The pots for the draw are shown below.\n\nInitially, each team had to name a preliminary squad of 30 players, but in February 2018 this was increased to 35.From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 23 players (three of whom had to be goalkeepers) by 4 June.Players in the final squad could be replaced for serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team\'s first match.These replacements did not need to have been named in the preliminary squad.\n\nFor players named in the 35-player preliminary squad, there was a mandatory rest period between 21 and 27 May 2018, except for those involved in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final played on 26 May.\n\nOn 29 March 2018, FIFA released the list of 36 referees and 63 assistant referees selected to oversee matches.On 30 April 2018, FIFA released the list of 13 video assistant referees, who acted solely in this capacity in the tournament.\n\nReferee Fahad Al-Mirdasi of Saudi Arabia was removed on 30 May 2018 over a match-fixing attempt, along with his two assistant referees, compatriots Mohammed Al-Abakry and Abdulah Al-Shalwai.A new referee was not appointed, but two assistant referees, Hasan Al Mahri of the United Arab Emirates and Hiroshi Yamauchi of Japan, were added to the list.Assistant referee Marwa Range of Kenya also withdrew after the BBC released an investigation conducted by a Ghanaian journalist which implicated him in a bribery scandal.\n\nShortly after the International Football Association Board\'s decision to incorporate video assistant referees (VARs) into the Laws of the game (LOTG) on 16 March 2018, the FIFA Council took the much-anticipated step of approving the use of VAR for the first time in a FIFA World Cup tournament.\n\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees.Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums\' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.\n\nVAR had a significant impact on several games.On 15 June 2018, Diego Costa\'s first goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision; the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16 June and resulted in a goal by Antoine Griezmann.A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, a phenomenon partially attributed to VAR.Overall, the new technology was both praised and criticised by commentators.FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.\n\nRussia proposed the following host cities: Kaliningrad, Kazan, Krasnodar, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg, Samara, Saransk, Sochi, Volgograd, Yaroslavl, and Yekaterinburg.Each chosen city was located in European Russia (except Yekaterinburg, which is located in Asia but lies very close to the Europe-Asia border) in order to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country.The bid evaluation report stated: ""The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA\'s minimum requirement.Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.""\n\nIn October 2011, Russia reduced the number of stadiums from 16 to 14.Construction of the proposed Podolsk stadium in the Moscow Oblast was cancelled by the regional government.Also, in the capital, Otkritie Arena was competing with Dynamo Stadium over which would be constructed first.\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29 September 2012.The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list.Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8 billion was spent on hosting the tournament.\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.He also said, ""We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums in South Africa, where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums"".\n\nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA\'s inspection committee and its head, Chris Unger, visited St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues.They were satisfied with the progress.On 8 October 2015, FIFA and the local organising committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums to be used during the tournament.Of the twelve venues, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium—the two largest stadiums in Russia—were used most; both hosted seven matches.Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara each hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Otkritie Stadium in Moscow and the Rostov Stadium hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each.Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk each hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\n\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Between 2010 (when Russia were announced as hosts) and 2018, nine of the twelve stadiums were built (some in place of older, outdated venues) and the other three were renovated for the tournament.Kaliningrad: Kaliningrad Stadium (new).The first piles were driven into the ground in September 2015.On 11 April 2018 it hosted its first match.Kazan: Kazan Arena (new).The stadium was built for the 2013 Summer Universiade.It has since hosted the 2015 World Aquatics Championships and the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup.It serves as a home arena for FC Rubin Kazan.Moscow: Luzhniki Stadium (heavily renovated).The largest stadium in the country, it was closed for renovation in 2013.It was commissioned in November 2017.Moscow: Spartak Stadium (new).This stadium is the home arena to its namesake FC Spartak Moscow.In accordance with FIFA requirements, during the 2018 World Cup, it was called Spartak Stadium instead of its usual name Otkritie Arena.It hosted its first match on 5 September 2014.Nizhny Novgorod: Nizhny Novgorod Stadium (new).Construction of this stadium commenced in 2015 and was completed in December 2017.Rostov-on-Don: Rostov Arena (new).The stadium is located on the left bank of the Don.Construction was completed on 22 December 2017.Saint Petersburg: Saint Petersburg Stadium (new).Construction commenced in 2007 after the site, formerly occupied by Kirov Stadium, was cleared.The project was officially completed on 29 December 2016.It has hosted 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup games and served as a venue for UEFA Euro 2020.Samara: Samara Arena (new).Construction officially started on 21 July 2014 and was completed on 21 April 2018.Saransk: Mordovia Arena (new).The stadium in Saransk was scheduled to be commissioned in 2012 in time for the opening of the all-Russian Spartakiad, but the plan was revised.The opening was rescheduled to 2017.The arena hosted its first match on 21 April 2018.Sochi: Fisht Stadium (slightly renovated).This stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics.Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup.Volgograd: Volgograd Arena (new).The main Volgograd arena was built on the demolished Central Stadium site, at the foot of the Mamayev Kurgan memorial complex.It was commissioned on 3 April 2018.Yekaterinburg: Ekaterinburg Arena (heavily renovated).The Central Stadium of Yekaterinburg had been renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Its stands have a capacity of 35,000 spectators.The renovation project was completed in December 2017.\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament.On 9 February 2018, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team.\n\nArgentina: Bronnitsy, Moscow Oblast Australia: Kazan, Tatarstan Belgium: Krasnogorsky, Moscow Oblast Brazil: Sochi, Krasnodar Krai Colombia: Verkhneuslonsky, Tatarstan Costa Rica: Saint Petersburg Croatia: Roshchino, Leningrad Oblast Denmark: Anapa,

over $14.2 billion , the 2018 FIFA event was the most expensive World Cup in history, surpassing the $11.6 billion cost of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.\n\nThe Russian government had originally earmarked a budget of around $20 billion, which was later slashed to $10 billion, for World Cup preparations.Half was spent on transportation infrastructure.As part of the program to prepare for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a federal sub-program—""Construction and Renovation of Transport Infrastructure""—was implemented with a total budget of ₽352.5 billion (rubles), with ₽170.3 billion coming from the federal budget, ₽35.1 billion from regional budgets, and ₽147.1 billion from investors.The biggest item of federal spending was the aviation infrastructure costing ₽117.8 billion.Construction of new hotels was a crucial area of infrastructure development in World Cup host cities.Costs continued to mount as preparations were underway.\n\nPlatov International Airport in Rostov-on-Don was upgraded with automated air traffic control systems.Modern surveillance, navigation, communication, control, and meteorological support systems were also installed.Koltsovo Airport in Yekaterinburg was upgraded with radio-engineering tools for flight operation and received a second runway.Saransk Airport received a new navigation system; two new hotels were constructed in the city—the Mercure Saransk Centre (Accor Hotels) and Four Points by Sheraton Saransk as well as few other smaller accommodation facilities.In Samara, new tram lines were laid.Khrabrovo Airport in Kaliningrad was upgraded with radio navigation and weather equipment.Renovation and upgraded radio-engineering tools for flight operations was completed in the Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Volgograd, Samara, Yekaterinburg, Kazan and Sochi airports.On 27 March, the Russian Ministry of Construction Industry, Housing and Utilities Sector of reported that all communications within its area of responsibility had been commissioned.The last facility commissioned was a waste treatment station in Volgograd.In Yekaterinburg, where four matches were hosted, hosting costs increased to over ₽7.4 billion, exceeding the ₽5.6 billion rubles originally allocated from the state and regional budget.\n\nVolunteer applications to the 2018 Russia Local Organising Committee opened on 1 June 2016.The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Volunteer Program received about 177,000 applications, and engaged a total of 35,000 volunteers.They received training at 15 Volunteer Centres of the local organising committee based in 15 universities, and in volunteer centres in the host cities.Preference, especially in key areas, was given to those with knowledge of a foreign language and volunteering experience, but not necessarily to Russian nationals.\n\nFree public transport services were offered for ticketholders during the World Cup, including additional trains linking host cities, as well as services such as bus services within them.\n\nThe full schedule was announced by FIFA on 24 July 2015 without kick-off times, which were confirmed later.On 1 December 2017, following the final draw, FIFA adjusted six kick-off times.\n\nRussia was placed in position A1 in the group stage and played in the opening match at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on 14 June against Saudi Arabia, the two lowest-ranked teams of the tournament at the time of the final draw.The Luzhniki Stadium also hosted the second semi-final on 11 July and the final on 15 July.The Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg hosted the first semi-final on 10 July and the third place play-off on 14 July.\n\nThe opening ceremony took place on Thursday, 14 June 2018, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, preceding the opening match of the tournament between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia.\n\nAt the start of the ceremony, Russian president Vladimir Putin gave a speech, welcoming the countries of the world to Russia and calling football a uniting force.Brazilian World Cup-winning striker Ronaldo entered the stadium with a child in a Russia jersey.Pop singer Robbie Williams then sang two of his songs solo before he and Russian soprano Aida Garifullina performed a duet.Dancers dressed in the flags of the 32 competing teams appeared carrying a sign with the name of each nation.At the end of the ceremony Ronaldo reappeared with the official match ball which had returned from the International Space Station in early June.\n\nYoung participants of the international children\'s social programme Football for Friendship from 211 countries and regions took part in the opening ceremony of the FIFA World Cup at the Luzhniki stadium.\n\nCompeting countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H).Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage.Ten European teams and four South American teams progressed to the knockout stage, together with Japan and Mexico.\n\nFor the first time since 1938, Germany, the reigning champions, were eliminated in the first round.This was the third consecutive tournament in which the holders were eliminated in the first round, after Italy in 2010 and Spain in 2014.No African team progressed to the second round for the first time since 1982.The fair play criteria came into use for the first time when Japan qualified over Senegal because the team had received fewer yellow cards.Only one match, France versus Denmark, was goalless.Until then there were a record 36 straight games in which at least one goal was scored.All times listed below are local time.\n\nIn the knockout stages, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winners.If a match went into extra time, each team was allowed to make a fourth substitution, the first time this had been allowed in a FIFA World Cup tournament.Below is the bracket for the knockout round of the tournament, teams in bold denote match winners.\n\nIn total, only four players were sent off in the entire tournament, the fewest since 1978.International Football Association Board technical director David Elleray stated a belief that this was due to the introduction of VAR, since players would know that they would not be able to get away with anything under the new system.\n\nA player is automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences: Receiving a red card (red card suspensions may be extended for serious offences)Receiving two yellow cards in two matches; yellow cards expire after the completion of the quarter-finals (yellow card suspensions are not carried forward to any other future international matches)\n\nThe following suspensions were served during the tournament:\n\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament.The Golden Boot (top scorer), Golden Ball (best overall player) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper) awards were all sponsored by Adidas.\n\nThe users of FIFA.com elected their Fan Dream Team.\n\nAdditionally, FIFA.com shortlisted 18 goals for users to vote on as the tournament\'s best.The poll closed on 23 July.The award was sponsored by Hyundai.\n\nFIFA published an All-Star Team, this year called the Fantasy Team, based on player performances evaluated through statistical data.\n\nPrize money amounts were announced in October 2017.\n\nThe tournament logo was unveiled on 28 October 2014 by cosmonauts at the International Space Station and then projected onto Moscow\'s Bolshoi Theatre during an evening television programme.Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said the logo was inspired by ""Russia\'s rich artistic tradition and its history of bold achievement and innovation"", and FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that it reflected the ""heart and soul"" of the country.For branding, Portuguese design agency Brandia Central created materials in 2014, with a typeface called Dusha – – designed by Brandia Central and edited by Adotbelow of the DSType Foundry in Portugal.\n\nThe first phase of ticket sales started on 14 September 2017, 12:00 Moscow Time, and lasted until 12 October 2017.\n\nThe general visa policy of Russia did not apply to participants and spectators, who were able to visit Russia without a visa right before and during the competition regardless of their citizenship.Spectators were nonetheless required to register for a ""Fan-ID"", a special photo identification pass.A Fan-ID was required to enter the country visa-free, while a ticket, Fan-ID and a valid passport were required to enter stadiums for matches.Fan-IDs also granted World Cup attendees free access to public transport services, including buses, and train service between host cities.Fan-ID was administered by the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, which could revoke this accreditation at any time to ""ensure the defence capability or security of the state or public order"".\n\nOn 29 May 2018, Electronic Arts released a free update to their video game FIFA 18 that added content related to the 2018 FIFA World Cup.The expansion included a World Cup tournament mode with all teams and stadiums from the event, official television presentation elements, and World Cup-related content for the Ultimate Team mode.\n\nPanini continued their partnership with FIFA by producing stickers for their World Cup sticker album.Panini also developed an app for the 2018 World Cup where fans could collect and swap virtual stickers, with 5 million fans gathering digital stickers for the tournament.\n\nThe tournament\'s official mascot was unveiled on 21 October 2016, and selected through a design competition among university students.A public vote was used to select the mascot from three finalists—a cat, a tiger, and a wolf.The winner, with 53% or approximately 1 million votes, was Zabivaka—an anthropomorphic wolf dressed in the colours of the Russian national team.Zabivaka\'s name is a portmanteau of the Russian words забияка (""hothead"") and забивать (""to score""), and his official backstory states that he is an aspiring football player who is ""charming, confident and social"".\n\nThe official match ball, the ""Telstar 18"", was unveiled on 9 November 2017.It was based on the name and design of the first Adidas World Cup ball from 1970.A special red-coloured variation, ""Telstar Mechta"", was used for the knockout stage of the tournament.The word mechta (Russian: мечта) means ""dream"" or ""ambition"".\n\nGoalkeepers noted that the ball was slippery and prone to having unpredictable trajectory.In addition, two Telstar 18 balls popped in the midst of a first-round match between France and Australia, leading to further discussions over the ball\'s performance.\n\nThe official song of the tournament was ""Live It Up"", with vocals by Will Smith, Nicky Jam and Era Istrefi, released on 25 May 2018.Its music video was released on 8 June 2018.\n\nThirty-three footballers who were alleged to be part of the Russian steroid programme are listed in the McLaren Report.On 22 December 2017, it was reported that FIFA had fired a doctor who had been investigating doping in Russian football.On 22 May 2018, FIFA stated that the investigations concerning all Russian players named for the provisional squad of the FIFA World Cup in Russia had been completed, with the result that insufficient evidence was found to support anti-doping rule violations.FIFA\'s medical committee also decided that Russian personnel would not be involved in performing drug testing procedures at the tournament, an action taken to reassure teams that samples would not be tampered with.\n\nRussia relaxed its visa rules during the World Cup, allowing Fan ID holders to enter and exit Russia without a visa through 31 December 2018.Traffickers exploited this system to bring foreign sex trafficking victims into the country, especially from Nigeria.Reuters had raised concerns about the victims\' conditions, who had allegedly been forced into prostitution, with some of them enduring violent abuse.Russian authorities were accused of doing little to fix to the issue, allegedly because many locals blamed the victims for falling into prostitution.\n\nIn response to the March 2018 poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, British prime minister Theresa May announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans.Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that the West are trying to ""take the World Cup out of Russia"".The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced Boris Johnson\'s statements that compared the event to the 1936 Olympics held in Nazi Germany as ""poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness"" and ""unacceptable and unworthy"" parallel towards Russia, a ""nation that lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism"".\n\nAt the close of the World Cup, Russia was widely praised for its success in hosting the tournament, with Steve Rosenberg of the BBC deeming it ""a resounding public relations success"" for Putin, adding: ""The stunning new stadiums, free train travel to venues and the absence of crowd violence has impressed visiting supporters.Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country\'s authoritarian image.All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised.""\n\nDespite the British Foreign Office and MPs repeatedly warning English football fans travelling to Russia of ""racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility"", fans who did travel said they received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino stated: ""Everyone discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, that is keen to show the world that everything that has been said before might not be true.A lot of preconceived ideas have been changed because people have seen the true nature of Russia.""Infantino has proclaimed Russia 2018 to be ""the best World Cup ever.""98 percent of the stadiums were sold out, there were 3 billion viewers on TV around the world and 7 million fans visited the fan fests.It was the most viewed World Cup to date, and the third most viewed television broadcast, surpassing the Beijing Olympics in 2008.\n\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters.After having tested the technology at limited matches of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the 2014 FIFA World Cup (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of Rio de Janeiro), the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in 4K ultra high definition.Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut of each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being converted up from 1080p high definition sources with limited degradation in quality.These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder UA:PBC stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup due to existing tensions with Russia amidst the Russo-Ukrainian War.This came in the wake of growing boycott of the tournament by the Football Federation of Ukraine and sports minister Ihor Zhdanov.Additionally, the FFU refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing diplomatic crisis in Qatar, which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar—the home country of FIFA\'s Middle East and Africa rightsholder beIN Sports—in June 2017, over its alleged state support of terrorist groups.On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from Du and Etisalat, but with service to the latter restored later that day.Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as ""beoutQ"".While FIFA attempted to negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final indirectly, they were unable to do so.On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had ""engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.""\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men\'s World Cup whose English rights were held by Fox Sports, and Spanish rights held by Telemundo.The elimination of the United States in the qualifiers led to concerns that U.S. interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that ""casual"" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5 million in 2014, and determined how much Fox paid for the rights.During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among Hispanic and Latino Americans.Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of tournament coverage.Viewership was down overall compared to 2014; match scheduling and time zones were not as favourable to viewers in the Americas as they were in 2014.Many games aired in the morning hours, although Telemundo\'s broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday daytime program in the network\'s history.\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, Korean Central Television acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea.Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time.In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to strained relations and campaigns against the country.\n\nA combined 3.572 billion unique viewers (live global 1-minute reach) – more than half of the global population aged four and over – tuned in to world football\'s ultimate competition, according to audience data for official broadcast coverage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe average global live audience for every game of the tournament was 191 million viewers (for a cumulative live audience of 12.224 billion viewers), a 2.1% increase over the 2014 tournament average of 187 million viewers, including that average audience in the early stages (group stage and round of 16) were bigger than in 2014.However, in 2018, the audience was 15 percent smaller for the semi-finals, 17 percent for the third place play-off, and 5.1 percent for the final, which was watched by 517 million people on average (only in-home TV viewers), compared to 545 million in 2014.Presumably, the reason for that is the smaller countries involved in the top four games compared to those in 2014, and only one global region (Europe) being represented in 2018 (compared to South America and Europe in 2014).However the live global 1-minute reach of the final was 1.12 billion people (884.37 in-home TV viewers and 231.82 million out-of-home and (or) digital-only viewers).\n\nFIFA World Cup FIFA World Cup hosts 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup 2019 FIFA Women\'s World Cup\n', 'Claim_Context': ""Croatian player Luka Modrić

8,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018 FIFA World Cup', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The 2018 FIFA World Cup was the 21st FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for national football teams organized by FIFA.It took place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in late 2010.It was the eleventh time the championships had been held in Europe, the first time they were held in Eastern Europe, and the first time they were held across two continents (Europe and Asia).At an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion, it was the most expensive World Cup ever held until it was surpassed by the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nThe tournament phase involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through qualifying competitions, while the host nation Russia qualified automatically.Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the 2014 event, while Iceland and Panama each made their debut at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities.Germany, the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage for the first time since 1938.Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals.In the final, France played Croatia on 15 July at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.France won the match 4–2, claiming their second World Cup and becoming the fourth consecutive title won by a European team, after Italy in 2006, Spain in 2010, and Germany in 2014.\n\nCroatian player Luka Modrić was voted the tournament\'s best player, winning the Golden Ball.England\'s Harry Kane won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals during the tournament with six.Belgium\'s Thibaut Courtois won the Golden Glove, awarded to the goalkeeper with the best performance.It has been estimated that more than 3 million people attended games during the tournament.\n\nThe bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest.Initially, nine countries placed bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico later withdrew from the proceedings, and Indonesia\'s bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian government failed to submit a letter to support the bid.During the bidding process, the three remaining non-UEFA nations (Australia, Japan, and the United States) gradually withdrew from the 2018 bids, and thus all UEFA nations were ruled out of the 2022 bid.As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.\n\nThe 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting.The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third.England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.\n\nThe voting results were:\n\nThe choice of Russia as host was controversial.Issues included the high level of racism in Russian football, human rights abuses by Russian authorities, and discrimination against LGBT people in government (including gay propaganda laws) along with wider Russian society.Russia\'s involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine had also prompted calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the annexation of Crimea.In 2014, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that ""the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work"".\n\nRussia was criticised for alleged abuse of migrant labourers in the construction of World Cup venues, with Human Rights Watch reporting cases where workers were left unpaid, made to work in dangerously cold conditions, or suffering reprisals for raising concerns.A few pundits claimed it was slave labour.In May 2017, FIFA president Gianni Infantino admitted there had been human rights abuses of North Korean workers involved in the construction of Saint Petersburg\'s Zenit Arena.By June 2017, at least 17 workers had died on World Cup construction sites, according to Building and Wood Workers\' International.In August, a group of eight US senators called on FIFA to consider dismissing Russia as the World Cup host if an independent investigation verified allegations of North Koreans being subjected to forced labor.\n\nRacism and Neo-nazi symbols displayed in the past by some Russian football fans drew criticism, with documented incidents of racial chants, banners spewing hate-filled messages, and sometimes assaults on people from the Caucasus and Central Asia.In March 2015, FIFA\'s then Vice President Jeffrey Webb said that Russia posed a huge challenge from a racism standpoint, and that a World Cup could not be held there under the current conditions.On July, United Nations anti-discrimination official Yuri Boychenko said that Russian soccer authorities had failed to fully grasp what racism was and needed to do more to combat it.To address this as well as concerns of hooliganism in general, Russian intelligence services blacklisted over 400 fans from entering the stadiums by June 2018, with 32 other countries also sending officers to help local police screen attendees for valid ID cards.\n\nAllegations of corruption in the bidding processes and concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups led to threats from England\'s FA to boycott the tournament.They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and Sepp Blatter had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.FIFA appointed Michael J. Garcia, a US attorney, to investigate and produce a report on the corruption allegations.Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert.Eckert\'s summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert\'s absolving Russia from blame.Greg Dyke called for a re-examination of the affair and David Bernstein called for a boycott of the World Cup.Garcia criticised the summary as being ""materially incomplete"" with ""erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions"", and appealed to FIFA\'s Appeal Committee.The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned to protest of FIFA\'s conduct, citing a ""lack of leadership"" and lack of confidence in Eckert\'s independence.\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the FBI confirmed that federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.In an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA\'s Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that ""should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled"".Prince William of Wales and former British Prime Minister David Cameron attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in England was discussed.\n\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations—the 209 FIFA member associations except automatically qualified hosts Russia—applied to enter the qualifying process.Zimbabwe and Indonesia were later disqualified before playing their first matches, while Gibraltar and Kosovo, who joined FIFA on 13 May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.The first qualification game, between Timor-Leste and Mongolia, began in Dili on 12 March 2015 as part of the AFC\'s qualification, and the main qualifying draw took place at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, on 25 July 2015.\n\nOf the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2014.Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the smallest country in terms of population to reach the World Cup.Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments included: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, who last appeared in 1982; Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002.Poland, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Sweden have also returned after 12 years.It was the first time three Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four Arab nations (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.\n\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions Italy (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden and were the highest-ranked team to not qualify; and the Netherlands, who were three-time runners-up and had finished in third place in 2014, had qualified for the last three World Cups, and failed to qualify for their second major tournament in a row, missing out on the UEFA Euro 2016 as well.Four reigning continental champions: 2017 Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon; two-time Copa América champions and 2017 Confederations Cup runners-up Chile; 2016 OFC Nations Cup winners New Zealand; and 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup champions the United States (for the first time since 1986) also failed to qualify.The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Ghana and Ivory Coast, both of which had qualified for the three previous tournaments.The lowest-ranked team to qualify was the host nation, Russia.\n\nNote: Numbers in parentheses indicate positions in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the tournament.\n\nAFC (5) (36) (37) (61) (67) (57)\n\nCAF (5) (45) (41) (48) (27) (21)\n\nCONCACAF (3) (23) (15) (55)\n\nCONMEBOL (5) (5) (2) (16) (11) (14)\n\nOFC (0) None qualified\n\nUEFA (14) (3) (20) (joint 12) (joint 12) (7) (1) (22) (8) (4) (70) (hosts) (34) (10) (24) (6)\n\nThe draw was held on 1 December 2017 at 18:00 MSK at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow.The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, by selecting one team from each of the four ranked pots.\n\nFor the draw, the teams were allocated to four pots based entirely on the FIFA World Rankings of October 2017.Pot one contained the hosts Russia (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams.Pot two contained the next best eight teams, and so on for pots three and four.This was different from previous draws, when only pot one was based on FIFA rankings while the remaining pots were based on geographical considerations.However, teams from the same confederation still were not drawn against each other for the group stage, except that two UEFA teams could be in each group.The pots for the draw are shown below.\n\nInitially, each team had to name a preliminary squad of 30 players, but in February 2018 this was increased to 35.From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 23 players (three of whom had to be goalkeepers) by 4 June.Players in the final squad could be replaced for serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team\'s first match.These replacements did not need to have been named in the preliminary squad.\n\nFor players named in the 35-player preliminary squad, there was a mandatory rest period between 21 and 27 May 2018, except for those involved in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final played on 26 May.\n\nOn 29 March 2018, FIFA released the list of 36 referees and 63 assistant referees selected to oversee matches.On 30 April 2018, FIFA released the list of 13 video assistant referees, who acted solely in this capacity in the tournament.\n\nReferee Fahad Al-Mirdasi of Saudi Arabia was removed on 30 May 2018 over a match-fixing attempt, along with his two assistant referees, compatriots Mohammed Al-Abakry and Abdulah Al-Shalwai.A new referee was not appointed, but two assistant referees, Hasan Al Mahri of the United Arab Emirates and Hiroshi Yamauchi of Japan, were added to the list.Assistant referee Marwa Range of Kenya also withdrew after the BBC released an investigation conducted by a Ghanaian journalist which implicated him in a bribery scandal.\n\nShortly after the International Football Association Board\'s decision to incorporate video assistant referees (VARs) into the Laws of the game (LOTG) on 16 March 2018, the FIFA Council took the much-anticipated step of approving the use of VAR for the first time in a FIFA World Cup tournament.\n\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees.Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums\' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.\n\nVAR had a significant impact on several games.On 15 June 2018, Diego Costa\'s first goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision; the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16 June and resulted in a goal by Antoine Griezmann.A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, a phenomenon partially attributed to VAR.Overall, the new technology was both praised and criticised by commentators.FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.\n\nRussia proposed the following host cities: Kaliningrad, Kazan, Krasnodar, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg, Samara, Saransk, Sochi, Volgograd, Yaroslavl, and Yekaterinburg.Each chosen city was located in European Russia (except Yekaterinburg, which is located in Asia but lies very close to the Europe-Asia border) in order to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country.The bid evaluation report stated: ""The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA\'s minimum requirement.Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.""\n\nIn October 2011, Russia reduced the number of stadiums from 16 to 14.Construction of the proposed Podolsk stadium in the Moscow Oblast was cancelled by the regional government.Also, in the capital, Otkritie Arena was competing with Dynamo Stadium over which would be constructed first.\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29 September 2012.The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list.Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8 billion was spent on hosting the tournament.\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.He also said, ""We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums in South Africa, where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums"".\n\nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA\'s inspection committee and its head, Chris Unger, visited St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues.They were satisfied with the progress.On 8 October 2015, FIFA and the local organising committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums to be used during the tournament.Of the twelve venues, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium—the two largest stadiums in Russia—were used most; both hosted seven matches.Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara each hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Otkritie Stadium in Moscow and the Rostov Stadium hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each.Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk each hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\n\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Between 2010 (when Russia were announced as hosts) and 2018, nine of the twelve stadiums were built (some in place of older, outdated venues) and the other three were renovated for the tournament.Kaliningrad: Kaliningrad Stadium (new).The first piles were driven into the ground in September 2015.On 11 April 2018 it hosted its first match.Kazan: Kazan Arena (new).The stadium was built for the 2013 Summer Universiade.It has since hosted the 2015 World Aquatics Championships and the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup.It serves as a home arena for FC Rubin Kazan.Moscow: Luzhniki Stadium (heavily renovated).The largest stadium in the country, it was closed for renovation in 2013.It was commissioned in November 2017.Moscow: Spartak Stadium (new).This stadium is the home arena to its namesake FC Spartak Moscow.In accordance with FIFA requirements, during the 2018 World Cup, it was called Spartak Stadium instead of its usual name Otkritie Arena.It hosted its first match on 5 September 2014.Nizhny Novgorod: Nizhny Novgorod Stadium (new).Construction of this stadium commenced in 2015 and was completed in December 2017.Rostov-on-Don: Rostov Arena (new).The stadium is located on the left bank of the Don.Construction was completed on 22 December 2017.Saint Petersburg: Saint Petersburg Stadium (new).Construction commenced in 2007 after the site, formerly occupied by Kirov Stadium, was cleared.The project was officially completed on 29 December 2016.It has hosted 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup games and served as a venue for UEFA Euro 2020.Samara: Samara Arena (new).Construction officially started on 21 July 2014 and was completed on 21 April 2018.Saransk: Mordovia Arena (new).The stadium in Saransk was scheduled to be commissioned in 2012 in time for the opening of the all-Russian Spartakiad, but the plan was revised.The opening was rescheduled to 2017.The arena hosted its first match on 21 April 2018.Sochi: Fisht Stadium (slightly renovated).This stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics.Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup.Volgograd: Volgograd Arena (new).The main Volgograd arena was built on the demolished Central Stadium site, at the foot of the Mamayev Kurgan memorial complex.It was commissioned on 3 April 2018.Yekaterinburg: Ekaterinburg Arena (heavily renovated).The Central Stadium of Yekaterinburg had been renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Its stands have a capacity of 35,000 spectators.The renovation project was completed in December 2017.\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament.On 9 February 2018, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team.\n\nArgentina: Bronnitsy, Moscow Oblast Australia: Kazan, Tatarstan Belgium: Krasnogorsky, Moscow Oblast Brazil: Sochi, Krasnodar Krai Colombia: Verkhneuslonsky, Tatarstan Costa Rica: Saint Petersburg Croatia: Roshchino, Leningrad Oblast Denmark: Anapa,

over $14.2 billion , the 2018 FIFA event was the most expensive World Cup in history, surpassing the $11.6 billion cost of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.\n\nThe Russian government had originally earmarked a budget of around $20 billion, which was later slashed to $10 billion, for World Cup preparations.Half was spent on transportation infrastructure.As part of the program to prepare for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a federal sub-program—""Construction and Renovation of Transport Infrastructure""—was implemented with a total budget of ₽352.5 billion (rubles), with ₽170.3 billion coming from the federal budget, ₽35.1 billion from regional budgets, and ₽147.1 billion from investors.The biggest item of federal spending was the aviation infrastructure costing ₽117.8 billion.Construction of new hotels was a crucial area of infrastructure development in World Cup host cities.Costs continued to mount as preparations were underway.\n\nPlatov International Airport in Rostov-on-Don was upgraded with automated air traffic control systems.Modern surveillance, navigation, communication, control, and meteorological support systems were also installed.Koltsovo Airport in Yekaterinburg was upgraded with radio-engineering tools for flight operation and received a second runway.Saransk Airport received a new navigation system; two new hotels were constructed in the city—the Mercure Saransk Centre (Accor Hotels) and Four Points by Sheraton Saransk as well as few other smaller accommodation facilities.In Samara, new tram lines were laid.Khrabrovo Airport in Kaliningrad was upgraded with radio navigation and weather equipment.Renovation and upgraded radio-engineering tools for flight operations was completed in the Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Volgograd, Samara, Yekaterinburg, Kazan and Sochi airports.On 27 March, the Russian Ministry of Construction Industry, Housing and Utilities Sector of reported that all communications within its area of responsibility had been commissioned.The last facility commissioned was a waste treatment station in Volgograd.In Yekaterinburg, where four matches were hosted, hosting costs increased to over ₽7.4 billion, exceeding the ₽5.6 billion rubles originally allocated from the state and regional budget.\n\nVolunteer applications to the 2018 Russia Local Organising Committee opened on 1 June 2016.The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Volunteer Program received about 177,000 applications, and engaged a total of 35,000 volunteers.They received training at 15 Volunteer Centres of the local organising committee based in 15 universities, and in volunteer centres in the host cities.Preference, especially in key areas, was given to those with knowledge of a foreign language and volunteering experience, but not necessarily to Russian nationals.\n\nFree public transport services were offered for ticketholders during the World Cup, including additional trains linking host cities, as well as services such as bus services within them.\n\nThe full schedule was announced by FIFA on 24 July 2015 without kick-off times, which were confirmed later.On 1 December 2017, following the final draw, FIFA adjusted six kick-off times.\n\nRussia was placed in position A1 in the group stage and played in the opening match at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on 14 June against Saudi Arabia, the two lowest-ranked teams of the tournament at the time of the final draw.The Luzhniki Stadium also hosted the second semi-final on 11 July and the final on 15 July.The Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg hosted the first semi-final on 10 July and the third place play-off on 14 July.\n\nThe opening ceremony took place on Thursday, 14 June 2018, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, preceding the opening match of the tournament between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia.\n\nAt the start of the ceremony, Russian president Vladimir Putin gave a speech, welcoming the countries of the world to Russia and calling football a uniting force.Brazilian World Cup-winning striker Ronaldo entered the stadium with a child in a Russia jersey.Pop singer Robbie Williams then sang two of his songs solo before he and Russian soprano Aida Garifullina performed a duet.Dancers dressed in the flags of the 32 competing teams appeared carrying a sign with the name of each nation.At the end of the ceremony Ronaldo reappeared with the official match ball which had returned from the International Space Station in early June.\n\nYoung participants of the international children\'s social programme Football for Friendship from 211 countries and regions took part in the opening ceremony of the FIFA World Cup at the Luzhniki stadium.\n\nCompeting countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H).Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage.Ten European teams and four South American teams progressed to the knockout stage, together with Japan and Mexico.\n\nFor the first time since 1938, Germany, the reigning champions, were eliminated in the first round.This was the third consecutive tournament in which the holders were eliminated in the first round, after Italy in 2010 and Spain in 2014.No African team progressed to the second round for the first time since 1982.The fair play criteria came into use for the first time when Japan qualified over Senegal because the team had received fewer yellow cards.Only one match, France versus Denmark, was goalless.Until then there were a record 36 straight games in which at least one goal was scored.All times listed below are local time.\n\nIn the knockout stages, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winners.If a match went into extra time, each team was allowed to make a fourth substitution, the first time this had been allowed in a FIFA World Cup tournament.Below is the bracket for the knockout round of the tournament, teams in bold denote match winners.\n\nIn total, only four players were sent off in the entire tournament, the fewest since 1978.International Football Association Board technical director David Elleray stated a belief that this was due to the introduction of VAR, since players would know that they would not be able to get away with anything under the new system.\n\nA player is automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences: Receiving a red card (red card suspensions may be extended for serious offences)Receiving two yellow cards in two matches; yellow cards expire after the completion of the quarter-finals (yellow card suspensions are not carried forward to any other future international matches)\n\nThe following suspensions were served during the tournament:\n\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament.The Golden Boot (top scorer), Golden Ball (best overall player) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper) awards were all sponsored by Adidas.\n\nThe users of FIFA.com elected their Fan Dream Team.\n\nAdditionally, FIFA.com shortlisted 18 goals for users to vote on as the tournament\'s best.The poll closed on 23 July.The award was sponsored by Hyundai.\n\nFIFA published an All-Star Team, this year called the Fantasy Team, based on player performances evaluated through statistical data.\n\nPrize money amounts were announced in October 2017.\n\nThe tournament logo was unveiled on 28 October 2014 by cosmonauts at the International Space Station and then projected onto Moscow\'s Bolshoi Theatre during an evening television programme.Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said the logo was inspired by ""Russia\'s rich artistic tradition and its history of bold achievement and innovation"", and FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that it reflected the ""heart and soul"" of the country.For branding, Portuguese design agency Brandia Central created materials in 2014, with a typeface called Dusha – – designed by Brandia Central and edited by Adotbelow of the DSType Foundry in Portugal.\n\nThe first phase of ticket sales started on 14 September 2017, 12:00 Moscow Time, and lasted until 12 October 2017.\n\nThe general visa policy of Russia did not apply to participants and spectators, who were able to visit Russia without a visa right before and during the competition regardless of their citizenship.Spectators were nonetheless required to register for a ""Fan-ID"", a special photo identification pass.A Fan-ID was required to enter the country visa-free, while a ticket, Fan-ID and a valid passport were required to enter stadiums for matches.Fan-IDs also granted World Cup attendees free access to public transport services, including buses, and train service between host cities.Fan-ID was administered by the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, which could revoke this accreditation at any time to ""ensure the defence capability or security of the state or public order"".\n\nOn 29 May 2018, Electronic Arts released a free update to their video game FIFA 18 that added content related to the 2018 FIFA World Cup.The expansion included a World Cup tournament mode with all teams and stadiums from the event, official television presentation elements, and World Cup-related content for the Ultimate Team mode.\n\nPanini continued their partnership with FIFA by producing stickers for their World Cup sticker album.Panini also developed an app for the 2018 World Cup where fans could collect and swap virtual stickers, with 5 million fans gathering digital stickers for the tournament.\n\nThe tournament\'s official mascot was unveiled on 21 October 2016, and selected through a design competition among university students.A public vote was used to select the mascot from three finalists—a cat, a tiger, and a wolf.The winner, with 53% or approximately 1 million votes, was Zabivaka—an anthropomorphic wolf dressed in the colours of the Russian national team.Zabivaka\'s name is a portmanteau of the Russian words забияка (""hothead"") and забивать (""to score""), and his official backstory states that he is an aspiring football player who is ""charming, confident and social"".\n\nThe official match ball, the ""Telstar 18"", was unveiled on 9 November 2017.It was based on the name and design of the first Adidas World Cup ball from 1970.A special red-coloured variation, ""Telstar Mechta"", was used for the knockout stage of the tournament.The word mechta (Russian: мечта) means ""dream"" or ""ambition"".\n\nGoalkeepers noted that the ball was slippery and prone to having unpredictable trajectory.In addition, two Telstar 18 balls popped in the midst of a first-round match between France and Australia, leading to further discussions over the ball\'s performance.\n\nThe official song of the tournament was ""Live It Up"", with vocals by Will Smith, Nicky Jam and Era Istrefi, released on 25 May 2018.Its music video was released on 8 June 2018.\n\nThirty-three footballers who were alleged to be part of the Russian steroid programme are listed in the McLaren Report.On 22 December 2017, it was reported that FIFA had fired a doctor who had been investigating doping in Russian football.On 22 May 2018, FIFA stated that the investigations concerning all Russian players named for the provisional squad of the FIFA World Cup in Russia had been completed, with the result that insufficient evidence was found to support anti-doping rule violations.FIFA\'s medical committee also decided that Russian personnel would not be involved in performing drug testing procedures at the tournament, an action taken to reassure teams that samples would not be tampered with.\n\nRussia relaxed its visa rules during the World Cup, allowing Fan ID holders to enter and exit Russia without a visa through 31 December 2018.Traffickers exploited this system to bring foreign sex trafficking victims into the country, especially from Nigeria.Reuters had raised concerns about the victims\' conditions, who had allegedly been forced into prostitution, with some of them enduring violent abuse.Russian authorities were accused of doing little to fix to the issue, allegedly because many locals blamed the victims for falling into prostitution.\n\nIn response to the March 2018 poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, British prime minister Theresa May announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans.Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that the West are trying to ""take the World Cup out of Russia"".The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced Boris Johnson\'s statements that compared the event to the 1936 Olympics held in Nazi Germany as ""poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness"" and ""unacceptable and unworthy"" parallel towards Russia, a ""nation that lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism"".\n\nAt the close of the World Cup, Russia was widely praised for its success in hosting the tournament, with Steve Rosenberg of the BBC deeming it ""a resounding public relations success"" for Putin, adding: ""The stunning new stadiums, free train travel to venues and the absence of crowd violence has impressed visiting supporters.Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country\'s authoritarian image.All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised.""\n\nDespite the British Foreign Office and MPs repeatedly warning English football fans travelling to Russia of ""racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility"", fans who did travel said they received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino stated: ""Everyone discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, that is keen to show the world that everything that has been said before might not be true.A lot of preconceived ideas have been changed because people have seen the true nature of Russia.""Infantino has proclaimed Russia 2018 to be ""the best World Cup ever.""98 percent of the stadiums were sold out, there were 3 billion viewers on TV around the world and 7 million fans visited the fan fests.It was the most viewed World Cup to date, and the third most viewed television broadcast, surpassing the Beijing Olympics in 2008.\n\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters.After having tested the technology at limited matches of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the 2014 FIFA World Cup (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of Rio de Janeiro), the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in 4K ultra high definition.Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut of each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being converted up from 1080p high definition sources with limited degradation in quality.These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder UA:PBC stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup due to existing tensions with Russia amidst the Russo-Ukrainian War.This came in the wake of growing boycott of the tournament by the Football Federation of Ukraine and sports minister Ihor Zhdanov.Additionally, the FFU refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing diplomatic crisis in Qatar, which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar—the home country of FIFA\'s Middle East and Africa rightsholder beIN Sports—in June 2017, over its alleged state support of terrorist groups.On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from Du and Etisalat, but with service to the latter restored later that day.Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as ""beoutQ"".While FIFA attempted to negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final indirectly, they were unable to do so.On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had ""engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.""\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men\'s World Cup whose English rights were held by Fox Sports, and Spanish rights held by Telemundo.The elimination of the United States in the qualifiers led to concerns that U.S. interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that ""casual"" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5 million in 2014, and determined how much Fox paid for the rights.During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among Hispanic and Latino Americans.Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of tournament coverage.Viewership was down overall compared to 2014; match scheduling and time zones were not as favourable to viewers in the Americas as they were in 2014.Many games aired in the morning hours, although Telemundo\'s broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday daytime program in the network\'s history.\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, Korean Central Television acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea.Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time.In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to strained relations and campaigns against the country.\n\nA combined 3.572 billion unique viewers (live global 1-minute reach) – more than half of the global population aged four and over – tuned in to world football\'s ultimate competition, according to audience data for official broadcast coverage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe average global live audience for every game of the tournament was 191 million viewers (for a cumulative live audience of 12.224 billion viewers), a 2.1% increase over the 2014 tournament average of 187 million viewers, including that average audience in the early stages (group stage and round of 16) were bigger than in 2014.However, in 2018, the audience was 15 percent smaller for the semi-finals, 17 percent for the third place play-off, and 5.1 percent for the final, which was watched by 517 million people on average (only in-home TV viewers), compared to 545 million in 2014.Presumably, the reason for that is the smaller countries involved in the top four games compared to those in 2014, and only one global region (Europe) being represented in 2018 (compared to South America and Europe in 2014).However the live global 1-minute reach of the final was 1.12 billion people (884.37 in-home TV viewers and 231.82 million out-of-home and (or) digital-only viewers).\n\nFIFA World Cup FIFA World Cup hosts 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup 2019 FIFA Women\'s World Cup\n', 'Claim_Context': ""Croatian player Luka Modrić

9,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018 FIFA World Cup', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The 2018 FIFA World Cup was the 21st FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for national football teams organized by FIFA.It took place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in late 2010.It was the eleventh time the championships had been held in Europe, the first time they were held in Eastern Europe, and the first time they were held across two continents (Europe and Asia).At an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion, it was the most expensive World Cup ever held until it was surpassed by the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nThe tournament phase involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through qualifying competitions, while the host nation Russia qualified automatically.Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the 2014 event, while Iceland and Panama each made their debut at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities.Germany, the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage for the first time since 1938.Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals.In the final, France played Croatia on 15 July at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.France won the match 4–2, claiming their second World Cup and becoming the fourth consecutive title won by a European team, after Italy in 2006, Spain in 2010, and Germany in 2014.\n\nCroatian player Luka Modrić was voted the tournament\'s best player, winning the Golden Ball.England\'s Harry Kane won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals during the tournament with six.Belgium\'s Thibaut Courtois won the Golden Glove, awarded to the goalkeeper with the best performance.It has been estimated that more than 3 million people attended games during the tournament.\n\nThe bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest.Initially, nine countries placed bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico later withdrew from the proceedings, and Indonesia\'s bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian government failed to submit a letter to support the bid.During the bidding process, the three remaining non-UEFA nations (Australia, Japan, and the United States) gradually withdrew from the 2018 bids, and thus all UEFA nations were ruled out of the 2022 bid.As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.\n\nThe 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting.The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third.England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.\n\nThe voting results were:\n\nThe choice of Russia as host was controversial.Issues included the high level of racism in Russian football, human rights abuses by Russian authorities, and discrimination against LGBT people in government (including gay propaganda laws) along with wider Russian society.Russia\'s involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine had also prompted calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the annexation of Crimea.In 2014, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that ""the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work"".\n\nRussia was criticised for alleged abuse of migrant labourers in the construction of World Cup venues, with Human Rights Watch reporting cases where workers were left unpaid, made to work in dangerously cold conditions, or suffering reprisals for raising concerns.A few pundits claimed it was slave labour.In May 2017, FIFA president Gianni Infantino admitted there had been human rights abuses of North Korean workers involved in the construction of Saint Petersburg\'s Zenit Arena.By June 2017, at least 17 workers had died on World Cup construction sites, according to Building and Wood Workers\' International.In August, a group of eight US senators called on FIFA to consider dismissing Russia as the World Cup host if an independent investigation verified allegations of North Koreans being subjected to forced labor.\n\nRacism and Neo-nazi symbols displayed in the past by some Russian football fans drew criticism, with documented incidents of racial chants, banners spewing hate-filled messages, and sometimes assaults on people from the Caucasus and Central Asia.In March 2015, FIFA\'s then Vice President Jeffrey Webb said that Russia posed a huge challenge from a racism standpoint, and that a World Cup could not be held there under the current conditions.On July, United Nations anti-discrimination official Yuri Boychenko said that Russian soccer authorities had failed to fully grasp what racism was and needed to do more to combat it.To address this as well as concerns of hooliganism in general, Russian intelligence services blacklisted over 400 fans from entering the stadiums by June 2018, with 32 other countries also sending officers to help local police screen attendees for valid ID cards.\n\nAllegations of corruption in the bidding processes and concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups led to threats from England\'s FA to boycott the tournament.They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and Sepp Blatter had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.FIFA appointed Michael J. Garcia, a US attorney, to investigate and produce a report on the corruption allegations.Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert.Eckert\'s summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert\'s absolving Russia from blame.Greg Dyke called for a re-examination of the affair and David Bernstein called for a boycott of the World Cup.Garcia criticised the summary as being ""materially incomplete"" with ""erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions"", and appealed to FIFA\'s Appeal Committee.The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned to protest of FIFA\'s conduct, citing a ""lack of leadership"" and lack of confidence in Eckert\'s independence.\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the FBI confirmed that federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.In an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA\'s Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that ""should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled"".Prince William of Wales and former British Prime Minister David Cameron attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in England was discussed.\n\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations—the 209 FIFA member associations except automatically qualified hosts Russia—applied to enter the qualifying process.Zimbabwe and Indonesia were later disqualified before playing their first matches, while Gibraltar and Kosovo, who joined FIFA on 13 May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.The first qualification game, between Timor-Leste and Mongolia, began in Dili on 12 March 2015 as part of the AFC\'s qualification, and the main qualifying draw took place at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, on 25 July 2015.\n\nOf the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2014.Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the smallest country in terms of population to reach the World Cup.Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments included: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, who last appeared in 1982; Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002.Poland, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Sweden have also returned after 12 years.It was the first time three Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four Arab nations (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.\n\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions Italy (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden and were the highest-ranked team to not qualify; and the Netherlands, who were three-time runners-up and had finished in third place in 2014, had qualified for the last three World Cups, and failed to qualify for their second major tournament in a row, missing out on the UEFA Euro 2016 as well.Four reigning continental champions: 2017 Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon; two-time Copa América champions and 2017 Confederations Cup runners-up Chile; 2016 OFC Nations Cup winners New Zealand; and 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup champions the United States (for the first time since 1986) also failed to qualify.The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Ghana and Ivory Coast, both of which had qualified for the three previous tournaments.The lowest-ranked team to qualify was the host nation, Russia.\n\nNote: Numbers in parentheses indicate positions in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the tournament.\n\nAFC (5) (36) (37) (61) (67) (57)\n\nCAF (5) (45) (41) (48) (27) (21)\n\nCONCACAF (3) (23) (15)

December 2017 at 18:00 MSK at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow.The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, by selecting one team from each of the four ranked pots.\n\nFor the draw, the teams were allocated to four pots based entirely on the FIFA World Rankings of October 2017.Pot one contained the hosts Russia (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams.Pot two contained the next best eight teams, and so on for pots three and four.This was different from previous draws, when only pot one was based on FIFA rankings while the remaining pots were based on geographical considerations.However, teams from the same confederation still were not drawn against each other for the group stage, except that two UEFA teams could be in each group.The pots for the draw are shown below.\n\nInitially, each team had to name a preliminary squad of 30 players, but in February 2018 this was increased to 35.From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 23 players (three of whom had to be goalkeepers) by 4 June.Players in the final squad could be replaced for serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team\'s first match.These replacements did not need to have been named in the preliminary squad.\n\nFor players named in the 35-player preliminary squad, there was a mandatory rest period between 21 and 27 May 2018, except for those involved in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final played on 26 May.\n\nOn 29 March 2018, FIFA released the list of 36 referees and 63 assistant referees selected to oversee matches.On 30 April 2018, FIFA released the list of 13 video assistant referees, who acted solely in this capacity in the tournament.\n\nReferee Fahad Al-Mirdasi of Saudi Arabia was removed on 30 May 2018 over a match-fixing attempt, along with his two assistant referees, compatriots Mohammed Al-Abakry and Abdulah Al-Shalwai.A new referee was not appointed, but two assistant referees, Hasan Al Mahri of the United Arab Emirates and Hiroshi Yamauchi of Japan, were added to the list.Assistant referee Marwa Range of Kenya also withdrew after the BBC released an investigation conducted by a Ghanaian journalist which implicated him in a bribery scandal.\n\nShortly after the International Football Association Board\'s decision to incorporate video assistant referees (VARs) into the Laws of the game (LOTG) on 16 March 2018, the FIFA Council took the much-anticipated step of approving the use of VAR for the first time in a FIFA World Cup tournament.\n\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees.Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums\' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.\n\nVAR had a significant impact on several games.On 15 June 2018, Diego Costa\'s first goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision; the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16 June and resulted in a goal by Antoine Griezmann.A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, a phenomenon partially attributed to VAR.Overall, the new technology was both praised and criticised by commentators.FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.\n\nRussia proposed the following host cities: Kaliningrad, Kazan, Krasnodar, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg, Samara, Saransk, Sochi, Volgograd, Yaroslavl, and Yekaterinburg.Each chosen city was located in European Russia (except Yekaterinburg, which is located in Asia but lies very close to the Europe-Asia border) in order to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country.The bid evaluation report stated: ""The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA\'s minimum requirement.Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.""\n\nIn October 2011, Russia reduced the number of stadiums from 16 to 14.Construction of the proposed Podolsk stadium in the Moscow Oblast was cancelled by the regional government.Also, in the capital, Otkritie Arena was competing with Dynamo Stadium over which would be constructed first.\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29 September 2012.The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list.Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8 billion was spent on hosting the tournament.\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.He also said, ""We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums in South Africa, where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums"".\n\nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA\'s inspection committee and its head, Chris Unger, visited St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues.They were satisfied with the progress.On 8 October 2015, FIFA and the local organising committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums to be used during the tournament.Of the twelve venues, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium—the two largest stadiums in Russia—were used most; both hosted seven matches.Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara each hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Otkritie Stadium in Moscow and the Rostov Stadium hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each.Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk each hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\n\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Between 2010 (when Russia were announced as hosts) and 2018, nine of the twelve stadiums were built (some in place of older, outdated venues) and the other three were renovated for the tournament.Kaliningrad: Kaliningrad Stadium (new).The first piles were driven into the ground in September 2015.On 11 April 2018 it hosted its first match.Kazan: Kazan Arena (new).The stadium was built for the 2013 Summer Universiade.It has since hosted the 2015 World Aquatics Championships and the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup.It serves as a home arena for FC Rubin Kazan.Moscow: Luzhniki Stadium (heavily renovated).The largest stadium in the country, it was closed for renovation in 2013.It was commissioned in November 2017.Moscow: Spartak Stadium (new).This stadium is the home arena to its namesake FC Spartak Moscow.In accordance with FIFA requirements, during the 2018 World Cup, it was called Spartak Stadium instead of its usual name Otkritie Arena.It hosted its first match on 5 September 2014.Nizhny Novgorod: Nizhny Novgorod Stadium (new).Construction of this stadium commenced in 2015 and was completed in December 2017.Rostov-on-Don: Rostov Arena (new).The stadium is located on the left bank of the Don.Construction was completed on 22 December 2017.Saint Petersburg: Saint Petersburg Stadium (new).Construction commenced in 2007 after the site, formerly occupied by Kirov Stadium, was cleared.The project was officially completed on 29 December 2016.It has hosted 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup games and served as a venue for UEFA Euro 2020.Samara: Samara Arena (new).Construction officially started on 21 July 2014 and was completed on 21 April 2018.Saransk: Mordovia Arena (new).The stadium in Saransk was scheduled to be commissioned in 2012 in time for the opening of the all-Russian Spartakiad, but the plan was revised.The opening was rescheduled to 2017.The arena hosted its first match on 21 April 2018.Sochi: Fisht Stadium (slightly renovated).This stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics.Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup.Volgograd: Volgograd Arena (new).The main Volgograd arena was built on the demolished Central Stadium site, at the foot of the Mamayev Kurgan memorial complex.It was commissioned on 3 April 2018.Yekaterinburg: Ekaterinburg Arena (heavily renovated).The Central Stadium of Yekaterinburg had been renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Its stands have a capacity of 35,000 spectators.The renovation project was completed in December 2017.\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament.On 9 February 2018, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team.\n\nArgentina: Bronnitsy, Moscow Oblast Australia: Kazan, Tatarstan Belgium: Krasnogorsky, Moscow Oblast Brazil: Sochi, Krasnodar Krai Colombia: Verkhneuslonsky, Tatarstan Costa Rica: Saint Petersburg Croatia: Roshchino, Leningrad Oblast Denmark: Anapa,

over $14.2 billion , the 2018 FIFA event was the most expensive World Cup in history, surpassing the $11.6 billion cost of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.\n\nThe Russian government had originally earmarked a budget of around $20 billion, which was later slashed to $10 billion, for World Cup preparations.Half was spent on transportation infrastructure.As part of the program to prepare for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a federal sub-program—""Construction and Renovation of Transport Infrastructure""—was implemented with a total budget of ₽352.5 billion (rubles), with ₽170.3 billion coming from the federal budget, ₽35.1 billion from regional budgets, and ₽147.1 billion from investors.The biggest item of federal spending was the aviation infrastructure costing ₽117.8 billion.Construction of new hotels was a crucial area of infrastructure development in World Cup host cities.Costs continued to mount as preparations were underway.\n\nPlatov International Airport in Rostov-on-Don was upgraded with automated air traffic control systems.Modern surveillance, navigation, communication, control, and meteorological support systems were also installed.Koltsovo Airport in Yekaterinburg was upgraded with radio-engineering tools for flight operation and received a second runway.Saransk Airport received a new navigation system; two new hotels were constructed in the city—the Mercure Saransk Centre (Accor Hotels) and Four Points by Sheraton Saransk as well as few other smaller accommodation facilities.In Samara, new tram lines were laid.Khrabrovo Airport in Kaliningrad was upgraded with radio navigation and weather equipment.Renovation and upgraded radio-engineering tools for flight operations was completed in the Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Volgograd, Samara, Yekaterinburg, Kazan and Sochi airports.On 27 March, the Russian Ministry of Construction Industry, Housing and Utilities Sector of reported that all communications within its area of responsibility had been commissioned.The last facility commissioned was a waste treatment station in Volgograd.In Yekaterinburg, where four matches were hosted, hosting costs increased to over ₽7.4 billion, exceeding the ₽5.6 billion rubles originally allocated from the state and regional budget.\n\nVolunteer applications to the 2018 Russia Local Organising Committee opened on 1 June 2016.The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Volunteer Program received about 177,000 applications, and engaged a total of 35,000 volunteers.They received training at 15 Volunteer Centres of the local organising committee based in 15 universities, and in volunteer centres in the host cities.Preference, especially in key areas, was given to those with knowledge of a foreign language and volunteering experience, but not necessarily to Russian nationals.\n\nFree public transport services were offered for ticketholders during the World Cup, including additional trains linking host cities, as well as services such as bus services within them.\n\nThe full schedule was announced by FIFA on 24 July 2015 without kick-off times, which were confirmed later.On 1 December 2017, following the final draw, FIFA adjusted six kick-off times.\n\nRussia was placed in position A1 in the group stage and played in the opening match at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on 14 June against Saudi Arabia, the two lowest-ranked teams of the tournament at the time of the final draw.The Luzhniki Stadium also hosted the second semi-final on 11 July and the final on 15 July.The Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg hosted the first semi-final on 10 July and the third place play-off on 14 July.\n\nThe opening ceremony took place on Thursday, 14 June 2018, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, preceding the opening match of the tournament between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia.\n\nAt the start of the ceremony, Russian president Vladimir Putin gave a speech, welcoming the countries of the world to Russia and calling football a uniting force.Brazilian World Cup-winning striker Ronaldo entered the stadium with a child in a Russia jersey.Pop singer Robbie Williams then sang two of his songs solo before he and Russian soprano Aida Garifullina performed a duet.Dancers dressed in the flags of the 32 competing teams appeared carrying a sign with the name of each nation.At the end of the ceremony Ronaldo reappeared with the official match ball which had returned from the International Space Station in early June.\n\nYoung participants of the international children\'s social programme Football for Friendship from 211 countries and regions took part in the opening ceremony of the FIFA World Cup at the Luzhniki stadium.\n\nCompeting countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H).Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage.Ten European teams and four South American teams progressed to the knockout stage, together with Japan and Mexico.\n\nFor the first time since 1938, Germany, the reigning champions, were eliminated in the first round.This was the third consecutive tournament in which the holders were eliminated in the first round, after Italy in 2010 and Spain in 2014.No African team progressed to the second round for the first time since 1982.The fair play criteria came into use for the first time when Japan qualified over Senegal because the team had received fewer yellow cards.Only one match, France versus Denmark, was goalless.Until then there were a record 36 straight games in which at least one goal was scored.All times listed below are local time.\n\nIn the knockout stages, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winners.If a match went into extra time, each team was allowed to make a fourth substitution, the first time this had been allowed in a FIFA World Cup tournament.Below is the bracket for the knockout round of the tournament, teams in bold denote match winners.\n\nIn total, only four players were sent off in the entire tournament, the fewest since 1978.International Football Association Board technical director David Elleray stated a belief that this was due to the introduction of VAR, since players would know that they would not be able to get away with anything under the new system.\n\nA player is automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences: Receiving a red card (red card suspensions may be extended for serious offences)Receiving two yellow cards in two matches; yellow cards expire after the completion of the quarter-finals (yellow card suspensions are not carried forward to any other future international matches)\n\nThe following suspensions were served during the tournament:\n\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament.The Golden Boot (top scorer), Golden Ball (best overall player) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper) awards were all sponsored by Adidas.\n\nThe users of FIFA.com elected their Fan Dream Team.\n\nAdditionally, FIFA.com shortlisted 18 goals for users to vote on as the tournament\'s best.The poll closed on 23 July.The award was sponsored by Hyundai.\n\nFIFA published an All-Star Team, this year called the Fantasy Team, based on player performances evaluated through statistical data.\n\nPrize money amounts were announced in October 2017.\n\nThe tournament logo was unveiled on 28 October 2014 by cosmonauts at the International Space Station and then projected onto Moscow\'s Bolshoi Theatre during an evening television programme.Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said the logo was inspired by ""Russia\'s rich artistic tradition and its history of bold achievement and innovation"", and FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that it reflected the ""heart and soul"" of the country.For branding, Portuguese design agency Brandia Central created materials in 2014, with a typeface called Dusha – – designed by Brandia Central and edited by Adotbelow of the DSType Foundry in Portugal.\n\nThe first phase of ticket sales started on 14 September 2017, 12:00 Moscow Time, and lasted until 12 October 2017.\n\nThe general visa policy of Russia did not apply to participants and spectators, who were able to visit Russia without a visa right before and during the competition regardless of their citizenship.Spectators were nonetheless required to register for a ""Fan-ID"", a special photo identification pass.A Fan-ID was required to enter the country visa-free, while a ticket, Fan-ID and a valid passport were required to enter stadiums for matches.Fan-IDs also granted World Cup attendees free access to public transport services, including buses, and train service between host cities.Fan-ID was administered by the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, which could revoke this accreditation at any time to ""ensure the defence capability or security of the state or public order"".\n\nOn 29 May 2018, Electronic Arts released a free update to their video game FIFA 18 that added content related to the 2018 FIFA World Cup.The expansion included a World Cup tournament mode with all teams and stadiums from the event, official television presentation elements, and World Cup-related content for the Ultimate Team mode.\n\nPanini continued their partnership with FIFA by producing stickers for their World Cup sticker album.Panini also developed an app for the 2018 World Cup where fans could collect and swap virtual stickers, with 5 million fans gathering digital stickers for the tournament.\n\nThe tournament\'s official mascot was unveiled on 21 October 2016, and selected through a design competition among university students.A public vote was used to select the mascot from three finalists—a cat, a tiger, and a wolf.The winner, with 53% or approximately 1 million votes, was Zabivaka—an anthropomorphic wolf dressed in the colours of the Russian national team.Zabivaka\'s name is a portmanteau of the Russian words забияка (""hothead"") and забивать (""to score""), and his official backstory states that he is an aspiring football player who is ""charming, confident and social"".\n\nThe official match ball, the ""Telstar 18"", was unveiled on 9 November 2017.It was based on the name and design of the first Adidas World Cup ball from 1970.A special red-coloured variation, ""Telstar Mechta"", was used for the knockout stage of the tournament.The word mechta (Russian: мечта) means ""dream"" or ""ambition"".\n\nGoalkeepers noted that the ball was slippery and prone to having unpredictable trajectory.In addition, two Telstar 18 balls popped in the midst of a first-round match between France and Australia, leading to further discussions over the ball\'s performance.\n\nThe official song of the tournament was ""Live It Up"", with vocals by Will Smith, Nicky Jam and Era Istrefi, released on 25 May 2018.Its music video was released on 8 June 2018.\n\nThirty-three footballers who were alleged to be part of the Russian steroid programme are listed in the McLaren Report.On 22 December 2017, it was reported that FIFA had fired a doctor who had been investigating doping in Russian football.On 22 May 2018, FIFA stated that the investigations concerning all Russian players named for the provisional squad of the FIFA World Cup in Russia had been completed, with the result that insufficient evidence was found to support anti-doping rule violations.FIFA\'s medical committee also decided that Russian personnel would not be involved in performing drug testing procedures at the tournament, an action taken to reassure teams that samples would not be tampered with.\n\nRussia relaxed its visa rules during the World Cup, allowing Fan ID holders to enter and exit Russia without a visa through 31 December 2018.Traffickers exploited this system to bring foreign sex trafficking victims into the country, especially from Nigeria.Reuters had raised concerns about the victims\' conditions, who had allegedly been forced into prostitution, with some of them enduring violent abuse.Russian authorities were accused of doing little to fix to the issue, allegedly because many locals blamed the victims for falling into prostitution.\n\nIn response to the March 2018 poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, British prime minister Theresa May announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans.Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that the West are trying to ""take the World Cup out of Russia"".The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced Boris Johnson\'s statements that compared the event to the 1936 Olympics held in Nazi Germany as ""poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness"" and ""unacceptable and unworthy"" parallel towards Russia, a ""nation that lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism"".\n\nAt the close of the World Cup, Russia was widely praised for its success in hosting the tournament, with Steve Rosenberg of the BBC deeming it ""a resounding public relations success"" for Putin, adding: ""The stunning new stadiums, free train travel to venues and the absence of crowd violence has impressed visiting supporters.Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country\'s authoritarian image.All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised.""\n\nDespite the British Foreign Office and MPs repeatedly warning English football fans travelling to Russia of ""racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility"", fans who did travel said they received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino stated: ""Everyone discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, that is keen to show the world that everything that has been said before might not be true.A lot of preconceived ideas have been changed because people have seen the true nature of Russia.""Infantino has proclaimed Russia 2018 to be ""the best World Cup ever.""98 percent of the stadiums were sold out, there were 3 billion viewers on TV around the world and 7 million fans visited the fan fests.It was the most viewed World Cup to date, and the third most viewed television broadcast, surpassing the Beijing Olympics in 2008.\n\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters.After having tested the technology at limited matches of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the 2014 FIFA World Cup (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of Rio de Janeiro), the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in 4K ultra high definition.Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut of each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being converted up from 1080p high definition sources with limited degradation in quality.These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder UA:PBC stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup due to existing tensions with Russia amidst the Russo-Ukrainian War.This came in the wake of growing boycott of the tournament by the Football Federation of Ukraine and sports minister Ihor Zhdanov.Additionally, the FFU refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing diplomatic crisis in Qatar, which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar—the home country of FIFA\'s Middle East and Africa rightsholder beIN Sports—in June 2017, over its alleged state support of terrorist groups.On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from Du and Etisalat, but with service to the latter restored later that day.Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as ""beoutQ"".While FIFA attempted to negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final indirectly, they were unable to do so.On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had ""engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.""\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men\'s World Cup whose English rights were held by Fox Sports, and Spanish rights held by Telemundo.The elimination of the United States in the qualifiers led to concerns that U.S. interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that ""casual"" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5 million in 2014, and determined how much Fox paid for the rights.During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among Hispanic and Latino Americans.Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of tournament coverage.Viewership was down overall compared to 2014; match scheduling and time zones were not as favourable to viewers in the Americas as they were in 2014.Many games aired in the morning hours, although Telemundo\'s broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday daytime program in the network\'s history.\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, Korean Central Television acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea.Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time.In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to strained relations and campaigns against the country.\n\nA combined 3.572 billion unique viewers (live global 1-minute reach) – more than half of the global population aged four and over – tuned in to world football\'s ultimate competition, according to audience data for official broadcast coverage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe average global live audience for every game of the tournament was 191 million viewers (for a cumulative live audience of 12.224 billion viewers), a 2.1% increase over the 2014 tournament average of 187 million viewers, including that average audience in the early stages (group stage and round of 16) were bigger than in 2014.However, in 2018, the audience was 15 percent smaller for the semi-finals, 17 percent for the third place play-off, and 5.1 percent for the final, which was watched by 517 million people on average (only in-home TV viewers), compared to 545 million in 2014.Presumably, the reason for that is the smaller countries involved in the top four games compared to those in 2014, and only one global region (Europe) being represented in 2018 (compared to South America and Europe in 2014).However the live global 1-minute reach of the final was 1.12 billion people (884.37 in-home TV viewers and 231.82 million out-of-home and (or) digital-only viewers).\n\nFIFA World Cup FIFA World Cup hosts 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup 2019 FIFA Women\'s World Cup\n', 'Claim_Context': ""Croatian player Luka Modrić

10,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018 FIFA World Cup', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The 2018 FIFA World Cup was the 21st FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for national football teams organized by FIFA.It took place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in late 2010.It was the eleventh time the championships had been held in Europe, the first time they were held in Eastern Europe, and the first time they were held across two continents (Europe and Asia).At an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion, it was the most expensive World Cup ever held until it was surpassed by the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nThe tournament phase involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through qualifying competitions, while the host nation Russia qualified automatically.Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the 2014 event, while Iceland and Panama each made their debut at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities.Germany, the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage for the first time since 1938.Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals.In the final, France played Croatia on 15 July at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.France won the match 4–2, claiming their second World Cup and becoming the fourth consecutive title won by a European team, after Italy in 2006, Spain in 2010, and Germany in 2014.\n\nCroatian player Luka Modrić was voted the tournament\'s best player, winning the Golden Ball.England\'s Harry Kane won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals during the tournament with six.Belgium\'s Thibaut Courtois won the Golden Glove, awarded to the goalkeeper with the best performance.It has been estimated that more than 3 million people attended games during the tournament.\n\nThe bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest.Initially, nine countries placed bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico later withdrew from the proceedings, and Indonesia\'s bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian government failed to submit a letter to support the bid.During the bidding process, the three remaining non-UEFA nations (Australia, Japan, and the United States) gradually withdrew from the 2018 bids, and thus all UEFA nations were ruled out of the 2022 bid.As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.\n\nThe 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting.The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third.England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.\n\nThe voting results were:\n\nThe choice of Russia as host was controversial.Issues included the high level of racism in Russian football, human rights abuses by Russian authorities, and discrimination against LGBT people in government (including gay propaganda laws) along with wider Russian society.Russia\'s involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine had also prompted calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the annexation of Crimea.In 2014, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that ""the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work"".\n\nRussia was criticised for alleged abuse of migrant labourers in the construction of World Cup venues, with Human Rights Watch reporting cases where workers were left unpaid, made to work in dangerously cold conditions, or suffering reprisals for raising concerns.A few pundits claimed it was slave labour.In May 2017, FIFA president Gianni Infantino admitted there had been human rights abuses of North Korean workers involved in the construction of Saint Petersburg\'s Zenit Arena.By June 2017, at least 17 workers had died on World Cup construction sites, according to Building and Wood Workers\' International.In August, a group of eight US senators called on FIFA to consider dismissing Russia as the World Cup host if an independent investigation verified allegations of North Koreans being subjected to forced labor.\n\nRacism and Neo-nazi symbols displayed in the past by some Russian football fans drew criticism, with documented incidents of racial chants, banners spewing hate-filled messages, and sometimes assaults on people from the Caucasus and Central Asia.In March 2015, FIFA\'s then Vice President Jeffrey Webb said that Russia posed a huge challenge from a racism standpoint, and that a World Cup could not be held there under the current conditions.On July, United Nations anti-discrimination official Yuri Boychenko said that Russian soccer authorities had failed to fully grasp what racism was and needed to do more to combat it.To address this as well as concerns of hooliganism in general, Russian intelligence services blacklisted over 400 fans from entering the stadiums by June 2018, with 32 other countries also sending officers to help local police screen attendees for valid ID cards.\n\nAllegations of corruption in the bidding processes and concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups led to threats from England\'s FA to boycott the tournament.They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and Sepp Blatter had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.FIFA appointed Michael J. Garcia, a US attorney, to investigate and produce a report on the corruption allegations.Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert.Eckert\'s summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert\'s absolving Russia from blame.Greg Dyke called for a re-examination of the affair and David Bernstein called for a boycott of the World Cup.Garcia criticised the summary as being ""materially incomplete"" with ""erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions"", and appealed to FIFA\'s Appeal Committee.The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned to protest of FIFA\'s conduct, citing a ""lack of leadership"" and lack of confidence in Eckert\'s independence.\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the FBI confirmed that federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.In an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA\'s Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that ""should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled"".Prince William of Wales and former British Prime Minister David Cameron attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in England was discussed.\n\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations—the 209 FIFA member associations except automatically qualified hosts Russia—applied to enter the qualifying process.Zimbabwe and Indonesia were later disqualified before playing their first matches, while Gibraltar and Kosovo, who joined FIFA on 13 May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.The first qualification game, between Timor-Leste and Mongolia, began in Dili on 12 March 2015 as part of the AFC\'s qualification, and the main qualifying draw took place at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, on 25 July 2015.\n\nOf the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2014.Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the smallest country in terms of population to reach the World Cup.Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments included: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, who last appeared in 1982; Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002.Poland, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Sweden have also returned after 12 years.It was the first time three Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four Arab nations (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.\n\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions Italy (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden and were the highest-ranked team to not qualify; and the Netherlands, who were three-time runners-up and had finished in third place in 2014, had qualified for the last three World Cups, and failed to qualify for their second major tournament in a row, missing out on the UEFA Euro 2016 as well.Four reigning continental champions: 2017 Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon; two-time Copa América champions and 2017 Confederations Cup runners-up Chile; 2016 OFC Nations Cup winners New Zealand; and 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup champions the United States (for the first time since 1986) also failed to qualify.The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Ghana and Ivory Coast, both of which had qualified for the three previous tournaments.The lowest-ranked team to qualify was the host nation, Russia.\n\nNote: Numbers in parentheses indicate positions in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the tournament.\n\nAFC (5) (36) (37) (61) (67) (57)\n\nCAF (5) (45) (41) (48) (27) (21)\n\nCONCACAF (3) (23) (15)

December 2017 at 18:00 MSK at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow.The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, by selecting one team from each of the four ranked pots.\n\nFor the draw, the teams were allocated to four pots based entirely on the FIFA World Rankings of October 2017.Pot one contained the hosts Russia (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams.Pot two contained the next best eight teams, and so on for pots three and four.This was different from previous draws, when only pot one was based on FIFA rankings while the remaining pots were based on geographical considerations.However, teams from the same confederation still were not drawn against each other for the group stage, except that two UEFA teams could be in each group.The pots for the draw are shown below.\n\nInitially, each team had to name a preliminary squad of 30 players, but in February 2018 this was increased to 35.From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 23 players (three of whom had to be goalkeepers) by 4 June.Players in the final squad could be replaced for serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team\'s first match.These replacements did not need to have been named in the preliminary squad.\n\nFor players named in the 35-player preliminary squad, there was a mandatory rest period between 21 and 27 May 2018, except for those involved in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final played on 26 May.\n\nOn 29 March 2018, FIFA released the list of 36 referees and 63 assistant referees selected to oversee matches.On 30 April 2018, FIFA released the list of 13 video assistant referees, who acted solely in this capacity in the tournament.\n\nReferee Fahad Al-Mirdasi of Saudi Arabia was removed on 30 May 2018 over a match-fixing attempt, along with his two assistant referees, compatriots Mohammed Al-Abakry and Abdulah Al-Shalwai.A new referee was not appointed, but two assistant referees, Hasan Al Mahri of the United Arab Emirates and Hiroshi Yamauchi of Japan, were added to the list.Assistant referee Marwa Range of Kenya also withdrew after the BBC released an investigation conducted by a Ghanaian journalist which implicated him in a bribery scandal.\n\nShortly after the International Football Association Board\'s decision to incorporate video assistant referees (VARs) into the Laws of the game (LOTG) on 16 March 2018, the FIFA Council took the much-anticipated step of approving the use of VAR for the first time in a FIFA World Cup tournament.\n\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees.Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums\' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.\n\nVAR had a significant impact on several games.On 15 June 2018, Diego Costa\'s first goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision; the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16 June and resulted in a goal by Antoine Griezmann.A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, a phenomenon partially attributed to VAR.Overall, the new technology was both praised and criticised by commentators.FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.\n\nRussia proposed the following host cities: Kaliningrad, Kazan, Krasnodar, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg, Samara, Saransk, Sochi, Volgograd, Yaroslavl, and Yekaterinburg.Each chosen city was located in European Russia (except Yekaterinburg, which is located in Asia but lies very close to the Europe-Asia border) in order to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country.The bid evaluation report stated: ""The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA\'s minimum requirement.Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.""\n\nIn October 2011, Russia reduced the number of stadiums from 16 to 14.Construction of the proposed Podolsk stadium in the Moscow Oblast was cancelled by the regional government.Also, in the capital, Otkritie Arena was competing with Dynamo Stadium over which would be constructed first.\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29 September 2012.The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list.Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8 billion was spent on hosting the tournament.\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.He also said, ""We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums in South Africa, where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums"".\n\nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA\'s inspection committee and its head, Chris Unger, visited St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues.They were satisfied with the progress.On 8 October 2015, FIFA and the local organising committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums to be used during the tournament.Of the twelve venues, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium—the two largest stadiums in Russia—were used most; both hosted seven matches.Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara each hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Otkritie Stadium in Moscow and the Rostov Stadium hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each.Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk each hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\n\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Between 2010 (when Russia were announced as hosts) and 2018, nine of the twelve stadiums were built (some in place of older, outdated venues) and the other three were renovated for the tournament.Kaliningrad: Kaliningrad Stadium (new).The first piles were driven into the ground in September 2015.On 11 April 2018 it hosted its first match.Kazan: Kazan Arena (new).The stadium was built for the 2013 Summer Universiade.It has since hosted the 2015 World Aquatics Championships and the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup.It serves as a home arena for FC Rubin Kazan.Moscow: Luzhniki Stadium (heavily renovated).The largest stadium in the country, it was closed for renovation in 2013.It was commissioned in November 2017.Moscow: Spartak Stadium (new).This stadium is the home arena to its namesake FC Spartak Moscow.In accordance with FIFA requirements, during the 2018 World Cup, it was called Spartak Stadium instead of its usual name Otkritie Arena.It hosted its first match on 5 September 2014.Nizhny Novgorod: Nizhny Novgorod Stadium (new).Construction of this stadium commenced in 2015 and was completed in December 2017.Rostov-on-Don: Rostov Arena (new).The stadium is located on the left bank of the Don.Construction was completed on 22 December 2017.Saint Petersburg: Saint Petersburg Stadium (new).Construction commenced in 2007 after the site, formerly occupied by Kirov Stadium, was cleared.The project was officially completed on 29 December 2016.It has hosted 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup games and served as a venue for UEFA Euro 2020.Samara: Samara Arena (new).Construction officially started on 21 July 2014 and was completed on 21 April 2018.Saransk: Mordovia Arena (new).The stadium in Saransk was scheduled to be commissioned in 2012 in time for the opening of the all-Russian Spartakiad, but the plan was revised.The opening was rescheduled to 2017.The arena hosted its first match on 21 April 2018.Sochi: Fisht Stadium (slightly renovated).This stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics.Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup.Volgograd: Volgograd Arena (new).The main Volgograd arena was built on the demolished Central Stadium site, at the foot of the Mamayev Kurgan memorial complex.It was commissioned on 3 April 2018.Yekaterinburg: Ekaterinburg Arena (heavily renovated).The Central Stadium of Yekaterinburg had been renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Its stands have a capacity of 35,000 spectators.The renovation project was completed in December 2017.\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament.On 9 February 2018, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team.\n\nArgentina: Bronnitsy, Moscow Oblast Australia: Kazan,

over $14.2 billion , the 2018 FIFA event was the most expensive World Cup in history, surpassing the $11.6 billion cost of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.\n\nThe Russian government had originally earmarked a budget of around $20 billion, which was later slashed to $10 billion, for World Cup preparations.Half was spent on transportation infrastructure.As part of the program to prepare for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a federal sub-program—""Construction and Renovation of Transport Infrastructure""—was implemented with a total budget of ₽352.5 billion (rubles), with ₽170.3 billion coming from the federal budget, ₽35.1 billion from regional budgets, and ₽147.1 billion from investors.The biggest item of federal spending was the aviation infrastructure costing ₽117.8 billion.Construction of new hotels was a crucial area of infrastructure development in World Cup host cities.Costs continued to mount as preparations were underway.\n\nPlatov International Airport in Rostov-on-Don was upgraded with automated air traffic control systems.Modern surveillance, navigation, communication, control, and meteorological support systems were also installed.Koltsovo Airport in Yekaterinburg was upgraded with radio-engineering tools for flight operation and received a second runway.Saransk Airport received a new navigation system; two new hotels were constructed in the city—the Mercure Saransk Centre (Accor Hotels) and Four Points by Sheraton Saransk as well as few other smaller accommodation facilities.In Samara, new tram lines were laid.Khrabrovo Airport in Kaliningrad was upgraded with radio navigation and weather equipment.Renovation and upgraded radio-engineering tools for flight operations was completed in the Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Volgograd, Samara, Yekaterinburg, Kazan and Sochi airports.On 27 March, the Russian Ministry of Construction Industry, Housing and Utilities Sector of reported that all communications within its area of responsibility had been commissioned.The last facility commissioned was a waste treatment station in Volgograd.In Yekaterinburg, where four matches were hosted, hosting costs increased to over ₽7.4 billion, exceeding the ₽5.6 billion rubles originally allocated from the state and regional budget.\n\nVolunteer applications to the 2018 Russia Local Organising Committee opened on 1 June 2016.The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Volunteer Program received about 177,000 applications, and engaged a total of 35,000 volunteers.They received training at 15 Volunteer Centres of the local organising committee based in 15 universities, and in volunteer centres in the host cities.Preference, especially in key areas, was given to those with knowledge of a foreign language and volunteering experience, but not necessarily to Russian nationals.\n\nFree public transport services were offered for ticketholders during the World Cup, including additional trains linking host cities, as well as services such as bus services within them.\n\nThe full schedule was announced by FIFA on 24 July 2015 without kick-off times, which were confirmed later.On 1 December 2017, following the final draw, FIFA adjusted six kick-off times.\n\nRussia was placed in position A1 in the group stage and played in the opening match at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on 14 June against Saudi Arabia, the two lowest-ranked teams of the tournament at the time of the final draw.The Luzhniki Stadium also hosted the second semi-final on 11 July and the final on 15 July.The Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg hosted the first semi-final on 10 July and the third place play-off on 14 July.\n\nThe opening ceremony took place on Thursday, 14 June 2018, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, preceding the opening match of the tournament between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia.\n\nAt the start of the ceremony, Russian president Vladimir Putin gave a speech, welcoming the countries of the world to Russia and calling football a uniting force.Brazilian World Cup-winning striker Ronaldo entered the stadium with a child in a Russia jersey.Pop singer Robbie Williams then sang two of his songs solo before he and Russian soprano Aida Garifullina performed a duet.Dancers dressed in the flags of the 32 competing teams appeared carrying a sign with the name of each nation.At the end of the ceremony Ronaldo reappeared with the official match ball which had returned from the International Space Station in early June.\n\nYoung participants of the international children\'s social programme Football for Friendship from 211 countries and regions took part in the opening ceremony of the FIFA World Cup at the Luzhniki stadium.\n\nCompeting countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H).Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage.Ten European teams and four South American teams progressed to the knockout stage, together with Japan and Mexico.\n\nFor the first time since 1938, Germany, the reigning champions, were eliminated in the first round.This was the third consecutive tournament in which the holders were eliminated in the first round, after Italy in 2010 and Spain in 2014.No African team progressed to the second round for the first time since 1982.The fair play criteria came into use for the first time when Japan qualified over Senegal because the team had received fewer yellow cards.Only one match, France versus Denmark, was goalless.Until then there were a record 36 straight games in which at least one goal was scored.All times listed below are local time.\n\nIn the knockout stages, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winners.If a match went into extra time, each team was allowed to make a fourth substitution, the first time this had been allowed in a FIFA World Cup tournament.Below is the bracket for the knockout round of the tournament, teams in bold denote match winners.\n\nIn total, only four players were sent off in the entire tournament, the fewest since 1978.International Football Association Board technical director David Elleray stated a belief that this was due to the introduction of VAR, since players would know that they would not be able to get away with anything under the new system.\n\nA player is automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences: Receiving a red card (red card suspensions may be extended for serious offences)Receiving two yellow cards in two matches; yellow cards expire after the completion of the quarter-finals (yellow card suspensions are not carried forward to any other future international matches)\n\nThe following suspensions were served during the tournament:\n\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament.The Golden Boot (top scorer), Golden Ball (best overall player) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper) awards were all sponsored by Adidas.\n\nThe users of FIFA.com elected their Fan Dream Team.\n\nAdditionally, FIFA.com shortlisted 18 goals for users to vote on as the tournament\'s best.The poll closed on 23 July.The award was sponsored by Hyundai.\n\nFIFA published an All-Star Team, this year called the Fantasy Team, based on player performances evaluated through statistical data.\n\nPrize money amounts were announced in October 2017.\n\nThe tournament logo was unveiled on 28 October 2014 by cosmonauts at the International Space Station and then projected onto Moscow\'s Bolshoi Theatre during an evening television programme.Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said the logo was inspired by ""Russia\'s rich artistic tradition and its history of bold achievement and innovation"", and FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that it reflected the ""heart and soul"" of the country.For branding, Portuguese design agency Brandia Central created materials in 2014, with a typeface called Dusha – – designed by Brandia Central and edited by Adotbelow of the DSType Foundry in Portugal.\n\nThe first phase of ticket sales started on 14 September 2017, 12:00 Moscow Time, and lasted until 12 October 2017.\n\nThe general visa policy of Russia did not apply to participants and spectators, who were able to visit Russia without a visa right before and during the competition regardless of their citizenship.Spectators were nonetheless required to register for a ""Fan-ID"", a special photo identification pass.A Fan-ID was required to enter the country visa-free, while a ticket, Fan-ID and a valid passport were required to enter stadiums for matches.Fan-IDs also granted World Cup attendees free access to public transport services, including buses, and train service between host cities.Fan-ID was administered by the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, which could revoke this accreditation at any time to ""ensure the defence capability or security of the state or public order"".\n\nOn 29 May 2018, Electronic Arts released a free update to their video game FIFA 18 that added content related to the 2018 FIFA World Cup.The expansion included a World Cup tournament mode with all teams and stadiums from the event, official television presentation elements, and World Cup-related content for the Ultimate Team mode.\n\nPanini continued their partnership with FIFA by producing stickers for their World Cup sticker album.Panini also developed an app for the 2018 World Cup where fans could collect and swap virtual stickers, with 5 million fans gathering digital stickers for the tournament.\n\nThe tournament\'s official mascot was unveiled on 21 October 2016, and selected through a design competition among university students.A public vote was used to select the mascot from three finalists—a cat, a tiger, and a wolf.The winner, with 53% or approximately 1 million votes, was Zabivaka—an anthropomorphic wolf dressed in the colours of the Russian national team.Zabivaka\'s name is a portmanteau of the Russian words забияка (""hothead"") and забивать (""to score""), and his official backstory states that he is an aspiring football player who is ""charming, confident and social"".\n\nThe official match ball, the ""Telstar 18"", was unveiled on 9 November 2017.It was based on the name and design of the first Adidas World Cup ball from 1970.A special red-coloured variation, ""Telstar Mechta"", was used for the knockout stage of the tournament.The word mechta (Russian: мечта) means ""dream"" or ""ambition"".\n\nGoalkeepers noted that the ball was slippery and prone to having unpredictable trajectory.In addition, two Telstar 18 balls popped in the midst of a first-round match between France and Australia, leading to further discussions over the ball\'s performance.\n\nThe official song of the tournament was ""Live It Up"", with vocals by Will Smith, Nicky Jam and Era Istrefi, released on 25 May 2018.Its music video was released on 8 June 2018.\n\nThirty-three footballers who were alleged to be part of the Russian steroid programme are listed in the McLaren Report.On 22 December 2017, it was reported that FIFA had fired a doctor who had been investigating doping in Russian football.On 22 May 2018, FIFA stated that the investigations concerning all Russian players named for the provisional squad of the FIFA World Cup in Russia had been completed, with the result that insufficient evidence was found to support anti-doping rule violations.FIFA\'s medical committee also decided that Russian personnel would not be involved in performing drug testing procedures at the tournament, an action taken to reassure teams that samples would not be tampered with.\n\nRussia relaxed its visa rules during the World Cup, allowing Fan ID holders to enter and exit Russia without a visa through 31 December 2018.Traffickers exploited this system to bring foreign sex trafficking victims into the country, especially from Nigeria.Reuters had raised concerns about the victims\' conditions, who had allegedly been forced into prostitution, with some of them enduring violent abuse.Russian authorities were accused of doing little to fix to the issue, allegedly because many locals blamed the victims for falling into prostitution.\n\nIn response to the March 2018 poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, British prime minister Theresa May announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans.Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that the West are trying to ""take the World Cup out of Russia"".The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced Boris Johnson\'s statements that compared the event to the 1936 Olympics held in Nazi Germany as ""poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness"" and ""unacceptable and unworthy"" parallel towards Russia, a ""nation that lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism"".\n\nAt the close of the World Cup, Russia was widely praised for its success in hosting the tournament, with Steve Rosenberg of the BBC deeming it ""a resounding public relations success"" for Putin, adding: ""The stunning new stadiums, free train travel to venues and the absence of crowd violence has impressed visiting supporters.Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country\'s authoritarian image.All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised.""\n\nDespite the British Foreign Office and MPs repeatedly warning English football fans travelling to Russia of ""racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility"", fans who did travel said they received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino stated: ""Everyone discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, that is keen to show the world that everything that has been said before might not be true.A lot of preconceived ideas have been changed because people have seen the true nature of Russia.""Infantino has proclaimed Russia 2018 to be ""the best World Cup ever.""98 percent of the stadiums were sold out, there were 3 billion viewers on TV around the world and 7 million fans visited the fan fests.It was the most viewed World Cup to date, and the third most viewed television broadcast, surpassing the Beijing Olympics in 2008.\n\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters.After having tested the technology at limited matches of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the 2014 FIFA World Cup (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of Rio de Janeiro), the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in 4K ultra high definition.Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut of each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being converted up from 1080p high definition sources with limited degradation in quality.These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder UA:PBC stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup due to existing tensions with Russia amidst the Russo-Ukrainian War.This came in the wake of growing boycott of the tournament by the Football Federation of Ukraine and sports minister Ihor Zhdanov.Additionally, the FFU refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing diplomatic crisis in Qatar, which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar—the home country of FIFA\'s Middle East and Africa rightsholder beIN Sports—in June 2017, over its alleged state support of terrorist groups.On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from Du and Etisalat, but with service to the latter restored later that day.Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as ""beoutQ"".While FIFA attempted to negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final indirectly, they were unable to do so.On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had ""engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.""\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men\'s World Cup whose English rights were held by Fox Sports, and Spanish rights held by Telemundo.The elimination of the United States in the qualifiers led to concerns that U.S. interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that ""casual"" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5 million in 2014, and determined how much Fox paid for the rights.During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among Hispanic and Latino Americans.Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of tournament coverage.Viewership was down overall compared to 2014; match scheduling and time zones were not as favourable to viewers in the Americas as they were in 2014.Many games aired in the morning hours, although Telemundo\'s broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday daytime program in the network\'s history.\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, Korean Central Television acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea.Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time.In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to strained relations and campaigns against the country.\n\nA combined 3.572 billion unique viewers (live global 1-minute reach) – more than half of the global population aged four and over – tuned in to world football\'s ultimate competition, according to audience data for official broadcast coverage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe average global live audience for every game of the tournament was 191 million viewers (for a cumulative live audience of 12.224 billion viewers), a 2.1% increase over the 2014 tournament average of 187 million viewers, including that average audience in the early stages (group stage and round of 16) were bigger than in 2014.However, in 2018, the audience was 15 percent smaller for the semi-finals, 17 percent for the third place play-off, and 5.1 percent for the final, which was watched by 517 million people on average (only in-home TV viewers), compared to 545 million in 2014.Presumably, the reason for that is the smaller countries involved in the top four games compared to those in 2014, and only one global region (Europe) being represented in 2018 (compared to South America and Europe in 2014).However the live global 1-minute reach of the final was 1.12 billion people (884.37 in-home TV viewers and 231.82 million out-of-home and (or) digital-only viewers).\n\nFIFA World Cup FIFA World Cup hosts 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup 2019 FIFA Women\'s World Cup\n', 'Claim_Context': ""Croatian player Luka Modrić

11,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018 FIFA World Cup', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The 2018 FIFA World Cup was the 21st FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for national football teams organized by FIFA.It took place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in late 2010.It was the eleventh time the championships had been held in Europe, the first time they were held in Eastern Europe, and the first time they were held across two continents (Europe and Asia).At an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion, it was the most expensive World Cup ever held until it was surpassed by the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nThe tournament phase involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through qualifying competitions, while the host nation Russia qualified automatically.Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the 2014 event, while Iceland and Panama each made their debut at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities.Germany, the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage for the first time since 1938.Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals.In the final, France played Croatia on 15 July at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.France won the match 4–2, claiming their second World Cup and becoming the fourth consecutive title won by a European team, after Italy in 2006, Spain in 2010, and Germany in 2014.\n\nCroatian player Luka Modrić was voted the tournament\'s best player, winning the Golden Ball.England\'s Harry Kane won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals during the tournament with six.Belgium\'s Thibaut Courtois won the Golden Glove, awarded to the goalkeeper with the best performance.It has been estimated that more than 3 million people attended games during the tournament.\n\nThe bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest.Initially, nine countries placed bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico later withdrew from the proceedings, and Indonesia\'s bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian government failed to submit a letter to support the bid.During the bidding process, the three remaining non-UEFA nations (Australia, Japan, and the United States) gradually withdrew from the 2018 bids, and thus all UEFA nations were ruled out of the 2022 bid.As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.\n\nThe 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting.The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third.England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.\n\nThe voting results were:\n\nThe choice of Russia as host was controversial.Issues included the high level of racism in Russian football, human rights abuses by Russian authorities, and discrimination against LGBT people in government (including gay propaganda laws) along with wider Russian society.Russia\'s involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine had also prompted calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the annexation of Crimea.In 2014, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that ""the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work"".\n\nRussia was criticised for alleged abuse of migrant labourers in the construction of World Cup venues, with Human Rights Watch reporting cases where workers were left unpaid, made to work in dangerously cold conditions, or suffering reprisals for raising concerns.A few pundits claimed it was slave labour.In May 2017, FIFA president Gianni Infantino admitted there had been human rights abuses of North Korean workers involved in the construction of Saint Petersburg\'s Zenit Arena.By June 2017, at least 17 workers had died on World Cup construction sites, according to Building and Wood Workers\' International.In August, a group of eight US senators called on FIFA to consider dismissing Russia as the World Cup host if an independent investigation verified allegations of North Koreans being subjected to forced labor.\n\nRacism and Neo-nazi symbols displayed in the past by some Russian football fans drew criticism, with documented incidents of racial chants, banners spewing hate-filled messages, and sometimes assaults on people from the Caucasus and Central Asia.In March 2015, FIFA\'s then Vice President Jeffrey Webb said that Russia posed a huge challenge from a racism standpoint, and that a World Cup could not be held there under the current conditions.On July, United Nations anti-discrimination official Yuri Boychenko said that Russian soccer authorities had failed to fully grasp what racism was and needed to do more to combat it.To address this as well as concerns of hooliganism in general, Russian intelligence services blacklisted over 400 fans from entering the stadiums by June 2018, with 32 other countries also sending officers to help local police screen attendees for valid ID cards.\n\nAllegations of corruption in the bidding processes and concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups led to threats from England\'s FA to boycott the tournament.They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and Sepp Blatter had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.FIFA appointed Michael J. Garcia, a US attorney, to investigate and produce a report on the corruption allegations.Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert.Eckert\'s summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert\'s absolving Russia from blame.Greg Dyke called for a re-examination of the affair and David Bernstein called for a boycott of the World Cup.Garcia criticised the summary as being ""materially incomplete"" with ""erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions"", and appealed to FIFA\'s Appeal Committee.The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned to protest of FIFA\'s conduct, citing a ""lack of leadership"" and lack of confidence in Eckert\'s independence.\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the FBI confirmed that federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.In an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA\'s Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that ""should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled"".Prince William of Wales and former British Prime Minister David Cameron attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in England was discussed.\n\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations—the 209 FIFA member associations except automatically qualified hosts Russia—applied to enter the qualifying process.Zimbabwe and Indonesia were later disqualified before playing their first matches, while Gibraltar and Kosovo, who joined FIFA on 13 May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.The first qualification game, between Timor-Leste and Mongolia, began in Dili on 12 March 2015 as part of the AFC\'s qualification, and the main qualifying draw took place at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, on 25 July 2015.\n\nOf the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2014.Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the smallest country in terms of population to reach the World Cup.Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments included: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, who last appeared in 1982; Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002.Poland, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Sweden have also returned after 12 years.It was the first time three Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four Arab nations (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.\n\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions Italy (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden and were the highest-ranked team to not qualify; and the Netherlands, who were three-time runners-up and had finished in third place in 2014, had qualified for the last three World Cups, and failed to qualify for their second major tournament in a row, missing out on the UEFA Euro 2016 as well.Four reigning continental champions: 2017 Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon; two-time Copa América champions and 2017 Confederations Cup runners-up Chile; 2016 OFC Nations Cup winners New Zealand; and 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup champions the United States (for the first time since 1986) also failed to qualify.The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Ghana and Ivory Coast, both of which had qualified for the three previous tournaments.The lowest-ranked team to qualify was the host nation, Russia.\n\nNote: Numbers in parentheses indicate positions in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the tournament.\n\nAFC (5) (36) (37) (61) (67) (57)\n\nCAF (5) (45) (41) (48) (27) (21)\n\nCONCACAF (3) (23) (15)

December 2017 at 18:00 MSK at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow.The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, by selecting one team from each of the four ranked pots.\n\nFor the draw, the teams were allocated to four pots based entirely on the FIFA World Rankings of October 2017.Pot one contained the hosts Russia (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams.Pot two contained the next best eight teams, and so on for pots three and four.This was different from previous draws, when only pot one was based on FIFA rankings while the remaining pots were based on geographical considerations.However, teams from the same confederation still were not drawn against each other for the group stage, except that two UEFA teams could be in each group.The pots for the draw are shown below.\n\nInitially, each team had to name a preliminary squad of 30 players, but in February 2018 this was increased to 35.From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 23 players (three of whom had to be goalkeepers) by 4 June.Players in the final squad could be replaced for serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team\'s first match.These replacements did not need to have been named in the preliminary squad.\n\nFor players named in the 35-player preliminary squad, there was a mandatory rest period between 21 and 27 May 2018, except for those involved in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final played on 26 May.\n\nOn 29 March 2018, FIFA released the list of 36 referees and 63 assistant referees selected to oversee matches.On 30 April 2018, FIFA released the list of 13 video assistant referees, who acted solely in this capacity in the tournament.\n\nReferee Fahad Al-Mirdasi of Saudi Arabia was removed on 30 May 2018 over a match-fixing attempt, along with his two assistant referees, compatriots Mohammed Al-Abakry and Abdulah Al-Shalwai.A new referee was not appointed, but two assistant referees, Hasan Al Mahri of the United Arab Emirates and Hiroshi Yamauchi of Japan, were added to the list.Assistant referee Marwa Range of Kenya also withdrew after the BBC released an investigation conducted by a Ghanaian journalist which implicated him in a bribery scandal.\n\nShortly after the International Football Association Board\'s decision to incorporate video assistant referees (VARs) into the Laws of the game (LOTG) on 16 March 2018, the FIFA Council took the much-anticipated step of approving the use of VAR for the first time in a FIFA World Cup tournament.\n\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees.Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums\' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.\n\nVAR had a significant impact on several games.On 15 June 2018, Diego Costa\'s first goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision; the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16 June and resulted in a goal by Antoine Griezmann.A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, a phenomenon partially attributed to VAR.Overall, the new technology was both praised and criticised by commentators.FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.\n\nRussia proposed the following host cities: Kaliningrad, Kazan, Krasnodar, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg, Samara, Saransk, Sochi, Volgograd, Yaroslavl, and Yekaterinburg.Each chosen city was located in European Russia (except Yekaterinburg, which is located in Asia but lies very close to the Europe-Asia border) in order to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country.The bid evaluation report stated: ""The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA\'s minimum requirement.Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.""\n\nIn October 2011, Russia reduced the number of stadiums from 16 to 14.Construction of the proposed Podolsk stadium in the Moscow Oblast was cancelled by the regional government.Also, in the capital, Otkritie Arena was competing with Dynamo Stadium over which would be constructed first.\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29 September 2012.The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list.Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8 billion was spent on hosting the tournament.\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.He also said, ""We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums in South Africa, where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums"".\n\nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA\'s inspection committee and its head, Chris Unger, visited St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues.They were satisfied with the progress.On 8 October 2015, FIFA and the local organising committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums to be used during the tournament.Of the twelve venues, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium—the two largest stadiums in Russia—were used most; both hosted seven matches.Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara each hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Otkritie Stadium in Moscow and the Rostov Stadium hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each.Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk each hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\n\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Between 2010 (when Russia were announced as hosts) and 2018, nine of the twelve stadiums were built (some in place of older, outdated venues) and the other three were renovated for the tournament.Kaliningrad: Kaliningrad Stadium (new).The first piles were driven into the ground in September 2015.On 11 April 2018 it hosted its first match.Kazan: Kazan Arena (new).The stadium was built for the 2013 Summer Universiade.It has since hosted the 2015 World Aquatics Championships and the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup.It serves as a home arena for FC Rubin Kazan.Moscow: Luzhniki Stadium (heavily renovated).The largest stadium in the country, it was closed for renovation in 2013.It was commissioned in November 2017.Moscow: Spartak Stadium (new).This stadium is the home arena to its namesake FC Spartak Moscow.In accordance with FIFA requirements, during the 2018 World Cup, it was called Spartak Stadium instead of its usual name Otkritie Arena.It hosted its first match on 5 September 2014.Nizhny Novgorod: Nizhny Novgorod Stadium (new).Construction of this stadium commenced in 2015 and was completed in December 2017.Rostov-on-Don: Rostov Arena (new).The stadium is located on the left bank of the Don.Construction was completed on 22 December 2017.Saint Petersburg: Saint Petersburg Stadium (new).Construction commenced in 2007 after the site, formerly occupied by Kirov Stadium, was cleared.The project was officially completed on 29 December 2016.It has hosted 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup games and served as a venue for UEFA Euro 2020.Samara: Samara Arena (new).Construction officially started on 21 July 2014 and was completed on 21 April 2018.Saransk: Mordovia Arena (new).The stadium in Saransk was scheduled to be commissioned in 2012 in time for the opening of the all-Russian Spartakiad, but the plan was revised.The opening was rescheduled to 2017.The arena hosted its first match on 21 April 2018.Sochi: Fisht Stadium (slightly renovated).This stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics.Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup.Volgograd: Volgograd Arena (new).The main Volgograd arena was built on the demolished Central Stadium site, at the foot of the Mamayev Kurgan memorial complex.It was commissioned on 3 April 2018.Yekaterinburg: Ekaterinburg Arena (heavily renovated).The Central Stadium of Yekaterinburg had been renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Its stands have a capacity of 35,000 spectators.The renovation project was completed in December 2017.\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament.On 9 February 2018, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team.\n\nArgentina: Bronnitsy, Moscow Oblast Australia: Kazan, Tatarstan Belgium: Krasnogorsky, Moscow Oblast Brazil: Sochi, Krasnodar Krai Colombia: Verkhneuslonsky, Tatarstan Costa Rica: Saint Petersburg Croatia: Roshchino, Leningrad Oblast Denmark: Anapa,

over $14.2 billion , the 2018 FIFA event was the most expensive World Cup in history, surpassing the $11.6 billion cost of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.\n\nThe Russian government had originally earmarked a budget of around $20 billion, which was later slashed to $10 billion, for World Cup preparations.Half was spent on transportation infrastructure.As part of the program to prepare for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a federal sub-program—""Construction and Renovation of Transport Infrastructure""—was implemented with a total budget of ₽352.5 billion (rubles), with ₽170.3 billion coming from the federal budget, ₽35.1 billion from regional budgets, and ₽147.1 billion from investors.The biggest item of federal spending was the aviation infrastructure costing ₽117.8 billion.Construction of new hotels was a crucial area of infrastructure development in World Cup host cities.Costs continued to mount as preparations were underway.\n\nPlatov International Airport in Rostov-on-Don was upgraded with automated air traffic control systems.Modern surveillance, navigation, communication, control, and meteorological support systems were also installed.Koltsovo Airport in Yekaterinburg was upgraded with radio-engineering tools for flight operation and received a second runway.Saransk Airport received a new navigation system; two new hotels were constructed in the city—the Mercure Saransk Centre (Accor Hotels) and Four Points by Sheraton Saransk as well as few other smaller accommodation facilities.In Samara, new tram lines were laid.Khrabrovo Airport in Kaliningrad was upgraded with radio navigation and weather equipment.Renovation and upgraded radio-engineering tools for flight operations was completed in the Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Volgograd, Samara, Yekaterinburg, Kazan and Sochi airports.On 27 March, the Russian Ministry of Construction Industry, Housing and Utilities Sector of reported that all communications within its area of responsibility had been commissioned.The last facility commissioned was a waste treatment station in Volgograd.In Yekaterinburg, where four matches were hosted, hosting costs increased to over ₽7.4 billion, exceeding the ₽5.6 billion rubles originally allocated from the state and regional budget.\n\nVolunteer applications to the 2018 Russia Local Organising Committee opened on 1 June 2016.The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Volunteer Program received about 177,000 applications, and engaged a total of 35,000 volunteers.They received training at 15 Volunteer Centres of the local organising committee based in 15 universities, and in volunteer centres in the host cities.Preference, especially in key areas, was given to those with knowledge of a foreign language and volunteering experience, but not necessarily to Russian nationals.\n\nFree public transport services were offered for ticketholders during the World Cup, including additional trains linking host cities, as well as services such as bus services within them.\n\nThe full schedule was announced by FIFA on 24 July 2015 without kick-off times, which were confirmed later.On 1 December 2017, following the final draw, FIFA adjusted six kick-off times.\n\nRussia was placed in position A1 in the group stage and played in the opening match at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on 14 June against Saudi Arabia, the two lowest-ranked teams of the tournament at the time of the final draw.The Luzhniki Stadium also hosted the second semi-final on 11 July and the final on 15 July.The Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg hosted the first semi-final on 10 July and the third place play-off on 14 July.\n\nThe opening ceremony took place on Thursday, 14 June 2018, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, preceding the opening match of the tournament between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia.\n\nAt the start of the ceremony, Russian president Vladimir Putin gave a speech, welcoming the countries of the world to Russia and calling football a uniting force.Brazilian World Cup-winning striker Ronaldo entered the stadium with a child in a Russia jersey.Pop singer Robbie Williams then sang two of his songs solo before he and Russian soprano Aida Garifullina performed a duet.Dancers dressed in the flags of the 32 competing teams appeared carrying a sign with the name of each nation.At the end of the ceremony Ronaldo reappeared with the official match ball which had returned from the International Space Station in early June.\n\nYoung participants of the international children\'s social programme Football for Friendship from 211 countries and regions took part in the opening ceremony of the FIFA World Cup at the Luzhniki stadium.\n\nCompeting countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H).Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage.Ten European teams and four South American teams progressed to the knockout stage, together with Japan and Mexico.\n\nFor the first time since 1938, Germany, the reigning champions, were eliminated in the first round.This was the third consecutive tournament in which the holders were eliminated in the first round, after Italy in 2010 and Spain in 2014.No African team progressed to the second round for the first time since 1982.The fair play criteria came into use for the first time when Japan qualified over Senegal because the team had received fewer yellow cards.Only one match, France versus Denmark, was goalless.Until then there were a record 36 straight games in which at least one goal was scored.All times listed below are local time.\n\nIn the knockout stages, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winners.If a match went into extra time, each team was allowed to make a fourth substitution, the first time this had been allowed in a FIFA World Cup tournament.Below is the bracket for the knockout round of the tournament, teams in bold denote match winners.\n\nIn total, only four players were sent off in the entire tournament, the fewest since 1978.International Football Association Board technical director David Elleray stated a belief that this was due to the introduction of VAR, since players would know that they would not be able to get away with anything under the new system.\n\nA player is automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences: Receiving a red card (red card suspensions may be extended for serious offences)Receiving two yellow cards in two matches; yellow cards expire after the completion of the quarter-finals (yellow card suspensions are not carried forward to any other future international matches)\n\nThe following suspensions were served during the tournament:\n\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament.The Golden Boot (top scorer), Golden Ball (best overall player) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper) awards were all sponsored by Adidas.\n\nThe users of FIFA.com elected their Fan Dream Team.\n\nAdditionally, FIFA.com shortlisted 18 goals for users to vote on as the tournament\'s best.The poll closed on 23 July.The award was sponsored by Hyundai.\n\nFIFA published an All-Star Team, this year called the Fantasy Team, based on player performances evaluated through statistical data.\n\nPrize money amounts were announced in October 2017.\n\nThe tournament logo was unveiled on 28 October 2014 by cosmonauts at the International Space Station and then projected onto Moscow\'s Bolshoi Theatre during an evening television programme.Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said the logo was inspired by ""Russia\'s rich artistic tradition and its history of bold achievement and innovation"", and FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that it reflected the ""heart and soul"" of the country.For branding, Portuguese design agency Brandia Central created materials in 2014, with a typeface called Dusha – – designed by Brandia Central and edited by Adotbelow of the DSType Foundry in Portugal.\n\nThe first phase of ticket sales started on 14 September 2017, 12:00 Moscow Time, and lasted until 12 October 2017.\n\nThe general visa policy of Russia did not apply to participants and spectators, who were able to visit Russia without a visa right before and during the competition regardless of their citizenship.Spectators were nonetheless required to register for a ""Fan-ID"", a special photo identification pass.A Fan-ID was required to enter the country visa-free, while a ticket, Fan-ID and a valid passport were required to enter stadiums for matches.Fan-IDs also granted World Cup attendees free access to public transport services, including buses, and train service between host cities.Fan-ID was administered by the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, which could revoke this accreditation at any time to ""ensure the defence capability or security of the state or public order"".\n\nOn 29 May 2018, Electronic Arts released a free update to their video game FIFA 18 that added content related to the 2018 FIFA World Cup.The expansion included a World Cup tournament mode with all teams and stadiums from the event, official television presentation elements, and World Cup-related content for the Ultimate Team mode.\n\nPanini continued their partnership with FIFA by producing stickers for their World Cup sticker album.Panini also developed an app for the 2018 World Cup where fans could collect and swap virtual stickers, with 5 million fans gathering digital stickers for the tournament.\n\nThe tournament\'s official mascot was unveiled on 21 October 2016, and selected through a design competition among university students.A public vote was used to select the mascot from three finalists—a cat, a tiger, and a wolf.The winner, with 53% or approximately 1 million votes, was Zabivaka—an anthropomorphic wolf dressed in the colours of the Russian national team.Zabivaka\'s name is a portmanteau of the Russian words забияка (""hothead"") and забивать (""to score""), and his official backstory states that he is an aspiring football player who is ""charming, confident and social"".\n\nThe official match ball, the ""Telstar 18"", was unveiled on 9 November 2017.It was based on the name and design of the first Adidas World Cup ball from 1970.A special red-coloured variation, ""Telstar Mechta"", was used for the knockout stage of the tournament.The word mechta (Russian: мечта) means ""dream"" or ""ambition"".\n\nGoalkeepers noted that the ball was slippery and prone to having unpredictable trajectory.In addition, two Telstar 18 balls popped in the midst of a first-round match between France and Australia, leading to further discussions over the ball\'s performance.\n\nThe official song of the tournament was ""Live It Up"", with vocals by Will Smith, Nicky Jam and Era Istrefi, released on 25 May 2018.Its music video was released on 8 June 2018.\n\nThirty-three footballers who were alleged to be part of the Russian steroid programme are listed in the McLaren Report.On 22 December 2017, it was reported that FIFA had fired a doctor who had been investigating doping in Russian football.On 22 May 2018, FIFA stated that the investigations concerning all Russian players named for the provisional squad of the FIFA World Cup in Russia had been completed, with the result that insufficient evidence was found to support anti-doping rule violations.FIFA\'s medical committee also decided that Russian personnel would not be involved in performing drug testing procedures at the tournament, an action taken to reassure teams that samples would not be tampered with.\n\nRussia relaxed its visa rules during the World Cup, allowing Fan ID holders to enter and exit Russia without a visa through 31 December 2018.Traffickers exploited this system to bring foreign sex trafficking victims into the country, especially from Nigeria.Reuters had raised concerns about the victims\' conditions, who had allegedly been forced into prostitution, with some of them enduring violent abuse.Russian authorities were accused of doing little to fix to the issue, allegedly because many locals blamed the victims for falling into prostitution.\n\nIn response to the March 2018 poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, British prime minister Theresa May announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans.Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that the West are trying to ""take the World Cup out of Russia"".The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced Boris Johnson\'s statements that compared the event to the 1936 Olympics held in Nazi Germany as ""poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness"" and ""unacceptable and unworthy"" parallel towards Russia, a ""nation that lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism"".\n\nAt the close of the World Cup, Russia was widely praised for its success in hosting the tournament, with Steve Rosenberg of the BBC deeming it ""a resounding public relations success"" for Putin, adding: ""The stunning new stadiums, free train travel to venues and the absence of crowd violence has impressed visiting supporters.Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country\'s authoritarian image.All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised.""\n\nDespite the British Foreign Office and MPs repeatedly warning English football fans travelling to Russia of ""racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility"", fans who did travel said they received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino stated: ""Everyone discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, that is keen to show the world that everything that has been said before might not be true.A lot of preconceived ideas have been changed because people have seen the true nature of Russia.""Infantino has proclaimed Russia 2018 to be ""the best World Cup ever.""98 percent of the stadiums were sold out, there were 3 billion viewers on TV around the world and 7 million fans visited the fan fests.It was the most viewed World Cup to date, and the third most viewed television broadcast, surpassing the Beijing Olympics in 2008.\n\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters.After having tested the technology at limited matches of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the 2014 FIFA World Cup (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of Rio de Janeiro), the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in 4K ultra high definition.Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut of each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being converted up from 1080p high definition sources with limited degradation in quality.These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder UA:PBC stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup due to existing tensions with Russia amidst the Russo-Ukrainian War.This came in the wake of growing boycott of the tournament by the Football Federation of Ukraine and sports minister Ihor Zhdanov.Additionally, the FFU refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing diplomatic crisis in Qatar, which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar—the home country of FIFA\'s Middle East and Africa rightsholder beIN Sports—in June 2017, over its alleged state support of terrorist groups.On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from Du and Etisalat, but with service to the latter restored later that day.Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as ""beoutQ"".While FIFA attempted to negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final indirectly, they were unable to do so.On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had ""engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.""\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men\'s World Cup whose English rights were held by Fox Sports, and Spanish rights held by Telemundo.The elimination of the United States in the qualifiers led to concerns that U.S. interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that ""casual"" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5 million in 2014, and determined how much Fox paid for the rights.During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among Hispanic and Latino Americans.Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of tournament coverage.Viewership was down overall compared to 2014; match scheduling and time zones were not as favourable to viewers in the Americas as they were in 2014.Many games aired in the morning hours, although Telemundo\'s broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday daytime program in the network\'s history.\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, Korean Central Television acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea.Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time.In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to strained relations and campaigns against the country.\n\nA combined 3.572 billion unique viewers (live global 1-minute reach) – more than half of the global population aged four and over – tuned in to world football\'s ultimate competition, according to audience data for official broadcast coverage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe average global live audience for every game of the tournament was 191 million viewers (for a cumulative live audience of 12.224 billion viewers), a 2.1% increase over the 2014 tournament average of 187 million viewers, including that average audience in the early stages (group stage and round of 16) were bigger than in 2014.However, in 2018, the audience was 15 percent smaller for the semi-finals, 17 percent for the third place play-off, and 5.1 percent for the final, which was watched by 517 million people on average (only in-home TV viewers), compared to 545 million in 2014.Presumably, the reason for that is the smaller countries involved in the top four games compared to those in 2014, and only one global region (Europe) being represented in 2018 (compared to South America and Europe in 2014).However the live global 1-minute reach of the final was 1.12 billion people (884.37 in-home TV viewers and 231.82 million out-of-home and (or) digital-only viewers).\n\nFIFA World Cup FIFA World Cup hosts 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup 2019 FIFA Women\'s World Cup\n', 'Claim_Context': ""Croatian player Luka Modrić

12,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018 FIFA World Cup', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The 2018 FIFA World Cup was the 21st FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for national football teams organized by FIFA.It took place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in late 2010.It was the eleventh time the championships had been held in Europe, the first time they were held in Eastern Europe, and the first time they were held across two continents (Europe and Asia).At an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion, it was the most expensive World Cup ever held until it was surpassed by the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nThe tournament phase involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through qualifying competitions, while the host nation Russia qualified automatically.Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the 2014 event, while Iceland and Panama each made their debut at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities.Germany, the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage for the first time since 1938.Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals.In the final, France played Croatia on 15 July at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.France won the match 4–2, claiming their second World Cup and becoming the fourth consecutive title won by a European team, after Italy in 2006, Spain in 2010, and Germany in 2014.\n\nCroatian player Luka Modrić was voted the tournament\'s best player, winning the Golden Ball.England\'s Harry Kane won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals during the tournament with six.Belgium\'s Thibaut Courtois won the Golden Glove, awarded to the goalkeeper with the best performance.It has been estimated that more than 3 million people attended games during the tournament.\n\nThe bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest.Initially, nine countries placed bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico later withdrew from the proceedings, and Indonesia\'s bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian government failed to submit a letter to support the bid.During the bidding process, the three remaining non-UEFA nations (Australia, Japan, and the United States) gradually withdrew from the 2018 bids, and thus all UEFA nations were ruled out of the 2022 bid.As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.\n\nThe 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting.The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third.England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.\n\nThe voting results were:\n\nThe choice of Russia as host was controversial.Issues included the high level of racism in Russian football, human rights abuses by Russian authorities, and discrimination against LGBT people in government (including gay propaganda laws) along with wider Russian society.Russia\'s involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine had also prompted calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the annexation of Crimea.In 2014, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that ""the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work"".\n\nRussia was criticised for alleged abuse of migrant labourers in the construction of World Cup venues, with Human Rights Watch reporting cases where workers were left unpaid, made to work in dangerously cold conditions, or suffering reprisals for raising concerns.A few pundits claimed it was slave labour.In May 2017, FIFA president Gianni Infantino admitted there had been human rights abuses of North Korean workers involved in the construction of Saint Petersburg\'s Zenit Arena.By June 2017, at least 17 workers had died on World Cup construction sites, according to Building and Wood Workers\' International.In August, a group of eight US senators called on FIFA to consider dismissing Russia as the World Cup host if an independent investigation verified allegations of North Koreans being subjected to forced labor.\n\nRacism and Neo-nazi symbols displayed in the past by some Russian football fans drew criticism, with documented incidents of racial chants, banners spewing hate-filled messages, and sometimes assaults on people from the Caucasus and Central Asia.In March 2015, FIFA\'s then Vice President Jeffrey Webb said that Russia posed a huge challenge from a racism standpoint, and that a World Cup could not be held there under the current conditions.On July, United Nations anti-discrimination official Yuri Boychenko said that Russian soccer authorities had failed to fully grasp what racism was and needed to do more to combat it.To address this as well as concerns of hooliganism in general, Russian intelligence services blacklisted over 400 fans from entering the stadiums by June 2018, with 32 other countries also sending officers to help local police screen attendees for valid ID cards.\n\nAllegations of corruption in the bidding processes and concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups led to threats from England\'s FA to boycott the tournament.They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and Sepp Blatter had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.FIFA appointed Michael J. Garcia, a US attorney, to investigate and produce a report on the corruption allegations.Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert.Eckert\'s summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert\'s absolving Russia from blame.Greg Dyke called for a re-examination of the affair and David Bernstein called for a boycott of the World Cup.Garcia criticised the summary as being ""materially incomplete"" with ""erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions"", and appealed to FIFA\'s Appeal Committee.The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned to protest of FIFA\'s conduct, citing a ""lack of leadership"" and lack of confidence in Eckert\'s independence.\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the FBI confirmed that federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.In an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA\'s Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that ""should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled"".Prince William of Wales and former British Prime Minister David Cameron attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in England was discussed.\n\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations—the 209 FIFA member associations except automatically qualified hosts Russia—applied to enter the qualifying process.Zimbabwe and Indonesia were later disqualified before playing their first matches, while Gibraltar and Kosovo, who joined FIFA on 13 May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.The first qualification game, between Timor-Leste and Mongolia, began in Dili on 12 March 2015 as part of the AFC\'s qualification, and the main qualifying draw took place at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, on 25 July 2015.\n\nOf the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2014.Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the smallest country in terms of population to reach the World Cup.Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments included: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, who last appeared in 1982; Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002.Poland, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Sweden have also returned after 12 years.It was the first time three Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four Arab nations (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.\n\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions Italy (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden and were the highest-ranked team to not qualify; and the Netherlands, who were three-time runners-up and had finished in third place in 2014, had qualified for the last three World Cups, and failed to qualify for their second major tournament in a row, missing out on the UEFA Euro 2016 as well.Four reigning continental champions: 2017 Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon; two-time Copa América champions and 2017 Confederations Cup runners-up Chile; 2016 OFC Nations Cup winners New Zealand; and 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup champions the United States (for the first time since 1986) also failed to qualify.The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Ghana and Ivory Coast, both of which had qualified for the three previous tournaments.The lowest-ranked team to qualify was the host nation, Russia.\n\nNote: Numbers in parentheses indicate positions in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the tournament.\n\nAFC (5) (36) (37) (61) (67) (57)\n\nCAF (5) (45) (41) (48) (27) (21)\n\nCONCACAF (3) (23) (15) (55)\n\nCONMEBOL (5) (5) (2) (16) (11) (14)\n\nOFC (0) None qualified\n\nUEFA (14) (3) (20) (joint 12) (joint 12) (7) (1) (22) (8) (4) (70) (hosts) (34) (10) (24) (6)\n\nThe draw was held on 1 December 2017 at 18:00 MSK at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow.The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, by selecting one team from each of the four ranked pots.\n\nFor the draw, the teams were allocated to four pots based entirely on the FIFA World Rankings of October 2017.Pot one contained the hosts Russia (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams.Pot two contained the next best eight teams, and so on for pots three and four.This was different from previous draws, when only pot one was based on FIFA rankings while the remaining pots were based on geographical considerations.However, teams from the same confederation still were not drawn against each other for the group stage, except that two UEFA teams could be in each group.The pots for the draw are shown below.\n\nInitially, each team had to name a preliminary squad of 30 players, but in February 2018 this was increased to 35.From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 23 players (three of whom had to be goalkeepers) by 4 June.Players in the final squad could be replaced for serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team\'s first match.These replacements did not need to have been named in the preliminary squad.\n\nFor players named in the 35-player preliminary squad, there was a mandatory rest period between 21 and 27 May 2018, except for those involved in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final played on 26 May.\n\nOn 29 March 2018, FIFA released the list of 36 referees and 63 assistant referees selected to oversee matches.On 30 April 2018, FIFA released the list of 13 video assistant referees, who acted solely in this capacity in the tournament.\n\nReferee Fahad Al-Mirdasi of Saudi Arabia was removed on 30 May 2018 over a match-fixing attempt, along with his two assistant referees, compatriots Mohammed Al-Abakry and Abdulah Al-Shalwai.A new referee was not appointed, but two assistant referees, Hasan Al Mahri of the United Arab Emirates and Hiroshi Yamauchi of Japan, were added to the list.Assistant referee Marwa Range of Kenya also withdrew after the BBC released an investigation conducted by a Ghanaian journalist which implicated him in a bribery scandal.\n\nShortly after the International Football Association Board\'s decision to incorporate video assistant referees (VARs) into the Laws of the game (LOTG) on 16 March 2018, the FIFA Council took the much-anticipated step of approving the use of VAR for the first time in a FIFA World Cup tournament.\n\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees.Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums\' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.\n\nVAR had a significant impact on several games.On 15 June 2018, Diego Costa\'s first goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision; the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16 June and resulted in a goal by Antoine Griezmann.A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, a phenomenon partially attributed to VAR.Overall, the new technology was both praised and criticised by commentators.FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.\n\nRussia proposed the following host cities: Kaliningrad, Kazan, Krasnodar, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg, Samara, Saransk, Sochi, Volgograd, Yaroslavl, and Yekaterinburg.Each chosen city was located in European Russia (except Yekaterinburg, which is located in Asia but lies very close to the Europe-Asia border) in order to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country.The bid evaluation report stated: ""The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA\'s minimum requirement.Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.""\n\nIn October 2011, Russia reduced the number of stadiums from 16 to 14.Construction of the proposed Podolsk stadium in the Moscow Oblast was cancelled by the regional government.Also, in the capital, Otkritie Arena was competing with Dynamo Stadium over which would be constructed first.\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29 September 2012.The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list.Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8 billion was spent on hosting the tournament.\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.He also said, ""We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums in South Africa, where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums"".\n\nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA\'s inspection committee and its head, Chris Unger, visited St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues.They were satisfied with the progress.On 8 October 2015, FIFA and the local organising committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums to be used during the tournament.Of the twelve venues, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium—the two largest stadiums in Russia—were used most; both hosted seven matches.Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara each hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Otkritie Stadium in Moscow and the Rostov Stadium hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each.Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk each hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\n\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Between 2010 (when Russia were announced as hosts) and 2018, nine of the twelve stadiums were built (some in place of older, outdated venues) and the other three were renovated for the tournament.Kaliningrad: Kaliningrad Stadium (new).The first piles were driven into the ground in September 2015.On 11 April 2018 it hosted its first match.Kazan: Kazan Arena (new).The stadium was built for the 2013 Summer Universiade.It has since hosted the 2015 World Aquatics Championships and the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup.It serves as a home arena for FC Rubin Kazan.Moscow: Luzhniki Stadium (heavily renovated).The largest stadium in the country, it was closed for renovation in 2013.It was commissioned in November 2017.Moscow: Spartak Stadium (new).This stadium is the home arena to its namesake FC Spartak Moscow.In accordance with FIFA requirements, during the 2018 World Cup, it was called Spartak Stadium instead of its usual name Otkritie Arena.It hosted its first match on 5 September 2014.Nizhny Novgorod: Nizhny Novgorod Stadium (new).Construction of this stadium commenced in 2015 and was completed in December 2017.Rostov-on-Don: Rostov Arena (new).The stadium is located on the left bank of the Don.Construction was completed on 22 December 2017.Saint Petersburg: Saint Petersburg Stadium (new).Construction commenced in 2007 after the site, formerly occupied by Kirov Stadium, was cleared.The project was officially completed on 29 December 2016.It has hosted 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup games and served as a venue for UEFA Euro 2020.Samara: Samara Arena (new).Construction officially started on 21 July 2014 and was completed on 21 April 2018.Saransk: Mordovia Arena (new).The stadium in Saransk was scheduled to be commissioned in 2012 in time for the opening of the all-Russian Spartakiad, but the plan was revised.The opening was rescheduled to 2017.The arena hosted its first match on 21 April 2018.Sochi: Fisht Stadium (slightly renovated).This stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics.Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup.Volgograd: Volgograd Arena (new).The main Volgograd arena was built on the demolished Central Stadium site, at the foot of the Mamayev Kurgan memorial complex.It was commissioned on 3 April 2018.Yekaterinburg: Ekaterinburg Arena (heavily renovated).The Central Stadium of Yekaterinburg had been renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Its stands have a capacity of 35,000 spectators.The renovation project was completed in December 2017.\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament.On 9 February 2018, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team.\n\nArgentina: Bronnitsy, Moscow Oblast Australia: Kazan, Tatarstan Belgium: Krasnogorsky, Moscow Oblast Brazil: Sochi, Krasnodar Krai Colombia: Verkhneuslonsky, Tatarstan Costa Rica: Saint Petersburg Croatia: Roshchino, Leningrad Oblast Denmark: Anapa,

over $14.2 billion , the 2018 FIFA event was the most expensive World Cup in history, surpassing the $11.6 billion cost of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.\n\nThe Russian government had originally earmarked a budget of around $20 billion, which was later slashed to $10 billion, for World Cup preparations.Half was spent on transportation infrastructure.As part of the program to prepare for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a federal sub-program—""Construction and Renovation of Transport Infrastructure""—was implemented with a total budget of ₽352.5 billion (rubles), with ₽170.3 billion coming from the federal budget, ₽35.1 billion from regional budgets, and ₽147.1 billion from investors.The biggest item of federal spending was the aviation infrastructure costing ₽117.8 billion.Construction of new hotels was a crucial area of infrastructure development in World Cup host cities.Costs continued to mount as preparations were underway.\n\nPlatov International Airport in Rostov-on-Don was upgraded with automated air traffic control systems.Modern surveillance, navigation, communication, control, and meteorological support systems were also installed.Koltsovo Airport in Yekaterinburg was upgraded with radio-engineering tools for flight operation and received a second runway.Saransk Airport received a new navigation system; two new hotels were constructed in the city—the Mercure Saransk Centre (Accor Hotels) and Four Points by Sheraton Saransk as well as few other smaller accommodation facilities.In Samara, new tram lines were laid.Khrabrovo Airport in Kaliningrad was upgraded with radio navigation and weather equipment.Renovation and upgraded radio-engineering tools for flight operations was completed in the Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Volgograd, Samara, Yekaterinburg, Kazan and Sochi airports.On 27 March, the Russian Ministry of Construction Industry, Housing and Utilities Sector of reported that all communications within its area of responsibility had been commissioned.The last facility commissioned was a waste treatment station in Volgograd.In Yekaterinburg, where four matches were hosted, hosting costs increased to over ₽7.4 billion, exceeding the ₽5.6 billion rubles originally allocated from the state and regional budget.\n\nVolunteer applications to the 2018 Russia Local Organising Committee opened on 1 June 2016.The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Volunteer Program received about 177,000 applications, and engaged a total of 35,000 volunteers.They received training at 15 Volunteer Centres of the local organising committee based in 15 universities, and in volunteer centres in the host cities.Preference, especially in key areas, was given to those with knowledge of a foreign language and volunteering experience, but not necessarily to Russian nationals.\n\nFree public transport services were offered for ticketholders during the World Cup, including additional trains linking host cities, as well as services such as bus services within them.\n\nThe full schedule was announced by FIFA on 24 July 2015 without kick-off times, which were confirmed later.On 1 December 2017, following the final draw, FIFA adjusted six kick-off times.\n\nRussia was placed in position A1 in the group stage and played in the opening match at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on 14 June against Saudi Arabia, the two lowest-ranked teams of the tournament at the time of the final draw.The Luzhniki Stadium also hosted the second semi-final on 11 July and the final on 15 July.The Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg hosted the first semi-final on 10 July and the third place play-off on 14 July.\n\nThe opening ceremony took place on Thursday, 14 June 2018, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, preceding the opening match of the tournament between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia.\n\nAt the start of the ceremony, Russian president Vladimir Putin gave a speech, welcoming the countries of the world to Russia and calling football a uniting force.Brazilian World Cup-winning striker Ronaldo entered the stadium with a child in a Russia jersey.Pop singer Robbie Williams then sang two of his songs solo before he and Russian soprano Aida Garifullina performed a duet.Dancers dressed in the flags of the 32 competing teams appeared carrying a sign with the name of each nation.At the end of the ceremony Ronaldo reappeared with the official match ball which had returned from the International Space Station in early June.\n\nYoung participants of the international children\'s social programme Football for Friendship from 211 countries and regions took part in the opening ceremony of the FIFA World Cup at the Luzhniki stadium.\n\nCompeting countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H).Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage.Ten European teams and four South American teams progressed to the knockout stage, together with Japan and Mexico.\n\nFor the first time since 1938, Germany, the reigning champions, were eliminated in the first round.This was the third consecutive tournament in which the holders were eliminated in the first round, after Italy in 2010 and Spain in 2014.No African team progressed to the second round for the first time since 1982.The fair play criteria came into use for the first time when Japan qualified over Senegal because the team had received fewer yellow cards.Only one match, France versus Denmark, was goalless.Until then there were a record 36 straight games in which at least one goal was scored.All times listed below are local time.\n\nIn the knockout stages, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winners.If a match went into extra time, each team was allowed to make a fourth substitution, the first time this had been allowed in a FIFA World Cup tournament.Below is the bracket for the knockout round of the tournament, teams in bold denote match winners.\n\nIn total, only four players were sent off in the entire tournament, the fewest since 1978.International Football Association Board technical director David Elleray stated a belief that this was due to the introduction of VAR, since players would know that they would not be able to get away with anything under the new system.\n\nA player is automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences: Receiving a red card (red card suspensions may be extended for serious offences)Receiving two yellow cards in two matches; yellow cards expire after the completion of the quarter-finals (yellow card suspensions are not carried forward to any other future international matches)\n\nThe following suspensions were served during the tournament:\n\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament.The Golden Boot (top scorer), Golden Ball (best overall player) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper) awards were all sponsored by Adidas.\n\nThe users of FIFA.com elected their Fan Dream Team.\n\nAdditionally, FIFA.com shortlisted 18 goals for users to vote on as the tournament\'s best.The poll closed on 23 July.The award was sponsored by Hyundai.\n\nFIFA published an All-Star Team, this year called the Fantasy Team, based on player performances evaluated through statistical data.\n\nPrize money amounts were announced in October 2017.\n\nThe tournament logo was unveiled on 28 October 2014 by cosmonauts at the International Space Station and then projected onto Moscow\'s Bolshoi Theatre during an evening television programme.Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said the logo was inspired by ""Russia\'s rich artistic tradition and its history of bold achievement and innovation"", and FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that it reflected the ""heart and soul"" of the country.For branding, Portuguese design agency Brandia Central created materials in 2014, with a typeface called Dusha – – designed by Brandia Central and edited by Adotbelow of the DSType Foundry in Portugal.\n\nThe first phase of ticket sales started on 14 September 2017, 12:00 Moscow Time, and lasted until 12 October 2017.\n\nThe general visa policy of Russia did not apply to participants and spectators, who were able to visit Russia without a visa right before and during the competition regardless of their citizenship.Spectators were nonetheless required to register for a ""Fan-ID"", a special photo identification pass.A Fan-ID was required to enter the country visa-free, while a ticket, Fan-ID and a valid passport were required to enter stadiums for matches.Fan-IDs also granted World Cup attendees free access to public transport services, including buses, and train service between host cities.Fan-ID was administered by the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, which could revoke this accreditation at any time to ""ensure the defence capability or security of the state or public order"".\n\nOn 29 May 2018, Electronic Arts released a free update to their video game FIFA 18 that added content related to the 2018 FIFA World Cup.The expansion included a World Cup tournament mode with all teams and stadiums from the event, official television presentation elements, and World Cup-related content for the Ultimate Team mode.\n\nPanini continued their partnership with FIFA by producing stickers for their World Cup sticker album.Panini also developed an app for the 2018 World Cup where fans could collect and swap virtual stickers, with 5 million fans gathering digital stickers for the tournament.\n\nThe tournament\'s official mascot was unveiled on 21 October 2016, and selected through a design competition among university students.A public vote was used to select the mascot from three finalists—a cat, a tiger, and a wolf.The winner, with 53% or approximately 1 million votes, was Zabivaka—an anthropomorphic wolf dressed in the colours of the Russian national team.Zabivaka\'s name is a portmanteau of the Russian words забияка (""hothead"") and забивать (""to score""), and his official backstory states that he is an aspiring football player who is ""charming, confident and social"".\n\nThe official match ball, the ""Telstar 18"", was unveiled on 9 November 2017.It was based on the name and design of the first Adidas World Cup ball from 1970.A special red-coloured variation, ""Telstar Mechta"", was used for the knockout stage of the tournament.The word mechta (Russian: мечта) means ""dream"" or ""ambition"".\n\nGoalkeepers noted that the ball was slippery and prone to having unpredictable trajectory.In addition, two Telstar 18 balls popped in the midst of a first-round match between France and Australia, leading to further discussions over the ball\'s performance.\n\nThe official song of the tournament was ""Live It Up"", with vocals by Will Smith, Nicky Jam and Era Istrefi, released on 25 May 2018.Its music video was released on 8 June 2018.\n\nThirty-three footballers who were alleged to be part of the Russian steroid programme are listed in the McLaren Report.On 22 December 2017, it was reported that FIFA had fired a doctor who had been investigating doping in Russian football.On 22 May 2018, FIFA stated that the investigations concerning all Russian players named for the provisional squad of the FIFA World Cup in Russia had been completed, with the result that insufficient evidence was found to support anti-doping rule violations.FIFA\'s medical committee also decided that Russian personnel would not be involved in performing drug testing procedures at the tournament, an action taken to reassure teams that samples would not be tampered with.\n\nRussia relaxed its visa rules during the World Cup, allowing Fan ID holders to enter and exit Russia without a visa through 31 December 2018.Traffickers exploited this system to bring foreign sex trafficking victims into the country, especially from Nigeria.Reuters had raised concerns about the victims\' conditions, who had allegedly been forced into prostitution, with some of them enduring violent abuse.Russian authorities were accused of doing little to fix to the issue, allegedly because many locals blamed the victims for falling into prostitution.\n\nIn response to the March 2018 poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, British prime minister Theresa May announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans.Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that the West are trying to ""take the World Cup out of Russia"".The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced Boris Johnson\'s statements that compared the event to the 1936 Olympics held in Nazi Germany as ""poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness"" and ""unacceptable and unworthy"" parallel towards Russia, a ""nation that lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism"".\n\nAt the close of the World Cup, Russia was widely praised for its success in hosting the tournament, with Steve Rosenberg of the BBC deeming it ""a resounding public relations success"" for Putin, adding: ""The stunning new stadiums, free train travel to venues and the absence of crowd violence has impressed visiting supporters.Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country\'s authoritarian image.All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised.""\n\nDespite the British Foreign Office and MPs repeatedly warning English football fans travelling to Russia of ""racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility"", fans who did travel said they received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino stated: ""Everyone discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, that is keen to show the world that everything that has been said before might not be true.A lot of preconceived ideas have been changed because people have seen the true nature of Russia.""Infantino has proclaimed Russia 2018 to be ""the best World Cup ever.""98 percent of the stadiums were sold out, there were 3 billion viewers on TV around the world and 7 million fans visited the fan fests.It was the most viewed World Cup to date, and the third most viewed television broadcast, surpassing the Beijing Olympics in 2008.\n\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters.After having tested the technology at limited matches of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the 2014 FIFA World Cup (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of Rio de Janeiro), the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in 4K ultra high definition.Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut of each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being converted up from 1080p high definition sources with limited degradation in quality.These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder UA:PBC stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup due to existing tensions with Russia amidst the Russo-Ukrainian War.This came in the wake of growing boycott of the tournament by the Football Federation of Ukraine and sports minister Ihor Zhdanov.Additionally, the FFU refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing diplomatic crisis in Qatar, which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar—the home country of FIFA\'s Middle East and Africa rightsholder beIN Sports—in June 2017, over its alleged state support of terrorist groups.On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from Du and Etisalat, but with service to the latter restored later that day.Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as ""beoutQ"".While FIFA attempted to negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final indirectly, they were unable to do so.On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had ""engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.""\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men\'s World Cup whose English rights were held by Fox Sports, and Spanish rights held by Telemundo.The elimination of the United States in the qualifiers led to concerns that U.S. interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that ""casual"" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5 million in 2014, and determined how much Fox paid for the rights.During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among Hispanic and Latino Americans.Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of tournament coverage.Viewership was down overall compared to 2014; match scheduling and time zones were not as favourable to viewers in the Americas as they were in 2014.Many games aired in the morning hours, although Telemundo\'s broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday daytime program in the network\'s history.\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, Korean Central Television acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea.Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time.In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to strained relations and campaigns against the country.\n\nA combined 3.572 billion unique viewers (live global 1-minute reach) – more than half of the global population aged four and over – tuned in to world football\'s ultimate competition, according to audience data for official broadcast coverage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe average global live audience for every game of the tournament was 191 million viewers (for a cumulative live audience of 12.224 billion viewers), a 2.1% increase over the 2014 tournament average of 187 million viewers, including that average audience in the early stages (group stage and round of 16) were bigger than in 2014.However, in 2018, the audience was 15 percent smaller for the semi-finals, 17 percent for the third place play-off, and 5.1 percent for the final, which was watched by 517 million people on average (only in-home TV viewers), compared to 545 million in 2014.Presumably, the reason for that is the smaller countries involved in the top four games compared to those in 2014, and only one global region (Europe) being represented in 2018 (compared to South America and Europe in 2014).However the live global 1-minute reach of the final was 1.12 billion people (884.37 in-home TV viewers and 231.82 million out-of-home and (or) digital-only viewers).\n\nFIFA World Cup FIFA World Cup hosts 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup 2019 FIFA Women\'s World Cup\n', 'Claim_Context': ""Croatian player Luka Modrić

13,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018 FIFA World Cup', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The 2018 FIFA World Cup was the 21st FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for national football teams organized by FIFA.It took place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in late 2010.It was the eleventh time the championships had been held in Europe, the first time they were held in Eastern Europe, and the first time they were held across two continents (Europe and Asia).At an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion, it was the most expensive World Cup ever held until it was surpassed by the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nThe tournament phase involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through qualifying competitions, while the host nation Russia qualified automatically.Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the 2014 event, while Iceland and Panama each made their debut at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities.Germany, the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage for the first time since 1938.Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals.In the final, France played Croatia on 15 July at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.France won the match 4–2, claiming their second World Cup and becoming the fourth consecutive title won by a European team, after Italy in 2006, Spain in 2010, and Germany in 2014.\n\nCroatian player Luka Modrić was voted the tournament\'s best player, winning the Golden Ball.England\'s Harry Kane won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals during the tournament with six.Belgium\'s Thibaut Courtois won the Golden Glove, awarded to the goalkeeper with the best performance.It has been estimated that more than 3 million people attended games during the tournament.\n\nThe bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest.Initially, nine countries placed bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico later withdrew from the proceedings, and Indonesia\'s bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian government failed to submit a letter to support the bid.During the bidding process, the three remaining non-UEFA nations (Australia, Japan, and the United States) gradually withdrew from the 2018 bids, and thus all UEFA nations were ruled out of the 2022 bid.As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.\n\nThe 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting.The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third.England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.\n\nThe voting results were:\n\nThe choice of Russia as host was controversial.Issues included the high level of racism in Russian football, human rights abuses by Russian authorities, and discrimination against LGBT people in government (including gay propaganda laws) along with wider Russian society.Russia\'s involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine had also prompted calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the annexation of Crimea.In 2014, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that ""the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work"".\n\nRussia was criticised for alleged abuse of migrant labourers in the construction of World Cup venues, with Human Rights Watch reporting cases where workers were left unpaid, made to work in dangerously cold conditions, or suffering reprisals for raising concerns.A few pundits claimed it was slave labour.In May 2017, FIFA president Gianni Infantino admitted there had been human rights abuses of North Korean workers involved in the construction of Saint Petersburg\'s Zenit Arena.By June 2017, at least 17 workers had died on World Cup construction sites, according to Building and Wood Workers\' International.In August, a group of eight US senators called on FIFA to consider dismissing Russia as the World Cup host if an independent investigation verified allegations of North Koreans being subjected to forced labor.\n\nRacism and Neo-nazi symbols displayed in the past by some Russian football fans drew criticism, with documented incidents of racial chants, banners spewing hate-filled messages, and sometimes assaults on people from the Caucasus and Central Asia.In March 2015, FIFA\'s then Vice President Jeffrey Webb said that Russia posed a huge challenge from a racism standpoint, and that a World Cup could not be held there under the current conditions.On July, United Nations anti-discrimination official Yuri Boychenko said that Russian soccer authorities had failed to fully grasp what racism was and needed to do more to combat it.To address this as well as concerns of hooliganism in general, Russian intelligence services blacklisted over 400 fans from entering the stadiums by June 2018, with 32 other countries also sending officers to help local police screen attendees for valid ID cards.\n\nAllegations of corruption in the bidding processes and concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups led to threats from England\'s FA to boycott the tournament.They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and Sepp Blatter had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.FIFA appointed Michael J. Garcia, a US attorney, to investigate and produce a report on the corruption allegations.Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert.Eckert\'s summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert\'s absolving Russia from blame.Greg Dyke called for a re-examination of the affair and David Bernstein called for a boycott of the World Cup.Garcia criticised the summary as being ""materially incomplete"" with ""erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions"", and appealed to FIFA\'s Appeal Committee.The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned to protest of FIFA\'s conduct, citing a ""lack of leadership"" and lack of confidence in Eckert\'s independence.\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the FBI confirmed that federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.In an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA\'s Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that ""should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled"".Prince William of Wales and former British Prime Minister David Cameron attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in England was discussed.\n\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations—the 209 FIFA member associations except automatically qualified hosts Russia—applied to enter the qualifying process.Zimbabwe and Indonesia were later disqualified before playing their first matches, while Gibraltar and Kosovo, who joined FIFA on 13 May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.The first qualification game, between Timor-Leste and Mongolia, began in Dili on 12 March 2015 as part of the AFC\'s qualification, and the main qualifying draw took place at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, on 25 July 2015.\n\nOf the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2014.Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the smallest country in terms of population to reach the World Cup.Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments included: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, who last appeared in 1982; Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002.Poland, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Sweden have also returned after 12 years.It was the first time three Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four Arab nations (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.\n\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions Italy (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden and were the highest-ranked team to not qualify; and the Netherlands, who were three-time runners-up and had finished in third place in 2014, had qualified for the last three World Cups, and failed to qualify for their second major tournament in a row, missing out on the UEFA Euro 2016 as well.Four reigning continental champions: 2017 Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon; two-time Copa América champions and 2017 Confederations Cup runners-up Chile; 2016 OFC Nations Cup winners New Zealand; and 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup champions the United States (for the first time since 1986) also failed to qualify.The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Ghana and Ivory Coast, both of which had qualified for the three previous tournaments.The lowest-ranked team to qualify was the host nation, Russia.\n\nNote: Numbers in parentheses indicate positions in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the tournament.\n\nAFC (5) (36) (37) (61) (67) (57)\n\nCAF (5) (45) (41) (48) (27) (21)\n\nCONCACAF (3) (23) (15)

December 2017 at 18:00 MSK at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow.The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, by selecting one team from each of the four ranked pots.\n\nFor the draw, the teams were allocated to four pots based entirely on the FIFA World Rankings of October 2017.Pot one contained the hosts Russia (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams.Pot two contained the next best eight teams, and so on for pots three and four.This was different from previous draws, when only pot one was based on FIFA rankings while the remaining pots were based on geographical considerations.However, teams from the same confederation still were not drawn against each other for the group stage, except that two UEFA teams could be in each group.The pots for the draw are shown below.\n\nInitially, each team had to name a preliminary squad of 30 players, but in February 2018 this was increased to 35.From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 23 players (three of whom had to be goalkeepers) by 4 June.Players in the final squad could be replaced for serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team\'s first match.These replacements did not need to have been named in the preliminary squad.\n\nFor players named in the 35-player preliminary squad, there was a mandatory rest period between 21 and 27 May 2018, except for those involved in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final played on 26 May.\n\nOn 29 March 2018, FIFA released the list of 36 referees and 63 assistant referees selected to oversee matches.On 30 April 2018, FIFA released the list of 13 video assistant referees, who acted solely in this capacity in the tournament.\n\nReferee Fahad Al-Mirdasi of Saudi Arabia was removed on 30 May 2018 over a match-fixing attempt, along with his two assistant referees, compatriots Mohammed Al-Abakry and Abdulah Al-Shalwai.A new referee was not appointed, but two assistant referees, Hasan Al Mahri of the United Arab Emirates and Hiroshi Yamauchi of Japan, were added to the list.Assistant referee Marwa Range of Kenya also withdrew after the BBC released an investigation conducted by a Ghanaian journalist which implicated him in a bribery scandal.\n\nShortly after the International Football Association Board\'s decision to incorporate video assistant referees (VARs) into the Laws of the game (LOTG) on 16 March 2018, the FIFA Council took the much-anticipated step of approving the use of VAR for the first time in a FIFA World Cup tournament.\n\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees.Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums\' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.\n\nVAR had a significant impact on several games.On 15 June 2018, Diego Costa\'s first goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision; the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16 June and resulted in a goal by Antoine Griezmann.A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, a phenomenon partially attributed to VAR.Overall, the new technology was both praised and criticised by commentators.FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.\n\nRussia proposed the following host cities: Kaliningrad, Kazan, Krasnodar, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg, Samara, Saransk, Sochi, Volgograd, Yaroslavl, and Yekaterinburg.Each chosen city was located in European Russia (except Yekaterinburg, which is located in Asia but lies very close to the Europe-Asia border) in order to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country.The bid evaluation report stated: ""The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA\'s minimum requirement.Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.""\n\nIn October 2011, Russia reduced the number of stadiums from 16 to 14.Construction of the proposed Podolsk stadium in the Moscow Oblast was cancelled by the regional government.Also, in the capital, Otkritie Arena was competing with Dynamo Stadium over which would be constructed first.\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29 September 2012.The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list.Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8 billion was spent on hosting the tournament.\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.He also said, ""We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums in South Africa, where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums"".\n\nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA\'s inspection committee and its head, Chris Unger, visited St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues.They were satisfied with the progress.On 8 October 2015, FIFA and the local organising committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums to be used during the tournament.Of the twelve venues, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium—the two largest stadiums in Russia—were used most; both hosted seven matches.Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara each hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Otkritie Stadium in Moscow and the Rostov Stadium hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each.Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk each hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\n\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Between 2010 (when Russia were announced as hosts) and 2018, nine of the twelve stadiums were built (some in place of older, outdated venues) and the other three were renovated for the tournament.Kaliningrad: Kaliningrad Stadium (new).The first piles were driven into the ground in September 2015.On 11 April 2018 it hosted its first match.Kazan: Kazan Arena (new).The stadium was built for the 2013 Summer Universiade.It has since hosted the 2015 World Aquatics Championships and the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup.It serves as a home arena for FC Rubin Kazan.Moscow: Luzhniki Stadium (heavily renovated).The largest stadium in the country, it was closed for renovation in 2013.It was commissioned in November 2017.Moscow: Spartak Stadium (new).This stadium is the home arena to its namesake FC Spartak Moscow.In accordance with FIFA requirements, during the 2018 World Cup, it was called Spartak Stadium instead of its usual name Otkritie Arena.It hosted its first match on 5 September 2014.Nizhny Novgorod: Nizhny Novgorod Stadium (new).Construction of this stadium commenced in 2015 and was completed in December 2017.Rostov-on-Don: Rostov Arena (new).The stadium is located on the left bank of the Don.Construction was completed on 22 December 2017.Saint Petersburg: Saint Petersburg Stadium (new).Construction commenced in 2007 after the site, formerly occupied by Kirov Stadium, was cleared.The project was officially completed on 29 December 2016.It has hosted 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup games and served as a venue for UEFA Euro 2020.Samara: Samara Arena (new).Construction officially started on 21 July 2014 and was completed on 21 April 2018.Saransk: Mordovia Arena (new).The stadium in Saransk was scheduled to be commissioned in 2012 in time for the opening of the all-Russian Spartakiad, but the plan was revised.The opening was rescheduled to 2017.The arena hosted its first match on 21 April 2018.Sochi: Fisht Stadium (slightly renovated).This stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics.Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup.Volgograd: Volgograd Arena (new).The main Volgograd arena was built on the demolished Central Stadium site, at the foot of the Mamayev Kurgan memorial complex.It was commissioned on 3 April 2018.Yekaterinburg: Ekaterinburg Arena (heavily renovated).The Central Stadium of Yekaterinburg had been renovated for the FIFA World Cup.Its stands have a capacity of 35,000 spectators.The renovation project was completed in December 2017.\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament.On 9 February 2018, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team.\n\nArgentina: Bronnitsy, Moscow Oblast Australia: Kazan,

over $14.2 billion , the 2018 FIFA event was the most expensive World Cup in history, surpassing the $11.6 billion cost of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.\n\nThe Russian government had originally earmarked a budget of around $20 billion, which was later slashed to $10 billion, for World Cup preparations.Half was spent on transportation infrastructure.As part of the program to prepare for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a federal sub-program—""Construction and Renovation of Transport Infrastructure""—was implemented with a total budget of ₽352.5 billion (rubles), with ₽170.3 billion coming from the federal budget, ₽35.1 billion from regional budgets, and ₽147.1 billion from investors.The biggest item of federal spending was the aviation infrastructure costing ₽117.8 billion.Construction of new hotels was a crucial area of infrastructure development in World Cup host cities.Costs continued to mount as preparations were underway.\n\nPlatov International Airport in Rostov-on-Don was upgraded with automated air traffic control systems.Modern surveillance, navigation, communication, control, and meteorological support systems were also installed.Koltsovo Airport in Yekaterinburg was upgraded with radio-engineering tools for flight operation and received a second runway.Saransk Airport received a new navigation system; two new hotels were constructed in the city—the Mercure Saransk Centre (Accor Hotels) and Four Points by Sheraton Saransk as well as few other smaller accommodation facilities.In Samara, new tram lines were laid.Khrabrovo Airport in Kaliningrad was upgraded with radio navigation and weather equipment.Renovation and upgraded radio-engineering tools for flight operations was completed in the Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Volgograd, Samara, Yekaterinburg, Kazan and Sochi airports.On 27 March, the Russian Ministry of Construction Industry, Housing and Utilities Sector of reported that all communications within its area of responsibility had been commissioned.The last facility commissioned was a waste treatment station in Volgograd.In Yekaterinburg, where four matches were hosted, hosting costs increased to over ₽7.4 billion, exceeding the ₽5.6 billion rubles originally allocated from the state and regional budget.\n\nVolunteer applications to the 2018 Russia Local Organising Committee opened on 1 June 2016.The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Volunteer Program received about 177,000 applications, and engaged a total of 35,000 volunteers.They received training at 15 Volunteer Centres of the local organising committee based in 15 universities, and in volunteer centres in the host cities.Preference, especially in key areas, was given to those with knowledge of a foreign language and volunteering experience, but not necessarily to Russian nationals.\n\nFree public transport services were offered for ticketholders during the World Cup, including additional trains linking host cities, as well as services such as bus services within them.\n\nThe full schedule was announced by FIFA on 24 July 2015 without kick-off times, which were confirmed later.On 1 December 2017, following the final draw, FIFA adjusted six kick-off times.\n\nRussia was placed in position A1 in the group stage and played in the opening match at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on 14 June against Saudi Arabia, the two lowest-ranked teams of the tournament at the time of the final draw.The Luzhniki Stadium also hosted the second semi-final on 11 July and the final on 15 July.The Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg hosted the first semi-final on 10 July and the third place play-off on 14 July.\n\nThe opening ceremony took place on Thursday, 14 June 2018, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, preceding the opening match of the tournament between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia.\n\nAt the start of the ceremony, Russian president Vladimir Putin gave a speech, welcoming the countries of the world to Russia and calling football a uniting force.Brazilian World Cup-winning striker Ronaldo entered the stadium with a child in a Russia jersey.Pop singer Robbie Williams then sang two of his songs solo before he and Russian soprano Aida Garifullina performed a duet.Dancers dressed in the flags of the 32 competing teams appeared carrying a sign with the name of each nation.At the end of the ceremony Ronaldo reappeared with the official match ball which had returned from the International Space Station in early June.\n\nYoung participants of the international children\'s social programme Football for Friendship from 211 countries and regions took part in the opening ceremony of the FIFA World Cup at the Luzhniki stadium.\n\nCompeting countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H).Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage.Ten European teams and four South American teams progressed to the knockout stage, together with Japan and Mexico.\n\nFor the first time since 1938, Germany, the reigning champions, were eliminated in the first round.This was the third consecutive tournament in which the holders were eliminated in the first round, after Italy in 2010 and Spain in 2014.No African team progressed to the second round for the first time since 1982.The fair play criteria came into use for the first time when Japan qualified over Senegal because the team had received fewer yellow cards.Only one match, France versus Denmark, was goalless.Until then there were a record 36 straight games in which at least one goal was scored.All times listed below are local time.\n\nIn the knockout stages, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winners.If a match went into extra time, each team was allowed to make a fourth substitution, the first time this had been allowed in a FIFA World Cup tournament.Below is the bracket for the knockout round of the tournament, teams in bold denote match winners.\n\nIn total, only four players were sent off in the entire tournament, the fewest since 1978.International Football Association Board technical director David Elleray stated a belief that this was due to the introduction of VAR, since players would know that they would not be able to get away with anything under the new system.\n\nA player is automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences: Receiving a red card (red card suspensions may be extended for serious offences)Receiving two yellow cards in two matches; yellow cards expire after the completion of the quarter-finals (yellow card suspensions are not carried forward to any other future international matches)\n\nThe following suspensions were served during the tournament:\n\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament.The Golden Boot (top scorer), Golden Ball (best overall player) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper) awards were all sponsored by Adidas.\n\nThe users of FIFA.com elected their Fan Dream Team.\n\nAdditionally, FIFA.com shortlisted 18 goals for users to vote on as the tournament\'s best.The poll closed on 23 July.The award was sponsored by Hyundai.\n\nFIFA published an All-Star Team, this year called the Fantasy Team, based on player performances evaluated through statistical data.\n\nPrize money amounts were announced in October 2017.\n\nThe tournament logo was unveiled on 28 October 2014 by cosmonauts at the International Space Station and then projected onto Moscow\'s Bolshoi Theatre during an evening television programme.Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said the logo was inspired by ""Russia\'s rich artistic tradition and its history of bold achievement and innovation"", and FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that it reflected the ""heart and soul"" of the country.For branding, Portuguese design agency Brandia Central created materials in 2014, with a typeface called Dusha – – designed by Brandia Central and edited by Adotbelow of the DSType Foundry in Portugal.\n\nThe first phase of ticket sales started on 14 September 2017, 12:00 Moscow Time, and lasted until 12 October 2017.\n\nThe general visa policy of Russia did not apply to participants and spectators, who were able to visit Russia without a visa right before and during the competition regardless of their citizenship.Spectators were nonetheless required to register for a ""Fan-ID"", a special photo identification pass.A Fan-ID was required to enter the country visa-free, while a ticket, Fan-ID and a valid passport were required to enter stadiums for matches.Fan-IDs also granted World Cup attendees free access to public transport services, including buses, and train service between host cities.Fan-ID was administered by the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, which could revoke this accreditation at any time to ""ensure the defence capability or security of the state or public order"".\n\nOn 29 May 2018, Electronic Arts released a free update to their video game FIFA 18 that added content related to the 2018 FIFA World Cup.The expansion included a World Cup tournament mode with all teams and stadiums from the event, official television presentation elements, and World Cup-related content for the Ultimate Team mode.\n\nPanini continued their partnership with FIFA by producing stickers for their World Cup sticker album.Panini also developed an app for the 2018 World Cup where fans could collect and swap virtual stickers, with 5 million fans gathering digital stickers for the tournament.\n\nThe tournament\'s official mascot was unveiled on 21 October 2016, and selected through a design competition among university students.A public vote was used to select the mascot from three finalists—a cat, a tiger, and a wolf.The winner, with 53% or approximately 1 million votes, was Zabivaka—an anthropomorphic wolf dressed in the colours of the Russian national team.Zabivaka\'s name is a portmanteau of the Russian words забияка (""hothead"") and забивать (""to score""), and his official backstory states that he is an aspiring football player who is ""charming, confident and social"".\n\nThe official match ball, the ""Telstar 18"", was unveiled on 9 November 2017.It was based on the name and design of the first Adidas World Cup ball from 1970.A special red-coloured variation, ""Telstar Mechta"", was used for the knockout stage of the tournament.The word mechta (Russian: мечта) means ""dream"" or ""ambition"".\n\nGoalkeepers noted that the ball was slippery and prone to having unpredictable trajectory.In addition, two Telstar 18 balls popped in the midst of a first-round match between France and Australia, leading to further discussions over the ball\'s performance.\n\nThe official song of the tournament was ""Live It Up"", with vocals by Will Smith, Nicky Jam and Era Istrefi, released on 25 May 2018.Its music video was released on 8 June 2018.\n\nThirty-three footballers who were alleged to be part of the Russian steroid programme are listed in the McLaren Report.On 22 December 2017, it was reported that FIFA had fired a doctor who had been investigating doping in Russian football.On 22 May 2018, FIFA stated that the investigations concerning all Russian players named for the provisional squad of the FIFA World Cup in Russia had been completed, with the result that insufficient evidence was found to support anti-doping rule violations.FIFA\'s medical committee also decided that Russian personnel would not be involved in performing drug testing procedures at the tournament, an action taken to reassure teams that samples would not be tampered with.\n\nRussia relaxed its visa rules during the World Cup, allowing Fan ID holders to enter and exit Russia without a visa through 31 December 2018.Traffickers exploited this system to bring foreign sex trafficking victims into the country, especially from Nigeria.Reuters had raised concerns about the victims\' conditions, who had allegedly been forced into prostitution, with some of them enduring violent abuse.Russian authorities were accused of doing little to fix to the issue, allegedly because many locals blamed the victims for falling into prostitution.\n\nIn response to the March 2018 poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, British prime minister Theresa May announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans.Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that the West are trying to ""take the World Cup out of Russia"".The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced Boris Johnson\'s statements that compared the event to the 1936 Olympics held in Nazi Germany as ""poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness"" and ""unacceptable and unworthy"" parallel towards Russia, a ""nation that lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism"".\n\nAt the close of the World Cup, Russia was widely praised for its success in hosting the tournament, with Steve Rosenberg of the BBC deeming it ""a resounding public relations success"" for Putin, adding: ""The stunning new stadiums, free train travel to venues and the absence of crowd violence has impressed visiting supporters.Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country\'s authoritarian image.All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised.""\n\nDespite the British Foreign Office and MPs repeatedly warning English football fans travelling to Russia of ""racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility"", fans who did travel said they received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino stated: ""Everyone discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, that is keen to show the world that everything that has been said before might not be true.A lot of preconceived ideas have been changed because people have seen the true nature of Russia.""Infantino has proclaimed Russia 2018 to be ""the best World Cup ever.""98 percent of the stadiums were sold out, there were 3 billion viewers on TV around the world and 7 million fans visited the fan fests.It was the most viewed World Cup to date, and the third most viewed television broadcast, surpassing the Beijing Olympics in 2008.\n\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters.After having tested the technology at limited matches of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the 2014 FIFA World Cup (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of Rio de Janeiro), the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in 4K ultra high definition.Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut of each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being converted up from 1080p high definition sources with limited degradation in quality.These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder UA:PBC stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup due to existing tensions with Russia amidst the Russo-Ukrainian War.This came in the wake of growing boycott of the tournament by the Football Federation of Ukraine and sports minister Ihor Zhdanov.Additionally, the FFU refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing diplomatic crisis in Qatar, which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar—the home country of FIFA\'s Middle East and Africa rightsholder beIN Sports—in June 2017, over its alleged state support of terrorist groups.On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from Du and Etisalat, but with service to the latter restored later that day.Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as ""beoutQ"".While FIFA attempted to negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final indirectly, they were unable to do so.On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had ""engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.""\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men\'s World Cup whose English rights were held by Fox Sports, and Spanish rights held by Telemundo.The elimination of the United States in the qualifiers led to concerns that U.S. interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that ""casual"" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5 million in 2014, and determined how much Fox paid for the rights.During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among Hispanic and Latino Americans.Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of tournament coverage.Viewership was down overall compared to 2014; match scheduling and time zones were not as favourable to viewers in the Americas as they were in 2014.Many games aired in the morning hours, although Telemundo\'s broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday daytime program in the network\'s history.\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, Korean Central Television acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea.Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time.In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to strained relations and campaigns against the country.\n\nA combined 3.572 billion unique viewers (live global 1-minute reach) – more than half of the global population aged four and over – tuned in to world football\'s ultimate competition, according to audience data for official broadcast coverage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe average global live audience for every game of the tournament was 191 million viewers (for a cumulative live audience of 12.224 billion viewers), a 2.1% increase over the 2014 tournament average of 187 million viewers, including that average audience in the early stages (group stage and round of 16) were bigger than in 2014.However, in 2018, the audience was 15 percent smaller for the semi-finals, 17 percent for the third place play-off, and 5.1 percent for the final, which was watched by 517 million people on average (only in-home TV viewers), compared to 545 million in 2014.Presumably, the reason for that is the smaller countries involved in the top four games compared to those in 2014, and only one global region (Europe) being represented in 2018 (compared to South America and Europe in 2014).However the live global 1-minute reach of the final was 1.12 billion people (884.37 in-home TV viewers and 231.82 million out-of-home and (or) digital-only viewers).\n\nFIFA World Cup FIFA World Cup hosts 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup 2019 FIFA Women\'s World Cup\n', 'Claim_Context': ""Croatian player Luka Modrić

(35 days) was the longest government shutdown in history and the second and final federal government shutdown involving furloughs during the presidency of Donald Trump.It occurred when the 115th Congress and Trump could not agree on an appropriations bill to fund the operations of the federal government for the 2019 fiscal year, or a temporary continuing resolution that would extend the deadline for passing a bill.The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal departments or agencies from conducting non-essential operations without appropriations legislation in place.As a result, nine executive departments with around 800,000 employees had to shut down partially or in full, affecting about one-fourth of government activities and causing employees to be furloughed or required to work without being paid.The Congressional Budget Office estimated the shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion USD, excluding indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.\n\nThe shutdown stemmed from an impasse over Trump\'s demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall.In December 2018, the Senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the bill appeared likely to be approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Trump.After Trump faced heavy criticism from some right-wing media outlets and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to ""build the wall"", he announced that he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund its construction.As a result, the House passed a stopgap bill with funding for the wall, but it was blocked in the Senate by the threat of a Democratic filibuster.\n\nIn January 2019, representatives elected in the November 2018 election took office, giving the Democrats a majority in the House.The House immediately voted to approve the appropriations bill that had previously passed the Senate unanimously (which included no funding for the wall).For several weeks, Trump continued to maintain that he would veto any bill that did not fund an entire border wall, and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the Senate from considering any appropriations legislation that Trump would not support, including the bill that had previously passed.Democrats and some Republicans opposed the shutdown and passed multiple bills to reopen the government, arguing that the government shutdown amounted to ""hostage-taking"" civil servants and that negotiations could only begin once the government was reopened.\n\nOn January 25, 2019, Trump agreed to endorse a stopgap bill to reopen the government for three weeks up until February 15 to allow for negotiations to take place to approve an appropriations bill that both parties could agree on.However, Trump reiterated his demand for the border wall funding and said that he would shut down the government again or declare a national emergency and use military funding to build the wall if Congress did not appropriate the funds by February 15.\n\nTrump\'s approval rating dropped during the shutdown.A majority of Americans opposed exploitation of the shutdown as a negotiating strategy and held Trump responsible for the shutdown: A CBS News poll found that 71% of Americans considered the border wall ""not worth the shutdown"" and a Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 53% of Americans blamed Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, compared to 34% who blamed Democrats and 10% who blamed both parties.\n\nOn February 15, 2019, Trump declared a national emergency to fund the wall and bypass Congress, after being unsatisfied with a bipartisan border bill that had passed the House and the Senate a day before.\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign, then-candidate Trump promised to build a wall along the Mexico–United States border for which Mexico would pay.The president of Mexico rejected the idea of providing any funding for a U.S. border wall.In 2018, Trump requested $ in federal funding for some of barrier on the border, mostly to replace of aging fence built under the Secure Fence Act of 2006.On December 25, 2018, Trump reversed course, suggesting that he might accept of either mostly refurbished barrier (rather than new barriers in locations that did not previously have them) by November 2020.Trump\'s proposals and public statements on the wall have shifted widely over time, with varied proposals as to the design, material, length, height, and width of a wall.\n\nIn September 2018, Congress passed two ""minibus"" appropriations bills for the 2019 United States federal budget, which began on October 1, 2018.These bills combined five of the 12 regular appropriations bills covering 77% of federal discretionary funding, and included a continuing resolution until December 7 for the remaining agencies.On December 6, Congress passed a second continuing resolution to December 21, to give more time for negotiations on Trump\'s proposed border wall, which had been delayed due to the funeral of George H. W. Bush.\n\nA Senate Homeland Security appropriations bill, negotiated by both parties and reported by the committee to the Senate, provided for $ for border security, including funds for ""approximately 65 miles of pedestrian fencing along the southwest border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector"".The bill did not receive a vote on the Senate floor, although House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer indicated that such a proposal could be acceptable to House Democrats.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said the Democratic Party would not support $ for the border wall.At a press conference before the government shutdown, he noted ""the $1.6 billion for border security negotiated by Democrats and Republicans is our position.We believe that is the right way to go.""\n\nOn December 11, President Trump held a televised meeting with Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in the Oval Office and asked them to support an appropriation of $5.7 billion for funding of a border wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico.They refused, resulting in an argument between Trump and both Congressional leaders.During the contentious discussion, Trump remarked, ""I am proud to shut down the government for border security ...I will be the one to shut [the government] down.I\'m not going to blame you for it ...I will take the mantle.I will be the one to shut it down.""Schumer replied, ""We shouldn\'t shut down the government over a dispute.""Ten days later, Trump blamed Democrats for the impending shutdown.\n\nThree days later, Politico reported that Trump was willing to sign a bill with no funding for a border wall that delayed a government shutdown into 2019 and the new Congress.On December 18, following a meeting with Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the government would not shut down on December 22 and that Trump was ""flexible"" over funding for a border wall.Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby commented that the most likely resolution was a bill that funded the government until early February.Schumer added that his caucus would ""very seriously"" consider such a bill and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said ""I don\'t know anybody on the Hill that wants a shutdown, and I think all the president\'s advisers are telling him this would not be good.""\n\nOn December 19, the Senate passed a second continuing resolution () that would fund the government until February 8, 2019.Pelosi announced that House Democrats would support the measure, meaning it would overcome opposition from conservative Republicans and pass the House.On December 20, following increased criticism from conservative media, pundits, and political figures, Trump reversed his position and declared that he would not sign any funding bill that did not include border wall funding.The same day, the House passed a continuing resolution that included $5 billion for the wall and $8 billion in disaster aid.This bill failed in the Senate.Trump\'s changing position caused consternation among Senate Republicans.\n\nThe shutdown started December 22 and Trump announced that he would cancel his planned trip to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas and stay in Washington, D.C.The meaning of the term ""wall"" was expected to be an aspect of the negotiations.\n\nCongress adjourned on December 22 for the Christmas and holiday season, with many predicting that the shutdown would not be resolved until the start of the 116th Congress.The Senate reconvened on December 27 for four minutes, with Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) presiding over the session.The House briefly reconvened as well, with Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) saying that members should not expect any further votes for the rest of 2018.Representative Jim McGovern (D-MA) went to the House floor to try to force consideration of a short-term funding bill to end the shutdown that the Senate had already passed, but the Republican Speaker-pro-tem refused to let him speak.\n\nCongress then adjourned again until December 31, 2018, for a pro forma session.On January 2, 2019, the last full day of the 115th United States Congress, there was a pro forma session scheduled to last several minutes.\n\nThe new Congress was sworn in on January 3, 2019, and one of the first orders of business in the House after electing the Speaker and swearing in the new members was a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security until February 8 (), which passed by a vote of 239–192; and a package combining five appropriation bills funding the rest of the government for the remainder of the fiscal year (), passed by a vote of 241–190.The bills contained $1.3 billion of funding for border security, but no additional funding for a border wall.\n\nBeginning on January 9, the Democratic-controlled House voted on four appropriations bills individually:\n\nFinancial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Treasury (including the Internal Revenue Service), federal judiciary, District of Columbia, and a number of independent agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, General Services Administration, and Securities and Exchange Commission.The House passed the legislation on January 9, on a 240–188 vote, with every Democrat and eight Republicans voting yes, and all other Republicans voting no. Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Department of Agriculture (including food stamps), the Food and Drug Administration, and related entities.On January 10, the House passed this bill 243–183.Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore Transportation and Housing and Urban Development (including some federal mortgage programs).On January 10, the House passed this bill 244–180.Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Interior Department, Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies, including the Smithsonian Institution.On January 11, ten House Republicans voted with Democrats in a 240–179 vote to end the shutdown of Interior-Environment programs.It was the most recent of a ""series of standalone appropriations measures"" the House sent to the Senate.\n\nThis strategy has been compared to one used by Republicans during the 2013 shutdown in the form of a series of fourteen mini-continuing resolutions.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed that the Senate would not consider the House bills to reopen the government, indicating that Senate Republicans would not support any bill unless it had Trump\'s support.In January 2019, McConnell and Senate Republicans came under increased pressure to break the impasse and reopen the government.Three Republican Senators—Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Cory Gardner of Colorado—called for an end to the shutdown.Senators Collins and Gardner said they supported the House\'s budget bills to end the shutdown.West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito said that she could support ending the shutdown provided border wall talks continued.Pat Roberts of Kansas said that shutdowns ""never work"" and only turned affected federal workers into ""pawns"" and that, although the time had not yet come for Senate Republicans to override any possible Trump veto and end the shutdown, ""we\'re getting pretty close.""Johnny Isakson of Georgia echoed that sentiment, saying that support for McConnell\'s refusal to support bills that do not include funding for a wall would not last indefinitely: ""There\'s a time when that may run out.""\n\nOn January 16, McConnell again blocked the House appropriation bills to reopen the government from being considered on the Senate floor.The following day, McConnell blocked consideration of bills to reopen most of the closed government agencies for a third time.On January 23, McConnell blocked a bill to reopen most of the government for the fourth time.\n\nOn January 22, McConnell stated that the Senate would be voting on two different bills to end the shutdown on January 24.The first vote is on a bill to reopen the government which includes Trump\'s proposal to provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and temporary protections to some immigration classes.The other bill is a three-week continuing resolution to fund 25% of the government through February 8.\n\nOn January 22, Senator Mark Warner introduced a bill to keep the federal government running in the event of future shutdown events.The bill is called the ""Stop Shutdowns Transferring Unnecessary Pain and Inflicting Damage in the Coming Years Act"" or the ""Stop STUPIDITY Act"".\n\nOn January 24, the Senate held two votes on competing Democratic and Republican proposals to end the shutdown.The Democratic proposal was largely similar to the measure that had previously passed the Senate unanimously in the 115th Congress, and then been passed by the Democratic-controlled House in the 116th Congress.It provided funding for the government with no money for the border wall.The Republican proposal incorporated Trump\'s proposal, which would fund a border wall; temporarily extend TPS and DACA for three years, but would substantially narrow eligibility for DACA; and make significant legal changes to make it more difficult for persons escaping violence and persecution to be granted asylum in the United States.Neither proposal was able to attain the 60 votes needed for passage.The Trump plan failed in a 50–47 vote.The Democratic plan failed in a 52–44 vote.Most Republicans voted for Trump\'s plan and against the Democratic plan.Most Democrats voted for the Democratic plan and against Trump\'s plan.Republicans Tom Cotton and Mike Lee voted against both plans.Democrat Joe Manchin and Republicans Lamar Alexander, Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, Johnny Isakson, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney voted for both plans.Not voting on either were Republicans Rand Paul and Jim Risch and Democrat Jacky Rosen.Republican Richard Burr voted for Trump\'s plan and did not vote on the Democratic plan.\n\nOn January 25, House Democrats prepared a compromise proposal to reopen the government, which would provide $5 billion for border security but no wall construction.However, the shutdown ended the same day.\n\nOn January 4, after the new Congress was sworn-in and Pelosi regained the speakership, she and Schumer, as well as congressional Republican leadership met with Trump at the White House.Pelosi and Schumer argued that the shutdown needed to end and reported that Trump refused.They said that Trump threatened to ""keep the government closed for a very long period of time.Months or even years.""Later that day, Trump admitted to ""absolutely"" making that threat, adding, ""I\'m very proud of doing what I\'m doing.""Trump then said that he was considering declaring a national emergency to use military funding for the wall.At the meeting, Trump reprimanded his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney for attempting to propose a compromise between Trump\'s $5.7 billion demand for a border wall and the Democrats\' proposal of $1.3 billion for border security.\n\nTrump addressed the nation from the Oval Office at 9 p.m. EST on January 8, in a nationally televised address broadcast on both network and cable television.In his speech, Trump asserted that there was a ""growing humanitarian and security crisis"" on the Mexico–United States border that could only be solved by appropriating $5.7 billion for construction of a steel wall.Trump did not make any new proposals in his speech to break the impasse.Immediately after Trump\'s speech, Schumer and Pelosi delivered a response on behalf of the Democrats, in which they demanded an end to the shutdown and said: ""President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government.""\n\nTrump met with congressional leadership again on January 9, in a meeting lasting 14 minutes.Trump asked Pelosi, ""Will you agree to my wall?"" and when she replied that she would not, Trump said ""bye-bye"" and walked out of the meeting, later declaring it ""a total waste of time"".Schumer accused Trump of throwing a ""temper tantrum"" and slamming his hands on the table.Trump rebuked Schumer\'s comments on Twitter.Vice President Mike Pence and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that Trump remained calm and never raised his voice.On January 10, Pelosi described the preceding day\'s meeting with Trump as ""a setup"" staged by White House aides so that Trump could walk out of the meeting.Pelosi described Trump as ""un-presidential""; accused him of ""exploiting this situation in a way that enhances his power""; and said: ""I don\'t think he really wants a solution.I think he loves the distraction.""\n\nAfter Trump walked out of the January 9 meeting with congressional Democratic leaders, no further negotiations were conducted.Several Republican senators met in the office of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, after the meeting to discuss a compromise to end the shutdown.They discussed agreeing to Trump\'s demand for border wall funding and offering the Democrats help for Dreamers, refugee protections and extensions to H-2B visas.On January 13, Graham proposed that Trump agree to a congressional vote to reopen the government pending the resumption of negotiations.Graham suggested that if Trump and congressional Democrats did not come to an agreement at that time, Trump could declare a national emergency.Trump rejected this proposal the next day.\n\nOn January 19, Trump proposed a temporary extension of the two programs that protect about 700,000 immigrants from deportation—Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)—in exchange for funding for the border wall.The protections would be temporary, with no path to citizenship.Trump had previously revoked TPS for people from a number of Latin American and African countries, and taken steps to rescind DACA.In his remarks at the White House, Trump referred to a ""barrier"" rather than a ""wall"" and indicated that he aimed to erect ""steel barriers in high priority locations"" rather than ""a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea.""\n\nIn addition to funding a border wall, the 1,300-page Republican bill released after Trump made his proposal would make major changes to U.S. immigration policy (which were not included in Trump\'s public announcement).The legislation would severely restrict the ability of children from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to apply for asylum in the United States.Specifically, participation in the Central American Minors Program would be subject to an annual cap and migrant children would be barred from applying for asylum in person at the border, and only migrant children with a ""qualified"" parent in the U.S. would be eligible to apply.The bill would also create a new, more burdensome application process for TPS holders, and would exclude TPS holders from Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen.The American Immigration Lawyers Association government relations director said that the proposal ""would categorically block tens of thousands of children from ever applying for asylum,"" while a Cato Institute immigration analyst wrote that the proposal would not extend DACA, but rather replace it with ""a totally different program that will exclude untold thousands of Dreamers who would have been eligible under DACA.""\n\nDemocrats rejected Trump\'s proposal.In a speech on the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""The president\'s proposal is one-sided, harshly partisan and was made in bad faith.The asylum changes are a poison pill, if there ever was one.""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said extending the DACA proposal temporarily was ""unacceptable"" and a ""non-starter"" because it did not ""represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people\'s lives.""Analysts pointed out that Trump had previously rejected a deal that would have provided funding for the border wall in exchange for further protection for DACA recipients.Conversely, Republicans reacted positively to Trump\'s proposal, and Mitch McConnell said he would bring it to a vote in the Senate.\n\nDuring the shutdown, on January 8 in a press conference, a reporter asked Trump if he was considering declaring a national emergency, to which Trump replied, ""I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want"" and suggested that he could declare an emergency.After this, Trump repeatedly threatened to declare a national emergency to unilaterally order wall construction without congressional authorization.Some of Trump\'s advisors, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, reportedly attempted to dissuade him from doing so.Administration officials considered diverting hurricane-relief and wildfire-relief funds from a $13.9 billion February 2018 emergency supplemental appropriations bill (for disaster relief in Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California, among other places) in order to fund a wall, and directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to look into this possibility.\n\nAn attempt by Trump to invoke emergency powers would almost certainly have prompted a lengthy legal challenge in court.Democrats responded that Trump lacked the authority to declare a national emergency; Representative Adam Schiff called it a ""non-starter"" and said that ""if Harry Truman couldn\'t nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this President doesn\'t have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion dollar wall on the border.""Democratic Representative Nydia Velázquez said the notion of redirecting disaster-relief funds to a border wall was ""beyond appalling"".Presidents have declared emergencies in the past, but none has ""involved funding a policy goal after failing to win congressional approval"".Yale Law School professor Bruce Ackerman wrote that the declaration of a national emergency to build a wall as Trump suggested would be unconstitutional and illegal.Other scholars, such as Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice, believed that Trump could make a colorable argument that diverting military-construction appropriations for border-wall construction was legal, but that doing so would be an abuse of power.Law professor Ilya Somin stated that in the unlikely case that Trump succeeded in using the emergency powers in this way, it would set a dangerous precedent, which Republicans would come to regret next time the president was a Democrat.\n\nOn January 11, Trump—while maintaining he has the authority to do so anytime—said he was not in any rush to declare a national emergency to secure wall funding, saying he would rather see Congress ""do its job"" and that the Democrats ""should come back and vote.""The next day he again threatened to use emergency powers if Democrats did not ""come to their senses.""\n\nOn January 16, Pelosi sent a letter to Trump that indicated the House would be unavailable for the 2019 State of the Union Address that was scheduled for January 29.Pelosi wrote, ""Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government reopens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has reopened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on Jan. 29.""The delivery of the State of the Union address had been delayed or substantially changed on only two occasions since 1913.In a letter sent to the Speaker the next day, Trump said she would not be allowed to take military transport aircraft on scheduled visits to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan.Trump replied, ""We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the shutdown is over.""Pelosi and a congressional delegation had planned on visiting overseas American military personnel.\n\nOn January 23, Trump sent a letter to Pelosi insisting that there were no security concerns and that he would hold the State of the Union Address as scheduled.Trump wrote, ""Therefore, I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and Congress of the United States of America regarding the State of our Union.""In a letter sent in reply, Pelosi stated that the House would not consider a concurrent resolution to authorize the State of the Union Address in the House Chamber until the shutdown ended, writing, ""Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened.""\n\nTrump later stated he would look for an alternative, but then retracted that statement in a pair of tweets announcing that he would wait until the end of the shutdown to give the address in the House Chamber.\n\nOn January 25, Trump announced his support for a three-week funding measure that would reopen the government until February 15.The deal, which also moved forward with long-term Department of Homeland Security funding, did not include funds for a wall.As expected, the agreement provided federal employees with back pay.Both the Senate and House of Representatives passed the funding measure by voice vote, sending the resolution to the President\'s desk.Trump signed the bill the same day, ending the shutdown.\n\nLater in January, Republican senators voted unanimously against a bill to provide back pay to federal contractors.\n\nWithout legislation enacted by February 15, a new partial shutdown would have begun, three weeks after the last ended.A bipartisan group of senators and representatives reached an agreement ""in principle"" on February 11, but Trump did not say whether he would sign it.Included was $1.375 billion for 55 miles of steel border fencing.On February 13, it was reported that, against the wishes of Democratic leaders and many Republicans, Trump was blocking the provision of back pay to federal contractors who were still out of pocket from the shutdown.Both houses passed the bill February 14 with enough votes to override a veto if that happened.\n\nOn February 15, at the White House Rose Garden, Trump announced that he had signed the spending bill to keep the government open.He also declared a national emergency, hoping to get access to $8 billion to use for border security.\n\nAgencies funded by two ""minibus"" appropriations bills passed in September 2018 were not affected by the shutdown.About 380,000 federal employees were furloughed, and an additional 420,000 employees for the affected agencies were expected to work with their pay delayed until the end of the shutdown, totaling 800,000 workers affected out of 2.1 million civilian non-postal federal employees.As only about a quarter of the government was shut down, many people who are not federal employees did not fully realize the effects of the shutdown.\n\nAccording to and , these were the affected agencies:\n\nDepartment of State Department of the Treasury Department of Justice Most of the Department of the Interior Department of Agriculture Department of Commerce Department of Housing and Urban Development Department of Transportation Department of Homeland Security Some Department of Health and Human Services agencies Food and Drug Administration Indian Health Service Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Superfund Research Program Executive Office of the President Most independent agencies Judicial Branch\n\nUnaffected agencies include, according to and :\n\nDepartment of Defense Department of Labor Most of the Department of Health and Human Services Department of Energy Department of Education Department of Veterans Affairs Some Department of the Interior agencies Bureau of Reclamation Central Utah Project District of Columbia (excluding courts) Legislative Branch Social Security Administration Nuclear Regulatory Commission Appalachian Regional Commission Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board Delta Regional Authority Denali Commission Northern Border Regional Commission Southeast Crescent Regional Commission Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board American Battle Monuments Commission U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Cemeterial Expenses of the Army, including Arlington National Cemetery and Soldiers\' and Airmen\'s Home National Cemetery Armed Forces Retirement Home Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System Fund Intelligence Community Management Account Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled Corporation for National and Community Service Corporation for Public Broadcasting Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission Institute of Museum and Library Services Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission Medicare Payment Advisory Commission National Council on Disability National Labor Relations Board National Mediation Board Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission Railroad Retirement Board\n\nJobs affected included staff throughout the United States, not just DC area employees.FBI agents, federal corrections officers, FDA inspectors, NASA employees, TSA staff, Border Patrol staff and CBP officers, census staff, National Park Service staff, members of the Coast Guard, and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers either worked without pay or were furloughed, with increasing numbers of unpaid essential employees failing to show up for work.\n\nOn January 11, 800,000 workers for agencies shutdown or furloughed missed their first paycheck.Federal workers normally receive pay on federal holidays, which include Christmas, New Year\'s Day and potentially Martin Luther King Jr. Day.The shutdown affected the employees\' entitlement to paid holidays due to the shutdown.Unemployment assistance to federal workers furloughed under the government shutdown varied by locality.Only non-reporting workers were eligible for assistance, whereas furloughed workers who still reported to work were not.Workers who received unemployment assistance were required pay it back after the shut down ended and they received backpay.Some furloughed workers sought other employment opportunities while they were idled.However, external employment must meet agency-specific ethics guidelines, and mandatory reviews of external employment were also curtailed as most ethics officials were also furloughed.Federal employees were not able to use vacation or sick leave during the shutdown so scheduled holiday vacation time either became unpaid if the worker was deemed non-essential or was cancelled if the worker was deemed essential.In many cases unused leave over a certain threshold expired at year-end, but employees who had leave scheduled in advance of the shutdown did not have ""use or lose"" leave balances deducted from their accrued leave.Many furloughed employees took to crowd-funding campaigns to raise cash to replace missed paychecks, but these types of solicitations also run afoul of government ethics rules.\n\nAs furloughed federal workers and their families shared stories of their hardships, such as not being able to meet rent or mortgage payments and missed bills, the hashtag ""#ShutdownStories"" went viral on social media.The federal government\'s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) responded by publishing sample letters that employees could send to their creditors.One read, in part, ""I am a Federal employee who has recently been furloughed due to a lack of funding of my agency.Because of this, my income has been severely cut and I am unable to pay the entire cost of my mortgage, along with my other expenses.""Other federal workers reached out to other news outlets to share stories about having to stretch their budgets and the impact of the shutdown on their families.In addition to being unable to meet rent or pay bills, many federal workers around the country were unable to pay for groceries and turned to food banks.One federal prison guard in Louisiana attempted suicide after posting about the financial pressures of the shutdown on Facebook.\n\nThe OPM also suggested that employees who had landlords write: ""I would like to discuss with you the possibility of trading my services to perform maintenance (e.g. painting, carpentry work) in exchange for partial rent payments"" and suggested those who lacked funds to pay bills should hire personal attorneys to assist them.Other organizations also posted advice on how to ""find supplemental income""; the Coast Guard suggested that Coast Guard members ""have a garage sale, offer to watch children, walk pets or house sit"" while furloughed.\n\nOn January 4, The Washington Post reported that because the shutdown was triggered by the failure to enact spending bills that continued a federal government pay freeze, hundreds of senior Trump administration political appointees would receive a roughly $10,000 pay raise the following day.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the pending pay raise was an ""unnecessary byproduct of the shutdown.""\n\nOn January 10, the Senate approved by unanimous consent a bill (S.24, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019) providing that furloughed federal employees would receive back pay for the period of the furlough once appropriations were restored; the bill was approved the next day by the House on a vote of 411–7.Trump signed the bill into law on January 16.\n\nNative American tribes were not paid for treaties negotiated with the United States government.These treaties specified that the federal government must provide funding for health clinics, employee salaries, education, infrastructure and other services, which were not paid during the shutdown.Native lands are ""owned, managed and maintained by the federal government.""Native Americans who receive a per capita check for profits from oil and gas sales from tribal land did not receive check for the month of February.Roads were not plowed on tribal land, and some areas received significant snowfall.This caused people of the Navajo Nation to become trapped inside their homes.Food services, which fed 90,000 Native Americans in 2017, were halted.\n\nNative American communities had a high percentage of individuals who worked for the federal government and lost income during the shutdown.In North and South Dakota, one of the largest employers is the Indian Health Service.The Chippewa tribe reported an economic loss of nearly $100,000 daily in funds that the federal government was supposed to provide as a treaty obligation.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was closed for the shutdown.However, 60 percent of the Indian Health Service (IHS) continued to work without pay.IHS provides care for 2.2 million Native Americans and on January 23, began to deny care that was not considered ""life threatening.""The Bureau of Indian Education was able to stay open because it was funded on a different schedule.Unlike other government shutdowns, there was little outreach from the Trump Administration to Native Americans and the Chippewa tribe in Michigan was given a 24-hour notice that the shutdown would take place and affect the tribe.\n\nThe only military branch that was affected by the shutdown was the Coast Guard because it was part of the Department of Homeland Security, while the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps were all funded through the Department of Defense.Officials were able to fund payment on December 31, 2018, but were not able to do so for the paychecks of January 15 and 30, 2019, along with the pay and benefits for civilian workers and retirees.During the shutdown, the Coast Guard continued to engage in patrolling the American coastline and carrying out overseas missions in locations such as the Persian Gulf along with the Navy and in the Caribbean.Other issues arose in the payment processes for Coast Guard members Tricare Health and Dental Program payments, although the individuals were still covered.\n\nMilitary schools, such as the Coast Guard Academy and the National War College, lost funding due to the shutdown and the schools had to work to find funds to pay professors.\n\nAlthough the Department of Defense was not shut down, the February 4, 2019, date for release of the Pentagon\'s 2020 budget was delayed by at least one month.This had repercussions on the interim period which is usually used by Pentagon planners for adjustments before the 2020 fiscal year which will begin in October 2019.The White House Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the Pentagon request, was shut down when the Pentagon budget arrived in December, and remained inactive, so no work was done on the budget.\n\nOn February 25, 2019, the Pentagon\'s counter-drug (interdiction) funding has up to $85 million not yet obligated, but that money was planned for the known corridors in El Paso, Tucson, Yuma, and El Centro for border fencing, lighting, and road projects, so any funds which might possibly be intended for additional projects elsewhere along the border must be obligated by September 30, 2019, in order not to affect the known corridors.Otherwise appropriations above the $85 million not yet obligated for additional interdiction border projects will have to be approved by additional Congressional appropriations, to reach the $2 billion target.\n\nA January 28, 2019 Congressional Budget Office report estimated that the 35-day partial government shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion, including $3 billion in permanent losses; the CBO estimate excluded indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.The furloughing of 145,000 federal workers and 112,500 federal contractors in the Washington Metropolitan Area cost the regional economy $119 million each day, or 7.3% of the region\'s total output.That reduced GDP by over $2.8 billion in the Washington DC area alone.The shutdown also had a noticeable impact on hunger in the national capital region: food pantries in Washington DC and Northern Virginia reported an increase of around 10% in the number of people coming to pick up groceries, with most of that increase coming from federal workers and contractors.\n\nFitch Ratings warned that an extended shutdown might lead to a downgrade in the U.S.\'s Triple-A credit rating if lawmakers were unable to pass a budget or manage the debt ceiling.That in turn would make borrowing more costly for companies and American households, because it is the benchmark for many other lines of credit.The only time the U.S. credit rating has been downgraded by S&P was during the United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011.\n\nSome economists believed that an extended shutdown would weaken consumer confidence and heighten the risk of pushing the U.S. economy into a recession.Between 800,000 federal government employees and some 4 million federal contractors, the shutdown directly affected nearly 3% of the labor force of the United States; in a typical recession, unemployment increases 2–4%.The reduction in spending by those households combined with the reduction of government services could have macroeconomic results similar to a typical recession.The shutdown had an adverse effect on the budgets of state and local governments, as states covered some federal services (particularly the most vulnerable) during the shutdown.\n\nBy mid-January 2019, the White House Council of Economic Advisors estimated that each week of the shutdown reduced GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, the equivalent of 1.2 points per quarter.CEA chairman Kevin Hassett later acknowledged that GDP growth could decline to zero in the first quarter of 2019 if the shutdown lasted the entire quarter.\n\nAs tax season began in the United States on January 28, some 46,000 Internal Revenue Service workers were called back to work to ensure tax refunds and returns were not affected by the shutdown.The recalled workers allowed the department to continue operations that were automatic and those deemed necessary for the safety of human life or protection of government property, such as processing electronic returns, returns with payments, mailing tax forms, appeals, criminal law enforcement investigations and technical support.\n\nDuring the shutdown, 95% of federal staff for the USDA\'s Food and Nutrition Services were furloughed.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the food-stamp program, could be funded through a $3 billion contingency fund appropriated by Congress in 2018; if the shutdown had continued through March 2019, those funds would have been exhausted, leaving some 38 million Americans without food stamps and endangering food security.Concerns were raised that continuation of the shutdown could delay the issuance of some $140 billion in tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees most of the food supply in the U.S.In early January, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner, reported that the FDA suspended food inspections.He noted that inspection of foreign food was continuing as ""almost normal,"" because they are considered vital.Around January 14, ""high-risk"" food inspections resumed.As of January 22, 2019, 46 percent of the FDA were working, though 20 percent of them were working without pay.During the shutdown, two new recalls for contamination with Listeria or Salmonella took place.Consumer advocacy groups advised of food safety issues during the shutdown.Food safety attorney, Bill Marler, advocated against eating ""fresh, uncooked products on the market place.""Because there was a shortage of FDA inspectors, many imported perishable items, such as produce or flowers, were at risk of spoilage.Meat and some egg products are inspected by the USDA\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service.Federal legislation required those inspectors to remain working without pay.\n\nSchool administrations raised concern about how to feed children who purchase food at the schools for lunch, as funding concerns caused some districts to conserve food and funding.Many limited the amount or variation of foods available for the children to purchase, and alerted parents to the concerns and the limited availability of some of the items.Most schools affected were in high-poverty areas, and depended on federally funded lunch programs, such as the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) a federal grant established by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 and operated through the Department of Agriculture.Some 22 million students in nearly 100,000 schools received school meals through that operation.\n\nAs with the January 2018 shutdown, national parks were expected to be open to the extent practical, though there would be no staff and buildings would be closed.The shutdown affected national parks unevenly, some were accessible with bare-bones staffing levels, some operated with money from states or charitable groups, and others were locked off.Diane Regas, president and chief executive of the Trust for Public Land, called upon Trump to close all national parks to protect the public: by the third week of the shutdown, three people had died in national parks.This number was reported as being within \'usual\' levels.At Yosemite National Park, on January 4, 2019, a death from a fall went unreported for a week.\n\nBy January 1, 2019, the problems of neglected trash pileup, overflowing public toilets, and access to first aid were repeated across the Park system.Health and safety concerns were raised, with concerns by scientists that the expansive amount of garbage and human waste could impact water and soil quality, or cause damage to animals in the parks.Other issues that arose due to the shutdown included illegal campsites, protected agriculture being damaged, damaging of government property and trespassing on foot and by vehicle.\n\nNew York kept the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open, as it did during the January 2018 shutdown.Arizona and Utah were able to keep Grand Canyon National Park, Zion National Park, Arches National Park, and Bryce Canyon National Park open and provided services including public restrooms, shuttles and trash collection.Utah\'s funding included visitor centers.The sites closed outright in the southwest alone included Bandelier National Monument and Valles Caldera National Preserve in northern New Mexico, White Sands National Monument in southern New Mexico, Petrified Forest National Park in northern Arizona and Casa Grande Ruins National Monument in south-central Arizona.Access to major parts of Sequoia and Kings Canyon parks were closed, and at Joshua Tree National Park, the administration policy of leaving parks open to visitors despite the staff furloughs resulted in park damage, including the toppling of protected trees.In Texas, Big Bend National Park had no visitor services, such as restrooms.Some trailheads were closed.Regulations continued to be enforced, as the park remained open.Visitors were reminded to remove their own trash and toilet paper.The Alamo remained open but no NPS services were available at the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park.Channel Islands National Park remained open to public access, although services normally provided by the national park service were instead provided by Island Packers Cruises, the company normally in charge of ferries to the islands.\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration closed immediately on December 22, 2018.The Library of Congress, the U.S. Botanic Garden, the Capitol Visitor Center, and the U.S. Capitol Building remained open as they were funded by the 2019 Legislative Branch appropriations bill.The Smithsonian Institution operated on ""prior-year funds"" through January 1, 2019.On January 2, 2019, the Smithsonian Institution initiated an orderly shutdown of all its facilities, including 19 museums in Washington, D.C., and New York City, the National Zoo, and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.The following day, the National Gallery of Art was closed.The National Zoo also closed on January 3, 2019.Tourism attendance on the National Mall was affected.On January 5, 2019, acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt directed the diversion of fee revenue defined by the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to be used to fund minimal maintenance activities so as to preserve access to highly visited parks.\n\nAccording to a January 12, 2019, article in The Economist, on January 11, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was unable to pay its workers who had not been paid since December 22; 55% more of them called in sick than in January 2018.\n\nAs the air traffic controllers were deemed essential employees, they were required to work without pay.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents air traffic controllers, filed a lawsuit against the federal government for the shutdown on January 11, 2019, claiming that requiring 16,000 air traffic controllers to work without being paid violated their constitutional rights and federal minimum wage law.That was the third lawsuit filed against the federal government since the beginning of the shutdown.\n\nAirline and aircraft safety inspectors, on the other hand, were deemed nonessential and furloughed.A news report on January 12, 2019, stated that the Federal Aviation Administration had returned 500 furloughed safety inspectors back to work and would return more to work in the following weeks.As the airline and aircraft safety inspectors were furloughed, the certification process of the Airbus A220 in the US was stalled.Delta Air Lines was forced to delay the launch of the new aircraft, and to use other models of aircraft to serve those routes that was supposed to be served with A220.Many TSA employees also called out sick, most of them because they were trying to find other jobs that would provide immediate paychecks.\n\nThe shutdown initially prevented the National Transportation Safety Board from assisting the Mexican government\'s investigation of the 2018 Puebla helicopter crash that killed a state governor and senator; an exception allowed the NTSB to assist with the Mexican government in the investigation along with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.The NTSB also had to delay several investigations until the government reopened and only continued investigations into accidents that were considered the most serious.Issues in receiving certification and oversight from the FAA led to a month-long delay in the commencement of passenger service at Paine Field in Everett, Washington.\n\nAs the shutdown continued into its fourth week, the unions representing airline pilots, flight attendants and air traffic controllers issued a statement asserting, ""we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play"" because of the shutdown.\n\nSome airports such as the Philadelphia International Airport, launched food and item donations for federal employees who were affected by the shutdown.Other airports such as the Miami International Airport, and the George Bush International Airport, closed down terminals in order to spread out the TSA workers that were available.\n\nOn January 25, flights destined for LaGuardia Airport in New York were halted to a groundstop by FAA officials due to staffing shortages directly as a result of the shutdown.As a result, several flights to and from neighboring airports in the Northeast, specifically Philadelphia and Newark, suffered significant delays of their own.Soon after that, appropriations passed and the government reopened.\n\nThe shutdown delayed software updates to the Boeing 737 MAX airplane which may have caused the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.\n\nDuring the shutdown, court-appointed private lawyers who represent indigent defendants worked without pay.The Federal Judiciary initially had a goal of sustaining paid operations through January 18, 2019.It said it would run out of money to sustain court operations no earlier than January 25, but perhaps as late as February 1.Failing funding, the Judiciary would operate under the terms of the Antideficiency Act.This Act does not allow federal agencies to expend federal funds before an appropriation, nor to accept any voluntary services.The judiciary had 33,000 employees nationwide.Under the Constitution, Supreme Court Justices, appeals court judges and district judges would continue to be paid.\n\nThe shutdown caused many delays and disruptions in cases.Budgets were watched carefully to be able to pay public defenders, DNA testing, informants, and travel costs to interview victims and witnesses.Staffing issues also brought about concerns and constraints with prisons lacking the staff to safely hold attorney-client visits, and caused a delay in bail hearings.\n\nAgents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed in a report released on January 22, 2019, by the FBI Agents Association, that several different investigations were compromised by the shutdown.The report was called ""Voices from the Field"" and was 72 pages long.FBI agents were unable to pay Confidential Human Sources which risks losing that informant permanently.Some FBI divisions no longer have Spanish-speaking staff on hand and could not work with informants who only speak Spanish.Some agents reported that they did not have the funds to assist in joint operations with local law enforcement.\n\nFederal law enforcement agencies working on Native American land worked without pay through the shutdown.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was forced to cancel a trip to the United States/Mexico border in early January due to the shutdown.DHS was also unable to inspect Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities during the shutdown to ensure that immigrants were being held in facilities appropriately.During the shutdown, the federal government\'s e-Verify system—a system for employers to check the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States—was halted.\n\nDuring the shutdown, a wave of Domain Name System (DNS) attacks on government sites was detected by Homeland Security.The attacks were serious because these Internet sites could be hijacked.\n\nOfficial websites for agencies were rendered insecure or inaccessible through the shutdown, as the expired digital certificates were not renewed.On January 23, DHS asked all government agencies to secure their DNS records; however, many agencies were not able to respond quickly to this request.\n\nExecutive and legislative affairs of the local government of the District of Columbia continued operating through the shutdown, due to a provision previously enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017.The District\'s local court system, including the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, are part of the federal judiciary.Thus, they were partially shut down, preventing District residents from accessing services such as marriage licensing.The District of Columbia government said it would take over trash collection and snow plowing operations for National Park Service facilities in Washington.\n\nThe shutdown also interfered with the response to the 2018 Sunda Strait tsunami, as the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta\'s Twitter account was unable to tweet updates, and the United States Geological Survey was unable to provide data on the tsunami.The American weather model, the GFS, suffered a significant drop in forecast quality when a data format change during the shutdown prevented certain weather data from being recognized by the GFS, and the shutdown prevented the bug from being corrected.\n\nBy mid-day Thursday, January 3, 2019, the FCC had suspended operations.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai canceled his trip to the Consumer Electronics Show.The FTC also suspended certain online operations.The EPA and Department of Energy\'s Energy Star website was not available for the duration of the shutdown.\n\nMakers of alcoholic beverages were unable to receive approval from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau for new labels and recipes during the shutdown.\n\nBased on the recalculation of their operating reserves, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) would have had to cease patent operations in the second week of February.A cadre of personnel was allocated to continue receiving patent applications, receive payments, and maintain the IT infrastructure.Even though the USPTO is self-funded, a Congressional appropriation is required to permit the USPTO to spend money.The pipeline of patent applications at the time took 15.8 months for a response from an examiner.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution shortened to two days and downscaled its scheduled ten-day 2019 Folklife Festival on the National Mall because of the shutdown\'s effects.Sabrina Motley, the director of the festival, said that initially, crucial funding for the June—July event arrived later than expected, slowing preparations.Motley stated: ""The government opened back up, but it took a while for systems to come back online. ...We looked at our production schedule, and it became clear we would need more time than we had.""\n\nThe White House residence staff who stage public receptions were among those furloughed, with a minimal staff continuing to work unpaid for the first family.In the midst of the shutdown Trump invited the Clemson Tigers football team to a White House dinner reception on January 14 in recognition of their College Football Playoff National Championship win.On the morning of the reception Trump announced that he intended to serve fast food hamburgers and pizza to the team, a remark that some commentators interpreted as a joke.That evening Trump welcomed the team in the State Dining Room with a buffet of fast food and pizza from McDonald\'s, Wendy\'s and other restaurant chains, which he stated that he had paid for personally.Trump served fast food to other visiting athletes later that year, after the shutdown had ended.\n\nOn January 10, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with several other unions, announced plans to protest the government shutdown at 1:00pm EST in Washington, DC.Leaders of the National Federation of Federal Employees stated they had hoped that bringing federal workers to the President\'s doorstep would show him that it was the individual workers that the shutdown was hurting the most.President Trump had left to visit the US–Mexican border in Texas earlier in the day.\n\nSimilar protests took place in Philadelphia and St. Louis, among other cities.On January 15, representatives for Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, and Vietnam Veterans of America along with others called for an end to shutdown, but avoided placing any blame on political parties.\n\nShortly after the protests, the American Federation of Government Employees sued the Trump administration to challenge the arrangements for work without pay during the shutdown.A similar suit was raised and won during the 2013 Federal Government shutdown.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association also sued the Trump administration, as the shutdown allegedly violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by failing to pay the workers at least a minimum wage during the shutdown.\n\nAs the salaries for members of Congress are written into permanent law and not funded through annual appropriations, the government shutdown did not affect their salaries.Senators and Representatives were still paid their biweekly salaries of $6,700 towards at least $174,000 a year.\n\nSeveral Democratic and Republican Senators and Representatives said they would donate or refuse their salary during the shutdown.Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw stated that he would refuse his salary, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto indicated she would donate hers to a Nevada charity, Senator Mazie Hirono said she would donate her salary to Hawaii food banks, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would give hers to refugee non-profit HIAS, New York Congressman Max Rose stated that he would give his salary to charity and outgoing Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota pledged hers to charity, along with her Republican colleague John Hoeven.Republican senator Kevin Cramer, who defeated Heidi Heitkamp in the 2018 midterm elections, refused to donate his salary, calling the move ""gimmicky"".Representative Brian Fitzpatrick urged all members of Congress to decline their paychecks.He said, ""If you\'re in Congress, don\'t just delay your pay -- forfeit it, write a check back to the US Treasury.Then you\'ll feel the pain of federal workers.""\n\nBy January 17, 2019, 102 members of Congress—20 Senators and 82 Representatives— chose to decline their paychecks or were donating their paychecks to charity.\n\nDuring the shutdown, many federal workers used food banks and food pantries in order to feed themselves and their families.Many food pantries waived certain restrictions in order to help government workers have access to food.During the shutdown, the Salvation Army Emergency Disasters Services program provided meals for federal workers.Chef Jose Andres created the #ChefsForFeds program to feed federal workers in Washington, D.C. and by January 21, made announcements to expand the program nationwide.\n\nSome states such as California, offered furloughed employees unemployment benefits, although the Trump administration allegedly told states that they could not do so with federal funds.Organizations such as state Attorney Generals offices, and credit card companies posted statements to their websites to offer a means to help to consolidate debt, meet mortgages or other payments such as child support or tuition.An employment law firm offered pro bono legal advice to furloughed federal employees.School districts opened up free or reduced lunch options for children of federal employees, and looked into other options to aid parents amid concerns that financial stress at home would adversely affect families and children.Every mainline denomination in America has contributed to efforts to provide relief.One Baptist church emptied its entire disaster fund to aid federal employees.\n\nOn January 24, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross downplayed the financial difficulties faced by the 800,000 federal workers affected by the shutdown, stating that they should borrow money to ""tide them over"" until the shutdown ends.Critics and Democrats criticized the statement as inappropriate, noting that Ross\' own net worth is estimated at almost $700 million, accusing him of being out of touch with the workers.Ross also said that he ""did not understand"" why people who were not getting paid due to the shutdown were visiting food banks.When asked about Ross\' statement, Trump suggested that grocery stores will ""work along"" with the government by voluntarily extending credit to those who are out of funds to buy food.National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow characterized the shutdown as a ""glitch"" and suggested that federal workers who were required to work without pay were ""volunteering"" to work for their love of the country and ""presumably their allegiance to President Trump.""\n\nIn a video message to staff, FBI director Christopher Wray stated, ""Making some people stay home when they don\'t want to, and making others show up without pay, it\'s mind-boggling, it\'s shortsighted and it\'s unfair.It takes a lot to get me angry, but I\'m about as angry as I\'ve been in a long, long time.""\n\nLara Trump, a daughter-in-law of the President, drew outrage after an interview in which she stated that while ""It\'s not fair to you..."" the shutdown was ""...a little bit of pain, but it\'s going to be for the future of our country, and their children and their grandchildren and generations after them will thank them for their sacrifice right now.""Her comments drew criticism by politicians, celebrities, and the general public who felt the advisor and spokeswoman for the Trump 2020 campaign was out of touch, however Lara Trump later claimed the comments were taken out of context.\n\nIn January 2019, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that 56% of the responding public opposed a wall while 39% favored it, and 45% viewed the situation at the border as a crisis.The numbers were similar to the poll in December 2018 yet a later poll by ABC News showed that as the partial shutdown entered its fourth week support for building a wall was increasing.A poll done through YouGov between December 23–25, 2018, reported that 51% of respondents thought Trump deserved ""a lot"" of the blame, 44% thought congressional Democrats and 39% thought congressional Republicans.Similar results were reported by a December 21–25 survey done by Reuters and Ipsos in which 47% of respondents said that the shutdown was the President\'s fault and 33% blamed Congressional Democrats.\n\nOver the course of the shutdown, Trump\'s approval rating marginally declined while his disapproval rating marginally increased.His net approval rating was by the middle of January 2019 at its lowest point since February 2018.On December 27, 2018, it was reported that Trump\'s approval rating of registered voters was at 39%, with 56% disapproval.Broken down the rating was split across party lines, with Republicans reporting an 80% approval rate while Democrats and independents reported a 90% and 57% disapproval rating, respectively.The poll was conducted through Morning Consult between December 21–23.The poll also reported that 43% of respondents blamed Trump for the shutdown, with 31% blaming congressional Democrats and 7% congressional Republicans.Another poll through The New York Times Upshot/Siena College reported that 89% of voters\' views on Trump and the wall were aligned, suggesting that support for the wall was a function of support for Trump.\n\nThe Washington Post–ABC News poll published on January 13, 2019, found that a larger number of Americans blamed Trump and congressional Republicans than congressional Democrats for the shutdown.A PBS NewsHour–Marist poll found that on January 15, 2019, a majority of Americans thought that President Trump was to blame for the shutdown.A January 2019 poll conducted by telephone for CBS News found that 70% of Americans polled did not want a government shutdown over the issue of building a border wall; 66% believed that Trump should agree to a budget without wall funding.\n\nPresidency of Donald Trump Donald Trump January 2018 United

42,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018–2019 United States federal government shutdown', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The United States federal government shutdown from midnight EST on December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019 (35 days) was the longest government shutdown in history and the second and final federal government shutdown involving furloughs during the presidency of Donald Trump.It occurred when the 115th Congress and Trump could not agree on an appropriations bill to fund the operations of the federal government for the 2019 fiscal year, or a temporary continuing resolution that would extend the deadline for passing a bill.The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal departments or agencies from conducting non-essential operations without appropriations legislation in place.As a result, nine executive departments with around 800,000 employees had to shut down partially or in full, affecting about one-fourth of government activities and causing employees to be furloughed or required to work without being paid.The Congressional Budget Office estimated the shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion USD, excluding indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.\n\nThe shutdown stemmed from an impasse over Trump\'s demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall.In December 2018, the Senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the bill appeared likely to be approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Trump.After Trump faced heavy criticism from some right-wing media outlets and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to ""build the wall"", he announced that he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund its construction.As a result, the House passed a stopgap bill with funding for the wall, but it was blocked in the Senate by the threat of a Democratic filibuster.\n\nIn January 2019, representatives elected in the November 2018 election took office, giving the Democrats a majority in the House.The House immediately voted to approve the appropriations bill that had previously passed the Senate unanimously (which included no funding for the wall).For several weeks, Trump continued to maintain that he would veto any bill that did not fund an entire border wall, and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the Senate from considering any appropriations legislation that Trump would not support, including the bill that had previously passed.Democrats and some Republicans opposed the shutdown and passed multiple bills to reopen the government, arguing that the government shutdown amounted to ""hostage-taking"" civil servants and that negotiations could only begin once the government was reopened.\n\nOn January 25, 2019, Trump agreed to endorse a stopgap bill to reopen the government for three weeks up until February 15 to allow for negotiations to take place to approve an appropriations bill that both parties could agree on.However, Trump reiterated his demand for the border wall funding and said that he would shut down the government again or declare a national emergency and use military funding to build the wall if Congress did not appropriate the funds by February 15.\n\nTrump\'s approval rating dropped during the shutdown.A majority of Americans opposed exploitation of the shutdown as a negotiating strategy and held Trump responsible for the shutdown: A CBS News poll found that 71% of Americans considered the border wall ""not worth the shutdown"" and a Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 53% of Americans blamed Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, compared to 34% who blamed Democrats and 10% who blamed both parties.\n\nOn February 15, 2019, Trump declared a national emergency to fund the wall and bypass Congress, after being unsatisfied with a bipartisan border bill that had passed the House and the Senate a day before.\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign, then-candidate Trump promised to build a wall along the Mexico–United States border for which Mexico would pay.The president of Mexico rejected the idea of providing any funding for a U.S. border wall.In 2018, Trump requested $ in federal funding for some of barrier on the border, mostly to replace of aging fence built under the Secure Fence Act of 2006.On December 25, 2018, Trump reversed course, suggesting that he might accept of either mostly refurbished barrier (rather than new barriers in locations that did not previously have them) by November 2020.Trump\'s proposals and public statements on the wall have shifted widely over time, with varied proposals as to the design, material, length, height, and width of a wall.\n\nIn September 2018, Congress passed two ""minibus"" appropriations bills for the 2019 United States federal budget, which began on October 1, 2018.These bills combined five of the 12 regular appropriations bills covering 77% of federal discretionary funding, and included a continuing resolution until December 7 for the remaining agencies.On December 6, Congress passed a second continuing resolution to December 21, to give more time for negotiations on Trump\'s proposed border wall, which had been delayed due to the funeral of George H. W. Bush.\n\nA Senate Homeland Security appropriations bill, negotiated by both parties and reported by the committee to the Senate, provided for $ for border security, including funds for ""approximately 65 miles of pedestrian fencing along the southwest border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector"".The bill did not receive a vote on the Senate floor, although House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer indicated that such a proposal could be acceptable to House Democrats.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said the Democratic Party would not support $ for the border wall.At a press conference before the government shutdown, he noted ""the $1.6 billion for border security negotiated by Democrats and Republicans is our position.We believe that is the right way to go.""\n\nOn December 11, President Trump held a televised meeting with Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in the Oval Office and asked them to support an appropriation of $5.7 billion for funding of a border wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico.They refused, resulting in an argument between Trump and both Congressional leaders.During the contentious discussion, Trump remarked, ""I am proud to shut down the government for border security ...I will be the one to shut [the government] down.I\'m not going to blame you for it ...I will take the mantle.I will be the one to shut it down.""Schumer replied, ""We shouldn\'t shut down the government over a dispute.""Ten days later, Trump blamed Democrats for the impending shutdown.\n\nThree days later, Politico reported that Trump was willing to sign a bill with no funding for a border wall that delayed a government shutdown into 2019 and the new Congress.On December 18, following a meeting with Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the government would not shut down on December 22 and that Trump was ""flexible"" over funding for a border wall.Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby commented that the most likely resolution was a bill that funded the government until early February.Schumer added that his caucus would ""very seriously"" consider such a bill and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said ""I don\'t know anybody on the Hill that wants a shutdown, and I think all the president\'s advisers are telling him this would not be good.""\n\nOn December 19, the Senate passed a second continuing resolution () that would fund the government until February 8, 2019.Pelosi announced that House Democrats would support the measure, meaning it would overcome opposition from conservative Republicans and pass the House.On December 20, following increased criticism from conservative media, pundits, and political figures, Trump reversed his position and declared that he would not sign any funding bill that did not include border wall funding.The same day, the House passed a continuing resolution that included $5 billion for the wall and $8 billion in disaster aid.This bill failed in the Senate.Trump\'s changing position caused consternation among Senate Republicans.\n\nThe shutdown started December 22 and Trump announced that he would cancel his planned trip to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas and stay in Washington, D.C.The meaning of the term ""wall"" was expected to be an aspect of the negotiations.\n\nCongress adjourned on December 22 for the Christmas and holiday season, with many predicting that the shutdown would not be resolved until the start of the 116th Congress.The Senate reconvened on December 27 for four minutes, with Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) presiding over the session.The House briefly reconvened as well, with Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) saying that members should not expect any further votes for the rest of 2018.Representative Jim McGovern (D-MA) went to the House floor to try to force consideration of a short-term funding bill to end the shutdown that the Senate had already passed, but the Republican Speaker-pro-tem refused to let him speak.\n\nCongress then adjourned again until December 31, 2018, for a pro forma session.On January 2, 2019, the last full day of the 115th United States Congress, there was a pro forma session scheduled to last several minutes.\n\nThe new Congress was sworn in on January 3, 2019, and one of the first orders of business in the House after electing the Speaker and swearing in the new members was a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security until February 8 (), which passed by a vote of 239–192; and a package combining five appropriation bills funding the rest of the government for the remainder of the fiscal year (), passed by a vote of 241–190.The bills contained $1.3 billion of funding for border security, but no additional funding for a border wall.\n\nBeginning on January 9, the Democratic-controlled House voted on four appropriations bills individually:\n\nFinancial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Treasury (including the Internal Revenue Service), federal judiciary, District of Columbia, and a number of independent agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, General Services Administration, and Securities and Exchange Commission.The House passed the legislation on January 9, on a 240–188 vote, with every Democrat and eight Republicans voting yes, and all other Republicans voting no. Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Department of Agriculture (including food stamps), the Food and Drug Administration, and related entities.On January 10, the House passed this bill 243–183.Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore Transportation and Housing and Urban Development (including some federal mortgage programs).On January 10, the House passed this bill 244–180.Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Interior Department, Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies, including the Smithsonian Institution.On January 11, ten House Republicans voted with Democrats in a 240–179 vote to end the shutdown of Interior-Environment programs.It was the most recent of a ""series of standalone appropriations measures"" the House sent to the Senate.\n\nThis strategy has been compared to one used by Republicans during the 2013 shutdown in the form of a series of fourteen mini-continuing resolutions.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed that the Senate would not consider the House bills to reopen the government, indicating that Senate Republicans would not support any bill unless it had Trump\'s support.In January 2019, McConnell and Senate Republicans came under increased pressure to break the impasse and reopen the government.Three Republican Senators—Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Cory Gardner of Colorado—called for an end to the shutdown.Senators Collins and Gardner said they supported the House\'s budget bills to end the shutdown.West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito said that she could support ending the shutdown provided border wall talks continued.Pat Roberts of Kansas said that shutdowns ""never work"" and only turned affected federal workers into ""pawns"" and that, although the time had not yet come for Senate Republicans to override any possible Trump veto and end the shutdown, ""we\'re getting pretty close.""Johnny Isakson of Georgia echoed that sentiment, saying that support for McConnell\'s refusal to support bills that do not include funding for a wall would not last indefinitely: ""There\'s a time when that may run out.""\n\nOn January 16, McConnell again blocked the House appropriation bills to reopen the government from being considered on the Senate floor.The following day, McConnell blocked consideration of bills to reopen most of the closed government agencies for a third time.On January 23, McConnell blocked a bill to reopen most of the government for the fourth time.\n\nOn January 22, McConnell stated that the Senate would be voting on two different bills to end the shutdown on January 24.The first vote is on a bill to reopen the government which includes Trump\'s proposal to provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and temporary protections to some immigration classes.The other bill is a three-week continuing resolution to fund 25% of the government through February 8.\n\nOn January 22, Senator Mark Warner introduced a bill to keep the federal government running in the event of future shutdown events.The bill is called the ""Stop Shutdowns Transferring Unnecessary Pain and Inflicting Damage in the Coming Years Act"" or the ""Stop STUPIDITY Act"".\n\nOn January 24, the Senate held two votes on competing Democratic and Republican proposals to end the shutdown.The Democratic proposal was largely similar to the measure that had previously passed the Senate unanimously in the 115th Congress, and then been passed by the Democratic-controlled House in the 116th Congress.It provided funding for the government with no money for the border wall.The Republican proposal incorporated Trump\'s proposal, which would fund a border wall; temporarily extend TPS and DACA for three years, but would substantially narrow eligibility for DACA; and make significant legal changes to make it more difficult for persons escaping violence and persecution to be granted asylum in the United States.Neither proposal was able to attain the 60 votes needed for passage.The Trump plan failed in a 50–47 vote.The Democratic plan failed in a 52–44 vote.Most Republicans voted for Trump\'s plan and against the Democratic plan.Most Democrats voted for the Democratic plan and against Trump\'s plan.Republicans Tom Cotton and Mike Lee voted against both plans.Democrat Joe Manchin and Republicans Lamar Alexander, Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, Johnny Isakson, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney voted for both plans.Not voting on either were Republicans Rand Paul and Jim Risch and Democrat Jacky Rosen.Republican Richard Burr voted for Trump\'s plan and did not vote on the Democratic plan.\n\nOn January 25, House Democrats prepared a compromise proposal to reopen the government, which would provide $5 billion for border security but no wall construction.However, the shutdown ended the same day.\n\nOn January 4, after the new Congress was sworn-in and Pelosi regained the speakership, she and Schumer, as well as congressional Republican leadership met with Trump at the White House.Pelosi and Schumer argued that the shutdown needed to end and reported that Trump refused.They said that Trump threatened to ""keep the government closed for a very long period of time.Months or even years.""Later that day, Trump admitted to ""absolutely"" making that threat, adding, ""I\'m very proud of doing what I\'m doing.""Trump then said that he was considering declaring a national emergency to use military funding for the wall.At the meeting, Trump reprimanded his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney for attempting to propose a compromise between Trump\'s $5.7 billion demand for a border wall and the Democrats\' proposal of $1.3 billion for border security.\n\nTrump addressed the nation from the Oval Office at 9 p.m. EST on January 8, in a nationally televised address broadcast on both network and cable television.In his speech, Trump asserted that there was a ""growing humanitarian and security crisis"" on the Mexico–United States border that could only be solved by appropriating $5.7 billion for construction of a steel wall.Trump did not make any new proposals in his speech to break the impasse.Immediately after Trump\'s speech, Schumer and Pelosi delivered a response on behalf of the Democrats, in which they demanded an end to the shutdown and said: ""President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government.""\n\nTrump met with congressional leadership again on January 9, in a meeting lasting 14 minutes.Trump asked Pelosi, ""Will you agree to my wall?"" and when she replied that she would not, Trump said ""bye-bye"" and walked out of the meeting, later declaring it ""a total waste of time"".Schumer accused Trump of throwing a ""temper tantrum"" and slamming his hands on the table.Trump rebuked Schumer\'s comments on Twitter.Vice President Mike Pence and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that Trump remained calm and never raised his voice.On January 10, Pelosi described the preceding day\'s meeting with Trump as ""a setup"" staged by White House aides so that Trump could walk out of the meeting.Pelosi described Trump as ""un-presidential""; accused him of ""exploiting this situation in a way that enhances his power""; and said: ""I don\'t think he really wants a solution.I think he loves the distraction.""\n\nAfter Trump walked out of the January 9 meeting with congressional Democratic leaders, no further negotiations were conducted.Several Republican senators met in the office of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, after the meeting to discuss a compromise to end the shutdown.They discussed agreeing to Trump\'s demand for border wall funding and offering the Democrats help for Dreamers, refugee protections and extensions to H-2B visas.On January 13, Graham proposed that Trump agree to a congressional vote to reopen the government pending the resumption of negotiations.Graham suggested that if Trump and congressional Democrats did not come to an agreement at that time, Trump could declare a national emergency.Trump rejected this proposal the next day.\n\nOn January 19, Trump proposed a temporary extension of the two programs that protect about 700,000 immigrants from deportation—Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)—in exchange for funding for the border wall.The protections would be temporary, with no path to citizenship.Trump had previously revoked TPS for people from a number of Latin American and African countries, and taken steps to rescind DACA.In his remarks at the White House, Trump referred to a ""barrier"" rather than a ""wall"" and indicated that he aimed to erect ""steel barriers in high priority locations"" rather than ""a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea.""\n\nIn addition to funding a border wall, the 1,300-page Republican bill released after Trump made his proposal would make major changes to U.S. immigration policy (which were not included in Trump\'s public announcement).The legislation would severely restrict the ability of children from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to apply for asylum in the United States.Specifically, participation in the Central American Minors Program would be subject to an annual cap and migrant children would be barred from applying for asylum in person at the border, and only migrant children with a ""qualified"" parent in the U.S. would be eligible to apply.The bill would also create a new, more burdensome application process for TPS holders, and would exclude TPS holders from Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen.The American Immigration Lawyers Association government relations director said that the proposal ""would categorically block tens of thousands of children from ever applying for asylum,"" while a Cato Institute immigration analyst wrote that the proposal would not extend DACA, but rather replace it with ""a totally different program that will exclude untold thousands of Dreamers who would have been eligible under DACA.""\n\nDemocrats rejected Trump\'s proposal.In a speech on the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""The president\'s proposal is one-sided, harshly partisan and was made in bad faith.The asylum changes are a poison pill, if there ever was one.""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said extending the DACA proposal temporarily was ""unacceptable"" and a ""non-starter"" because it did not ""represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people\'s lives.""Analysts pointed out that Trump had previously rejected a deal that would have provided funding for the border wall in exchange for further protection for DACA recipients.Conversely, Republicans reacted positively to Trump\'s proposal, and Mitch McConnell said he would bring it to a vote in the Senate.\n\nDuring the shutdown, on January 8 in a press conference, a reporter asked Trump if he was considering declaring a national emergency, to which Trump replied, ""I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want"" and suggested that he could declare an emergency.After this, Trump repeatedly threatened to declare a national emergency to unilaterally order wall construction without congressional authorization.Some of Trump\'s advisors, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, reportedly attempted to dissuade him from doing so.Administration officials considered diverting hurricane-relief and wildfire-relief funds from a $13.9 billion February 2018 emergency supplemental appropriations bill (for disaster relief in Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California, among other places) in order to fund a wall, and directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to look into this possibility.\n\nAn attempt by Trump to invoke emergency powers would almost certainly have prompted a lengthy legal challenge in court.Democrats responded that Trump lacked the authority to declare a national emergency; Representative Adam Schiff called it a ""non-starter"" and said that ""if Harry Truman couldn\'t nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this President doesn\'t have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion dollar wall on the border.""Democratic Representative Nydia Velázquez said the notion of redirecting disaster-relief funds to a border wall was ""beyond appalling"".Presidents have declared emergencies in the past, but none has ""involved funding a policy goal after failing to win congressional approval"".Yale Law School professor Bruce Ackerman wrote that the declaration of a national emergency to build a wall as Trump suggested would be unconstitutional and illegal.Other scholars, such as Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice, believed that Trump could make a colorable argument that diverting military-construction appropriations for border-wall construction was legal, but that doing so would be an abuse of power.Law professor Ilya Somin stated that in the unlikely case that Trump succeeded in using the emergency powers in this way, it would set a dangerous precedent, which Republicans would come to regret next time the president was a Democrat.\n\nOn January 11, Trump—while maintaining he has the authority to do so anytime—said he was not in any rush to declare a national emergency to secure wall funding, saying he would rather see Congress ""do its job"" and that the Democrats ""should come back and vote.""The next day he again threatened to use emergency powers if Democrats did not ""come to their senses.""\n\nOn January 16, Pelosi sent a letter to Trump that indicated the House would be unavailable for the 2019 State of the Union Address that was scheduled for January 29.Pelosi wrote, ""Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government reopens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has reopened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on Jan. 29.""The delivery of the State of the Union address had been delayed or substantially changed on only two occasions since 1913.In a letter sent to the Speaker the next day, Trump said she would not be allowed to take military transport aircraft on scheduled visits to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan.Trump replied, ""We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the shutdown is over.""Pelosi and a congressional delegation had planned on visiting overseas American military personnel.\n\nOn January 23, Trump sent a letter to Pelosi insisting that there were no security concerns and that he would hold the State of the Union Address as scheduled.Trump wrote, ""Therefore, I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and Congress of the United States of America regarding the State of our Union.""In a letter sent in reply, Pelosi stated that the House would not consider a concurrent resolution to authorize the State of the Union Address in the House Chamber until the shutdown ended, writing, ""Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened.""\n\nTrump later stated he would look for an alternative, but then retracted that statement in a pair of tweets announcing that he would wait until the end of the shutdown to give the address in the House Chamber.\n\nOn January 25, Trump announced his support for a three-week funding measure that would reopen the government until February 15.The deal, which also moved forward with long-term Department of Homeland Security funding, did not include funds for a wall.As expected, the agreement provided federal employees with back pay.Both the Senate and House of Representatives passed the funding measure by voice vote, sending the resolution to the President\'s desk.Trump signed the bill the same day, ending the shutdown.\n\nLater in January, Republican senators voted unanimously against a bill to provide back pay to federal contractors.\n\nWithout legislation enacted by February 15, a new partial shutdown would have begun, three weeks after the last ended.A bipartisan group of senators and representatives reached an agreement ""in principle"" on February 11, but Trump did not say whether he would sign it.Included was $1.375 billion for 55 miles of steel border fencing.On February 13, it was reported that, against the wishes of Democratic leaders and many Republicans, Trump was blocking the provision of back pay to federal contractors who were still out of pocket from the shutdown.Both houses passed the bill February 14 with enough votes to override a veto if that happened.\n\nOn February 15, at the White House Rose Garden, Trump announced that he had signed the spending bill to keep the government open.He also declared a national emergency, hoping to get access to $8 billion to use for border security.\n\nAgencies funded by two ""minibus"" appropriations bills passed in September 2018 were not affected by the shutdown.About 380,000 federal employees were furloughed, and an additional 420,000 employees for the affected agencies were expected to work with their pay delayed until the end of the shutdown, totaling 800,000 workers affected out of 2.1 million civilian non-postal federal employees.As only about a quarter of the government was shut down, many people who are not federal employees did not fully realize the effects of the shutdown.\n\nAccording to and , these were the affected agencies:\n\nDepartment of State Department of the Treasury Department of Justice Most of the Department of the Interior Department of Agriculture Department of Commerce Department of Housing and Urban Development Department of Transportation Department of Homeland Security Some Department of Health and Human Services agencies Food and Drug Administration Indian Health Service Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Superfund Research Program Executive Office of the President Most independent agencies Judicial Branch\n\nUnaffected agencies include, according to and :\n\nDepartment of Defense Department of Labor Most of the Department of Health and Human Services Department of Energy Department of Education Department of Veterans Affairs Some Department of the Interior agencies Bureau of Reclamation Central Utah Project District of Columbia (excluding courts) Legislative Branch Social Security Administration Nuclear Regulatory Commission Appalachian Regional Commission Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board Delta Regional Authority Denali Commission Northern Border Regional Commission Southeast Crescent Regional Commission Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board American Battle Monuments Commission U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Cemeterial Expenses of the Army, including Arlington National Cemetery and Soldiers\' and Airmen\'s Home National Cemetery Armed Forces Retirement Home Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System Fund Intelligence Community Management Account Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled Corporation for National and Community Service Corporation for Public Broadcasting Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission Institute of Museum and Library Services Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission Medicare Payment Advisory Commission National Council on Disability National Labor Relations Board National Mediation Board Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission Railroad Retirement Board\n\nJobs affected included staff throughout the United States, not just DC area employees.FBI agents, federal corrections officers, FDA inspectors, NASA employees, TSA staff, Border Patrol staff and CBP officers, census staff, National Park Service staff, members of the Coast Guard, and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers either worked without pay or were furloughed, with increasing numbers of unpaid essential employees failing to show up for work.\n\nOn January 11, 800,000 workers for agencies shutdown or furloughed missed their first paycheck.Federal workers normally receive pay on federal holidays, which include Christmas, New Year\'s Day and potentially Martin Luther King Jr. Day.The shutdown affected the employees\' entitlement to paid holidays due to the shutdown.Unemployment assistance to federal workers furloughed under the government shutdown varied by locality.Only non-reporting workers were eligible for assistance, whereas furloughed workers who still reported to work were not.Workers who received unemployment assistance were required pay it back after the shut down ended and they received backpay.Some furloughed workers sought other employment opportunities while they were idled.However, external employment must meet agency-specific ethics guidelines, and mandatory reviews of external employment were also curtailed as most ethics officials were also furloughed.Federal employees were not able to use vacation or sick leave during the shutdown so scheduled holiday vacation time either became unpaid if the worker was deemed non-essential or was cancelled if the worker was deemed essential.In many cases unused leave over a certain threshold expired at year-end, but employees who had leave scheduled in advance of the shutdown did not have ""use or lose"" leave balances deducted from their accrued leave.Many furloughed employees took to crowd-funding campaigns to raise cash to replace missed paychecks, but these types of solicitations also run afoul of government ethics rules.\n\nAs furloughed federal workers and their families shared stories of their hardships, such as not being able to meet rent or mortgage payments and missed bills, the hashtag ""#ShutdownStories"" went viral on social media.The federal government\'s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) responded by publishing sample letters that employees could send to their creditors.One read, in part, ""I am a Federal employee who has recently been furloughed due to a lack of funding of my agency.Because of this, my income has been severely cut and I am unable to pay the entire cost of my mortgage, along with my other expenses.""Other federal workers reached out to other news outlets to share stories about having to stretch their budgets and the impact of the shutdown on their families.In addition to being unable to meet rent or pay bills, many federal workers around the country were unable to pay for groceries and turned to food banks.One federal prison guard in Louisiana attempted suicide after posting about the financial pressures of the shutdown on Facebook.\n\nThe OPM also suggested that employees who had landlords write: ""I would like to discuss with you the possibility of trading my services to perform maintenance (e.g. painting, carpentry work) in exchange for partial rent payments"" and suggested those who lacked funds to pay bills should hire personal attorneys to assist them.Other organizations also posted advice on how to ""find supplemental income""; the Coast Guard suggested that Coast Guard members ""have a garage sale, offer to watch children, walk pets or house sit"" while furloughed.\n\nOn January 4, The Washington Post reported that because the shutdown was triggered by the failure to enact spending bills that continued a federal government pay freeze, hundreds of senior Trump administration political appointees would receive a roughly $10,000 pay raise the following day.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the pending pay raise was an ""unnecessary byproduct of the shutdown.""\n\nOn January 10, the Senate approved by unanimous consent a bill (S.24, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019) providing that furloughed federal employees would receive back pay for the period of the furlough once appropriations were restored; the bill was approved the next day by the House on a vote of 411–7.Trump signed the bill into law on January 16.\n\nNative American tribes were not paid for treaties negotiated with the United States government.These treaties specified that the federal government must provide funding for health clinics, employee salaries, education, infrastructure and other services, which were not paid during the shutdown.Native lands are ""owned, managed and maintained by the federal government.""Native Americans who receive a per capita check for profits from oil and gas sales from tribal land did not receive check for the month of February.Roads were not plowed on tribal land, and some areas received significant snowfall.This caused people of the Navajo Nation to become trapped inside their homes.Food services, which fed 90,000 Native Americans in 2017, were halted.\n\nNative American communities had a high percentage of individuals who worked for the federal government and lost income during the shutdown.In North and South Dakota, one of the largest employers is the Indian Health Service.The Chippewa tribe reported an economic loss of nearly $100,000 daily in funds that the federal government was supposed to provide as a treaty obligation.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was closed for the shutdown.However, 60 percent of the Indian Health Service (IHS) continued to work without pay.IHS provides care for 2.2 million Native Americans and on January 23, began to deny care that was not considered ""life threatening.""The Bureau of Indian Education was able to stay open because it was funded on a different schedule.Unlike other government shutdowns, there was little outreach from the Trump Administration to Native Americans and the Chippewa tribe in Michigan was given a 24-hour notice that the shutdown would take place and affect the tribe.\n\nThe only military branch that was affected by the shutdown was the Coast Guard because it was part of the Department of Homeland Security, while the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps were all funded through the Department of Defense.Officials were able to fund payment on December 31, 2018, but were not able to do so for the paychecks of January 15 and 30, 2019, along with the pay and benefits for civilian workers and retirees.During the shutdown, the Coast Guard continued to engage in patrolling the American coastline and carrying out overseas missions in locations such as the Persian Gulf along with the Navy and in the Caribbean.Other issues arose in the payment processes for Coast Guard members Tricare Health and Dental Program payments, although the individuals were still covered.\n\nMilitary schools, such as the Coast Guard Academy and the National War College, lost funding due to the shutdown and the schools had to work to find funds to pay professors.\n\nAlthough the Department of Defense was not shut down, the February 4, 2019, date for release of the Pentagon\'s 2020 budget was delayed by at least one month.This had repercussions on the interim period which is usually used by Pentagon planners for adjustments before the 2020 fiscal year which will begin in October 2019.The White House Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the Pentagon request, was shut down when the Pentagon budget arrived in December, and remained inactive, so no work was done on the budget.\n\nOn February 25, 2019, the Pentagon\'s counter-drug (interdiction) funding has up to $85 million not yet obligated, but that money was planned for the known corridors in El Paso, Tucson, Yuma, and El Centro for border fencing, lighting, and road projects, so any funds which might possibly be intended for additional projects elsewhere along the border must be obligated by September 30, 2019, in order not to affect the known corridors.Otherwise appropriations above the $85 million not yet obligated for additional interdiction border projects will have to be approved by additional Congressional appropriations, to reach the $2 billion target.\n\nA January 28, 2019 Congressional Budget Office report estimated that the 35-day partial government shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion, including $3 billion in permanent losses; the CBO estimate excluded indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.The furloughing of 145,000 federal workers and 112,500 federal contractors in the Washington Metropolitan Area cost the regional economy $119 million each day, or 7.3% of the region\'s total output.That reduced GDP by over $2.8 billion in the Washington DC area alone.The shutdown also had a noticeable impact on hunger in the national capital region: food pantries in Washington DC and Northern Virginia reported an increase of around 10% in the number of people coming to pick up groceries, with most of that increase coming from federal workers and contractors.\n\nFitch Ratings warned that an extended shutdown might lead to a downgrade in the U.S.\'s Triple-A credit rating if lawmakers were unable to pass a budget or manage the debt ceiling.That in turn would make borrowing more costly for companies and American households, because it is the benchmark for many other lines of credit.The only time the U.S. credit rating has been downgraded by S&P was during the United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011.\n\nSome economists believed that an extended shutdown would weaken consumer confidence and heighten the risk of pushing the U.S. economy into a recession.Between 800,000 federal government employees and some 4 million federal contractors, the shutdown directly affected nearly 3% of the labor force of the United States; in a typical recession, unemployment increases 2–4%.The reduction in spending by those households combined with the reduction of government services could have macroeconomic results similar to a typical recession.The shutdown had an adverse effect on the budgets of state and local governments, as states covered some federal services (particularly the most vulnerable) during the shutdown.\n\nBy mid-January 2019, the White House Council of Economic Advisors estimated that each week of the shutdown reduced GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, the equivalent of 1.2 points per quarter.CEA chairman Kevin Hassett later acknowledged that GDP growth could decline to zero in the first quarter of 2019 if the shutdown lasted the entire quarter.\n\nAs tax season began in the United States on January 28, some 46,000 Internal Revenue Service workers were called back to work to ensure tax refunds and returns were not affected by the shutdown.The recalled workers allowed the department to continue operations that were automatic and those deemed necessary for the safety of human life or protection of government property, such as processing electronic returns, returns with payments, mailing tax forms, appeals, criminal law enforcement investigations and technical support.\n\nDuring the shutdown, 95% of federal staff for the USDA\'s Food and Nutrition Services were furloughed.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the food-stamp program, could be funded through a $3 billion contingency fund appropriated by Congress in 2018; if the shutdown had continued through March 2019, those funds would have been exhausted, leaving some 38 million Americans without food stamps and endangering food security.Concerns were raised that continuation of the shutdown could delay the issuance of some $140 billion in tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees most of the food supply in the U.S.In early January, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner, reported that the FDA suspended food inspections.He noted that inspection of foreign food was continuing as ""almost normal,"" because they are considered vital.Around January 14, ""high-risk"" food inspections resumed.As of January 22, 2019, 46 percent of the FDA were working, though 20 percent of them were working without pay.During the shutdown, two new recalls for contamination with Listeria or Salmonella took place.Consumer advocacy groups advised of food safety issues during the shutdown.Food safety attorney, Bill Marler, advocated against eating ""fresh, uncooked products on the market place.""Because there was a shortage of FDA inspectors, many imported perishable items, such as produce or flowers, were at risk of spoilage.Meat and some egg products are inspected by the USDA\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service.Federal legislation required those inspectors to remain working without pay.\n\nSchool administrations raised concern about how to feed children who purchase food at the schools for lunch, as funding concerns caused some districts to conserve food and funding.Many limited the amount or variation of foods available for the children to purchase, and alerted parents to the concerns and the limited availability of some of the items.Most schools affected were in high-poverty areas, and depended on federally funded lunch programs, such as the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) a federal grant established by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 and operated through the Department of Agriculture.Some 22 million students in nearly 100,000 schools received school meals through that operation.\n\nAs with the January 2018 shutdown, national parks were expected to be open to the extent practical, though there would be no staff and buildings would be closed.The shutdown affected national parks unevenly, some were accessible with bare-bones staffing levels, some operated with money from states or charitable groups, and others were locked off.Diane Regas, president and chief executive of the Trust for Public Land, called upon Trump to close all national parks to protect the public: by the third week of the shutdown, three people had died in national parks.This number was reported as being within \'usual\' levels.At Yosemite National Park, on January 4, 2019, a death from a fall went unreported for a week.\n\nBy January 1, 2019, the problems of neglected trash pileup, overflowing public toilets, and access to first aid were repeated across the Park system.Health and safety concerns were raised, with concerns by scientists that the expansive amount of garbage and human waste could impact water and soil quality, or cause damage to animals in the parks.Other issues that arose due to the shutdown included illegal campsites, protected agriculture being damaged, damaging of government property and trespassing on foot and by vehicle.\n\nNew York kept the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open, as it did during the January 2018 shutdown.Arizona and Utah were able to keep Grand Canyon National Park, Zion National Park, Arches National Park, and Bryce Canyon National Park open and provided services including public restrooms, shuttles and trash collection.Utah\'s funding included visitor centers.The sites closed outright in the southwest alone included Bandelier National Monument and Valles Caldera National Preserve in northern New Mexico, White Sands National Monument in southern New Mexico, Petrified Forest National Park in northern Arizona and Casa Grande Ruins National Monument in south-central Arizona.Access to major parts of Sequoia and Kings Canyon parks were closed, and at Joshua Tree National Park, the administration policy of leaving parks open to visitors despite the staff furloughs resulted in park damage, including the toppling of protected trees.In Texas, Big Bend National Park had no visitor services, such as restrooms.Some trailheads were closed.Regulations continued to be enforced, as the park remained open.Visitors were reminded to remove their own trash and toilet paper.The Alamo remained open but no NPS services were available at the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park.Channel Islands National Park remained open to public access, although services normally provided by the national park service were instead provided by Island Packers Cruises, the company normally in charge of ferries to the islands.\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration closed immediately on December 22, 2018.The Library of Congress, the U.S. Botanic Garden, the Capitol Visitor Center, and the U.S. Capitol Building remained open as they were funded by the 2019 Legislative Branch appropriations bill.The Smithsonian Institution operated on ""prior-year funds"" through January 1, 2019.On January 2, 2019, the Smithsonian Institution initiated an orderly shutdown of all its facilities, including 19 museums in Washington, D.C., and New York City, the National Zoo, and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.The following day, the National Gallery of Art was closed.The National Zoo also closed on January 3, 2019.Tourism attendance on the National Mall was affected.On January 5, 2019, acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt directed the diversion of fee revenue defined by the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to be used to fund minimal maintenance activities so as to preserve access to highly visited parks.\n\nAccording to a January 12, 2019, article in The Economist, on January 11, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was unable to pay its workers who had not been paid since December 22; 55% more of them called in sick than in January 2018.\n\nAs the air traffic controllers were deemed essential employees, they were required to work without pay.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents air traffic controllers, filed a lawsuit against the federal government for the shutdown on January 11, 2019, claiming that requiring 16,000 air traffic controllers to work without being paid violated their constitutional rights and federal minimum wage law.That was the third lawsuit filed against the federal government since the beginning of the shutdown.\n\nAirline and aircraft safety inspectors, on the other hand, were deemed nonessential and furloughed.A news report on January 12, 2019, stated that the Federal Aviation Administration had returned 500 furloughed safety inspectors back to work and would return more to work in the following weeks.As the airline and aircraft safety inspectors were furloughed, the certification process of the Airbus A220 in the US was stalled.Delta Air Lines was forced to delay the launch of the new aircraft, and to use other models of aircraft to serve those routes that was supposed to be served with A220.Many TSA employees also called out sick, most of them because they were trying to find other jobs that would provide immediate paychecks.\n\nThe shutdown initially prevented the National Transportation Safety Board from assisting the Mexican government\'s investigation of the 2018 Puebla helicopter crash that killed a state governor and senator; an exception allowed the NTSB to assist with the Mexican government in the investigation along with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.The NTSB also had to delay several investigations until the government reopened and only continued investigations into accidents that were considered the most serious.Issues in receiving certification and oversight from the FAA led to a month-long delay in the commencement of passenger service at Paine Field in Everett, Washington.\n\nAs the shutdown continued into its fourth week, the unions representing airline pilots, flight attendants and air traffic controllers issued a statement asserting, ""we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play"" because of the shutdown.\n\nSome airports such as the Philadelphia International Airport, launched food and item donations for federal employees who were affected by the shutdown.Other airports such as the Miami International Airport, and the George Bush International Airport, closed down terminals in order to spread out the TSA workers that were available.\n\nOn January 25, flights destined for LaGuardia Airport in New York were halted to a groundstop by FAA officials due to staffing shortages directly as a result of the shutdown.As a result, several flights to and from neighboring airports in the Northeast, specifically Philadelphia and Newark, suffered significant delays of their own.Soon after that, appropriations passed and the government reopened.\n\nThe shutdown delayed software updates to the Boeing 737 MAX airplane which may have caused the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.\n\nDuring the shutdown, court-appointed private lawyers who represent indigent defendants worked without pay.The Federal Judiciary initially had a goal of sustaining paid operations through January 18, 2019.It said it would run out of money to sustain court operations no earlier than January 25, but perhaps as late as February 1.Failing funding, the Judiciary would operate under the terms of the Antideficiency Act.This Act does not allow federal agencies to expend federal funds before an appropriation, nor to accept any voluntary services.The judiciary had 33,000 employees nationwide.Under the Constitution, Supreme Court Justices, appeals court judges and district judges would continue to be paid.\n\nThe shutdown caused many delays and disruptions in cases.Budgets were watched carefully to be able to pay public defenders, DNA testing, informants, and travel costs to interview victims and witnesses.Staffing issues also brought about concerns and constraints with prisons lacking the staff to safely hold attorney-client visits, and caused a delay in bail hearings.\n\nAgents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed in a report released on January 22, 2019, by the FBI Agents Association, that several different investigations were compromised by the shutdown.The report was called ""Voices from the Field"" and was 72 pages long.FBI agents were unable to pay Confidential Human Sources which risks losing that informant permanently.Some FBI divisions no longer have Spanish-speaking staff on hand and could not work with informants who only speak Spanish.Some agents reported that they did not have the funds to assist in joint operations with local law enforcement.\n\nFederal law enforcement agencies working on Native American land worked without pay through the shutdown.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was forced to cancel a trip to the United States/Mexico border in early January due to the shutdown.DHS was also unable to inspect Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities during the shutdown to ensure that immigrants were being held in facilities appropriately.During the shutdown, the federal government\'s e-Verify system—a system for employers to check the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States—was halted.\n\nDuring the shutdown, a wave of Domain Name System (DNS) attacks on government sites was detected by Homeland Security.The attacks were serious because these Internet sites could be hijacked.\n\nOfficial websites for agencies were rendered insecure or inaccessible through the shutdown, as the expired digital certificates were not renewed.On January 23, DHS asked all government agencies to secure their DNS records; however, many agencies were not able to respond quickly to this request.\n\nExecutive and legislative affairs of the local government of the District of Columbia continued operating through the shutdown, due to a provision previously enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017.The District\'s local court system, including the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, are part of the federal judiciary.Thus, they were partially shut down, preventing District residents from accessing services such as marriage licensing.The District of Columbia government said it would take over trash collection and snow plowing operations for National Park Service facilities in Washington.\n\nThe shutdown also interfered with the response to the 2018 Sunda Strait tsunami, as the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta\'s Twitter account was unable to tweet updates, and the United States Geological Survey was unable to provide data on the tsunami.The American weather model, the GFS, suffered a significant drop in forecast quality when a data format change during the shutdown prevented certain weather data from being recognized by the GFS, and the shutdown prevented the bug from being corrected.\n\nBy mid-day Thursday, January 3, 2019, the FCC had suspended operations.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai canceled his trip to the Consumer Electronics Show.The FTC also suspended certain online operations.The EPA and Department of Energy\'s Energy Star website was not available for the duration of the shutdown.\n\nMakers of alcoholic beverages were unable to receive approval from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau for new labels and recipes during the shutdown.\n\nBased on the recalculation of their operating reserves, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) would have had to cease patent operations in the second week of February.A cadre of personnel was allocated to continue receiving patent applications, receive payments, and maintain the IT infrastructure.Even though the USPTO is self-funded, a Congressional appropriation is required to permit the USPTO to spend money.The pipeline of patent applications at the time took 15.8 months for a response from an examiner.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution shortened to two days and downscaled its scheduled ten-day 2019 Folklife Festival on the National Mall because of the shutdown\'s effects.Sabrina Motley, the director of the festival, said that initially, crucial funding for the June—July event arrived later than expected, slowing preparations.Motley stated: ""The government opened back up, but it took a while for systems to come back online. ...We looked at our production schedule, and it became clear we would need more time than we had.""\n\nThe White House residence staff who stage public receptions were among those furloughed, with a minimal staff continuing to work unpaid for the first family.In the midst of the shutdown Trump invited the Clemson Tigers football team to a White House dinner reception on January 14 in recognition of their College Football Playoff National Championship win.On the morning of the reception Trump announced that he intended to serve fast food hamburgers and pizza to the team, a remark that some commentators interpreted as a joke.That evening Trump welcomed the team in the State Dining Room with a buffet of fast food and pizza from McDonald\'s, Wendy\'s and other restaurant chains, which he stated that he had paid for personally.Trump served fast food to other visiting athletes later that year, after the shutdown had ended.\n\nOn January 10, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with several other unions, announced plans to protest the government shutdown at 1:00pm EST in Washington, DC.Leaders of the National Federation of Federal Employees stated they had hoped that bringing federal workers to the President\'s doorstep would show him that it was the individual workers that the shutdown was hurting the most.President Trump had left to visit the US–Mexican border in Texas earlier in the day.\n\nSimilar protests took place in Philadelphia and St. Louis, among other cities.On January 15, representatives for Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, and Vietnam Veterans of America along with others called for an end to shutdown, but avoided placing any blame on political parties.\n\nShortly after the protests, the American Federation of Government Employees sued the Trump administration to challenge the arrangements for work without pay during the shutdown.A similar suit was raised and won during the 2013 Federal Government shutdown.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association also sued the Trump administration, as the shutdown allegedly violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by failing to pay the workers at least a minimum wage during the shutdown.\n\nAs the salaries for members of Congress are written into permanent law and not funded through annual appropriations, the government shutdown did not affect their salaries.Senators and Representatives were still paid their biweekly salaries of $6,700 towards at least $174,000 a year.\n\nSeveral Democratic and Republican Senators and Representatives said they would donate or refuse their salary during the shutdown.Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw stated that he would refuse his salary, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto indicated she would donate hers to a Nevada charity, Senator Mazie Hirono said she would donate her salary to Hawaii food banks, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would give hers to refugee non-profit HIAS, New York Congressman Max Rose stated that he would give his salary to charity and outgoing Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota pledged hers to charity, along with her Republican colleague John Hoeven.Republican senator Kevin Cramer, who defeated Heidi Heitkamp in the 2018 midterm elections, refused to donate his salary, calling the move ""gimmicky"".Representative Brian Fitzpatrick urged all members of Congress to decline their paychecks.He said, ""If you\'re in Congress, don\'t just delay your pay -- forfeit it, write a check back to the US Treasury.Then you\'ll feel the pain of federal workers.""\n\nBy January 17, 2019, 102 members of Congress—20 Senators and 82 Representatives— chose to decline their paychecks or were donating their paychecks to charity.\n\nDuring the shutdown, many federal workers used food banks and food pantries in order to feed themselves and their families.Many food pantries waived certain restrictions in order to help government workers have access to food.During the shutdown, the Salvation Army Emergency Disasters Services program provided meals for federal workers.Chef Jose Andres created the #ChefsForFeds program to feed federal workers in Washington, D.C. and by January 21, made announcements to expand the program nationwide.\n\nSome states such as California, offered furloughed employees unemployment benefits, although the Trump administration allegedly told states that they could not do so with federal funds.Organizations such as state Attorney Generals offices, and credit card companies posted statements to their websites to offer a means to help to consolidate debt, meet mortgages or other payments such as child support or tuition.An employment law firm offered pro bono legal advice to furloughed federal employees.School districts opened up free or reduced lunch options for children of federal employees, and looked into other options to aid parents amid concerns that financial stress at home would adversely affect families and children.Every mainline denomination in America has contributed to efforts to provide relief.One Baptist church emptied its entire disaster fund to aid federal employees.\n\nOn January 24, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross downplayed the financial difficulties faced by the 800,000 federal workers affected by the shutdown, stating that they should borrow money to ""tide them over"" until the shutdown ends.Critics and Democrats criticized the statement as inappropriate, noting that Ross\' own net worth is estimated at almost $700 million, accusing him of being out of touch with the workers.Ross also said that he ""did not understand"" why people who were not getting paid due to the shutdown were visiting food banks.When asked about Ross\' statement, Trump suggested that grocery stores will ""work along"" with the government by voluntarily extending credit to those who are out of funds to buy food.National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow characterized the shutdown as a ""glitch"" and suggested that federal workers who were required to work without pay were ""volunteering"" to work for their love of the country and ""presumably their allegiance to President Trump.""\n\nIn a video message to staff, FBI director Christopher Wray stated, ""Making some people stay home when they don\'t want to, and making others show up without pay, it\'s mind-boggling, it\'s shortsighted and it\'s unfair.It takes a lot to get me angry, but I\'m about as angry as I\'ve been in a long, long time.""\n\nLara Trump, a daughter-in-law of the President, drew outrage after an interview in which she stated that while ""It\'s not fair to you..."" the shutdown was ""...a little bit of pain, but it\'s going to be for the future of our country, and their children and their grandchildren and generations after them will thank them for their sacrifice right now.""Her comments drew criticism by politicians, celebrities, and the general public who felt the advisor and spokeswoman for the Trump 2020 campaign was out of touch, however Lara Trump later claimed the comments were taken out of context.\n\nIn January 2019, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that 56% of the responding public opposed a wall while 39% favored it, and 45% viewed the situation at the border as a crisis.The numbers were similar to the poll in December 2018 yet a later poll by ABC News showed that as the partial shutdown entered its fourth week support for building a wall was increasing.A poll done through YouGov between December 23–25, 2018, reported that 51% of respondents thought Trump deserved ""a lot"" of the blame, 44% thought congressional Democrats and 39% thought congressional Republicans.Similar results were reported by a December 21–25 survey done by Reuters and Ipsos in which 47% of respondents said that the shutdown was the President\'s fault and 33% blamed Congressional Democrats.\n\nOver the course of the shutdown, Trump\'s approval rating marginally declined while his disapproval rating marginally increased.His net approval rating was by the middle of January 2019 at its lowest point since February 2018.On December 27, 2018, it was reported that Trump\'s approval rating of registered voters was at 39%, with 56% disapproval.Broken down the rating was split across party lines, with Republicans reporting an 80% approval rate while Democrats and independents reported a 90% and 57% disapproval rating, respectively.The poll was conducted through Morning Consult between December 21–23.The poll also reported that 43% of respondents blamed Trump for the shutdown, with 31% blaming congressional Democrats and 7% congressional Republicans.Another poll through The New York Times Upshot/Siena College reported that 89% of voters\' views on Trump and the wall were aligned, suggesting that support for the wall was a function of support for Trump.\n\nThe Washington Post–ABC News poll published on January 13, 2019, found that a larger number of Americans blamed Trump and congressional Republicans than congressional Democrats for the shutdown.A PBS NewsHour–Marist poll found that on January 15, 2019, a majority of Americans thought that President Trump was to blame for the shutdown.A January 2019 poll conducted by telephone for CBS News found that 70% of Americans polled did not want a government shutdown over the issue of building a border wall; 66% believed that Trump should agree to a budget without wall funding.\n\nPresidency of Donald Trump Donald Trump January 2018 United

43,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018–2019 United States federal government shutdown', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The United States federal government shutdown from midnight EST on December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019 (35 days) was the longest government shutdown in history and the second and final federal government shutdown involving furloughs during the presidency of Donald Trump.It occurred when the 115th Congress and Trump could not agree on an appropriations bill to fund the operations of the federal government for the 2019 fiscal year, or a temporary continuing resolution that would extend the deadline for passing a bill.The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal departments or agencies from conducting non-essential operations without appropriations legislation in place.As a result, nine executive departments with around 800,000 employees had to shut down partially or in full, affecting about one-fourth of government activities and causing employees to be furloughed or required to work without being paid.The Congressional Budget Office estimated the shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion USD, excluding indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.\n\nThe shutdown stemmed from an impasse over Trump\'s demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall.In December 2018, the Senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the bill appeared likely to be approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Trump.After Trump faced heavy criticism from some right-wing media outlets and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to ""build the wall"", he announced that he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund its construction.As a result, the House passed a stopgap bill with funding for the wall, but it was blocked in the Senate by the threat of a Democratic filibuster.\n\nIn January 2019, representatives elected in the November 2018 election took office, giving the Democrats a majority in the House.The House immediately voted to approve the appropriations bill that had previously passed the Senate unanimously (which included no funding for the wall).For several weeks, Trump continued to maintain that he would veto any bill that did not fund an entire border wall, and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the Senate from considering any appropriations legislation that Trump would not support, including the bill that had previously passed.Democrats and some Republicans opposed the shutdown and passed multiple bills to reopen the government, arguing that the government shutdown amounted to ""hostage-taking"" civil servants and that negotiations could only begin once the government was reopened.\n\nOn January 25, 2019, Trump agreed to endorse a stopgap bill to reopen the government for three weeks up until February 15 to allow for negotiations to take place to approve an appropriations bill that both parties could agree on.However, Trump reiterated his demand for the border wall funding and said that he would shut down the government again or declare a national emergency and use military funding to build the wall if Congress did not appropriate the funds by February 15.\n\nTrump\'s approval rating dropped during the shutdown.A majority of Americans opposed exploitation of the shutdown as a negotiating strategy and held Trump responsible for the shutdown: A CBS News poll found that 71% of Americans considered the border wall ""not worth the shutdown"" and a Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 53% of Americans blamed Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, compared to 34% who blamed Democrats and 10% who blamed both parties.\n\nOn February 15, 2019, Trump declared a national emergency to fund the wall and bypass Congress, after being unsatisfied with a bipartisan border bill that had passed the House and the Senate a day before.\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign, then-candidate Trump promised to build a wall along the Mexico–United States border for which Mexico would pay.The president of Mexico rejected the idea of providing any funding for a U.S. border wall.In 2018, Trump requested $ in federal funding for some of barrier on the border, mostly to replace of aging fence built under the Secure Fence Act of 2006.On December 25, 2018, Trump reversed course, suggesting that he might accept of either mostly refurbished barrier (rather than new barriers in locations that did not previously have them) by November 2020.Trump\'s proposals and public statements on the wall have shifted widely over time, with varied proposals as to the design, material, length, height, and width of a wall.\n\nIn September 2018, Congress passed two ""minibus"" appropriations bills for the 2019 United States federal budget, which began on October 1, 2018.These bills combined five of the 12 regular appropriations bills covering 77% of federal discretionary funding, and included a continuing resolution until December 7 for the remaining agencies.On December 6, Congress passed a second continuing resolution to December 21, to give more time for negotiations on Trump\'s proposed border wall, which had been delayed due to the funeral of George H. W. Bush.\n\nA Senate Homeland Security appropriations bill, negotiated by both parties and reported by the committee to the Senate, provided for $ for border security, including funds for ""approximately 65 miles of pedestrian fencing along the southwest border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector"".The bill did not receive a vote on the Senate floor, although House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer indicated that such a proposal could be acceptable to House Democrats.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said the Democratic Party would not support $ for the border wall.At a press conference before the government shutdown, he noted ""the $1.6 billion for border security negotiated by Democrats and Republicans is our position.We believe that is the right way to go.""\n\nOn December 11, President Trump held a televised meeting with Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in the Oval Office and asked them to support an appropriation of $5.7 billion for funding of a border wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico.They refused, resulting in an argument between Trump and both Congressional leaders.During the contentious discussion, Trump remarked, ""I am proud to shut down the government for border security ...I will be the one to shut [the government] down.I\'m not going to blame you for it ...I will take the mantle.I will be the one to shut it down.""Schumer replied, ""We shouldn\'t shut down the government over a dispute.""Ten days later, Trump blamed Democrats for the impending shutdown.\n\nThree days later, Politico reported that Trump was willing to sign a bill with no funding for a border wall that delayed a government shutdown into 2019 and the new Congress.On December 18, following a meeting with Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the government would not shut down on December 22 and that Trump was ""flexible"" over funding for a border wall.Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby commented that the most likely resolution was a bill that funded the government until early February.Schumer added that his caucus would ""very seriously"" consider such a bill and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said ""I don\'t know anybody on the Hill that wants a shutdown, and I think all the president\'s advisers are telling him this would not be good.""\n\nOn December 19, the Senate passed a second continuing resolution () that would fund the government until February 8, 2019.Pelosi announced that House Democrats would support the measure, meaning it would overcome opposition from conservative Republicans and pass the House.On December 20, following increased criticism from conservative media, pundits, and political figures, Trump reversed his position and declared that he would not sign any funding bill that did not include border wall funding.The same day, the House passed a continuing resolution that included $5 billion for the wall and $8 billion in disaster aid.This bill failed in the Senate.Trump\'s changing position caused consternation among Senate Republicans.\n\nThe shutdown started December 22 and Trump announced that he would cancel his planned trip to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas and stay in Washington, D.C.The meaning of the term ""wall"" was expected to be an aspect of the negotiations.\n\nCongress adjourned on December 22 for the Christmas and holiday season, with many predicting that the shutdown would not be resolved until the start of the 116th Congress.The Senate reconvened on December 27 for four minutes, with Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) presiding over the session.The House briefly reconvened as well, with Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) saying that members should not expect any further votes for the rest of 2018.Representative Jim McGovern (D-MA) went to the House floor to try to force consideration of a short-term funding bill to end the shutdown that the Senate had already passed, but the Republican Speaker-pro-tem refused to let him speak.\n\nCongress then adjourned again until December 31, 2018, for a pro forma session.On January 2, 2019, the last full day of the 115th United States Congress, there was a pro forma session scheduled to last several minutes.\n\nThe new Congress was sworn in on January 3, 2019, and one of the first orders of business in the House after electing the Speaker and swearing in the new members was a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security until February 8 (), which passed by a vote of 239–192; and a package combining five appropriation bills funding the rest of the government for the remainder of the fiscal year (), passed by a vote of 241–190.The bills contained $1.3 billion of funding for border security, but no additional funding for a border wall.\n\nBeginning on January 9, the Democratic-controlled House voted on four appropriations bills individually:\n\nFinancial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Treasury (including the Internal Revenue Service), federal judiciary, District of Columbia, and a number of independent agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, General Services Administration, and Securities and Exchange Commission.The House passed the legislation on January 9, on a 240–188 vote, with every Democrat and eight Republicans voting yes, and all other Republicans voting no. Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Department of Agriculture (including food stamps), the Food and Drug Administration, and related entities.On January 10, the House passed this bill 243–183.Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore Transportation and Housing and Urban Development (including some federal mortgage programs).On January 10, the House passed this bill 244–180.Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Interior Department, Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies, including the Smithsonian Institution.On January 11, ten House Republicans voted with Democrats in a 240–179 vote to end the shutdown of Interior-Environment programs.It was the most recent of a ""series of standalone appropriations measures"" the House sent to the Senate.\n\nThis strategy has been compared to one used by Republicans during the 2013 shutdown in the form of a series of fourteen mini-continuing resolutions.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed that the Senate would not consider the House bills to reopen the government, indicating that Senate Republicans would not support any bill unless it had Trump\'s support.In January 2019, McConnell and Senate Republicans came under increased pressure to break the impasse and reopen the government.Three Republican Senators—Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Cory Gardner of Colorado—called for an end to the shutdown.Senators Collins and Gardner said they supported the House\'s budget bills to end the shutdown.West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito said that she could support ending the shutdown provided border wall talks continued.Pat Roberts of Kansas said that shutdowns ""never work"" and only turned affected federal workers into ""pawns"" and that, although the time had not yet come for Senate Republicans to override any possible Trump veto and end the shutdown, ""we\'re getting pretty close.""Johnny Isakson of Georgia echoed that sentiment, saying that support for McConnell\'s refusal to support bills that do not include funding for a wall would not last indefinitely: ""There\'s a time when that may run out.""\n\nOn January 16, McConnell again blocked the House appropriation bills to reopen the government from being considered on the Senate floor.The following day, McConnell blocked consideration of bills to reopen most of the closed government agencies for a third time.On January 23, McConnell blocked a bill to reopen most of the government for the fourth time.\n\nOn January 22, McConnell stated that the Senate would be voting on two different bills to end the shutdown on January 24.The first vote is on a bill to reopen the government which includes Trump\'s proposal to provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and temporary protections to some immigration classes.The other bill is a three-week continuing resolution to fund 25% of the government through February 8.\n\nOn January 22, Senator Mark Warner introduced a bill to keep the federal government running in the event of future shutdown events.The bill is called the ""Stop Shutdowns Transferring Unnecessary Pain and Inflicting Damage in the Coming Years Act"" or the ""Stop STUPIDITY Act"".\n\nOn January 24, the Senate held two votes on competing Democratic and Republican proposals to end the shutdown.The Democratic proposal was largely similar to the measure that had previously passed the Senate unanimously in the 115th Congress, and then been passed by the Democratic-controlled House in the 116th Congress.It provided funding for the government with no money for the border wall.The Republican proposal incorporated Trump\'s proposal, which would fund a border wall; temporarily extend TPS and DACA for three years, but would substantially narrow eligibility for DACA; and make significant legal changes to make it more difficult for persons escaping violence and persecution to be granted asylum in the United States.Neither proposal was able to attain the 60 votes needed for passage.The Trump plan failed in a 50–47 vote.The Democratic plan failed in a 52–44 vote.Most Republicans voted for Trump\'s plan and against the Democratic plan.Most Democrats voted for the Democratic plan and against Trump\'s plan.Republicans Tom Cotton and Mike Lee voted against both plans.Democrat Joe Manchin and Republicans Lamar Alexander, Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, Johnny Isakson, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney voted for both plans.Not voting on either were Republicans Rand Paul and Jim Risch and Democrat Jacky Rosen.Republican Richard Burr voted for Trump\'s plan and did not vote on the Democratic plan.\n\nOn January 25, House Democrats prepared a compromise proposal to reopen the government, which would provide $5 billion for border security but no wall construction.However, the shutdown ended the same day.\n\nOn January 4, after the new Congress was sworn-in and Pelosi regained the speakership, she and Schumer, as well as congressional Republican leadership met with Trump at the White House.Pelosi and Schumer argued that the shutdown needed to end and reported that Trump refused.They said that Trump threatened to ""keep the government closed for a very long period of time.Months or even years.""Later that day, Trump admitted to ""absolutely"" making that threat, adding, ""I\'m very proud of doing what I\'m doing.""Trump then said that he was considering declaring a national emergency to use military funding for the wall.At the meeting, Trump reprimanded his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney for attempting to propose a compromise between Trump\'s $5.7 billion demand for a border wall and the Democrats\' proposal of $1.3 billion for border security.\n\nTrump addressed the nation from the Oval Office at 9 p.m. EST on January 8, in a nationally televised address broadcast on both network and cable television.In his speech, Trump asserted that there was a ""growing humanitarian and security crisis"" on the Mexico–United States border that could only be solved by appropriating $5.7 billion for construction of a steel wall.Trump did not make any new proposals in his speech to break the impasse.Immediately after Trump\'s speech, Schumer and Pelosi delivered a response on behalf of the Democrats, in which they demanded an end to the shutdown and said: ""President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government.""\n\nTrump met with congressional leadership again on January 9, in a meeting lasting 14 minutes.Trump asked Pelosi, ""Will you agree to my wall?"" and when she replied that she would not, Trump said ""bye-bye"" and walked out of the meeting, later declaring it ""a total waste of time"".Schumer accused Trump of throwing a ""temper tantrum"" and slamming his hands on the table.Trump rebuked Schumer\'s comments on Twitter.Vice President Mike Pence and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that Trump remained calm and never raised his voice.On January 10, Pelosi described the preceding day\'s meeting with Trump as ""a setup"" staged by White House aides so that Trump could walk out of the meeting.Pelosi described Trump as ""un-presidential""; accused him of ""exploiting this situation in a way that enhances his power""; and said: ""I don\'t think he really wants a solution.I think he loves the distraction.""\n\nAfter Trump walked out of the January 9 meeting with congressional Democratic leaders, no further negotiations were conducted.Several Republican senators met in the office of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, after the meeting to discuss a compromise to end the shutdown.They discussed agreeing to Trump\'s demand for border wall funding and offering the Democrats help for Dreamers, refugee protections and extensions to H-2B visas.On January 13, Graham proposed that Trump agree to a congressional vote to reopen the government pending the resumption of negotiations.Graham suggested that if Trump and congressional Democrats did not come to an agreement at that time, Trump could declare a national emergency.Trump rejected this proposal the next day.\n\nOn January 19, Trump proposed a temporary extension of the two programs that protect about 700,000 immigrants from deportation—Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)—in exchange for funding for the border wall.The protections would be temporary, with no path to citizenship.Trump had previously revoked TPS for people from a number of Latin American and African countries, and taken steps to rescind DACA.In his remarks at the White House, Trump referred to a ""barrier"" rather than a ""wall"" and indicated that he aimed to erect ""steel barriers in high priority locations"" rather than ""a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea.""\n\nIn addition to funding a border wall, the 1,300-page Republican bill released after Trump made his proposal would make major changes to U.S. immigration policy (which were not included in Trump\'s public announcement).The legislation would severely restrict the ability of children from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to apply for asylum in the United States.Specifically, participation in the Central American Minors Program would be subject to an annual cap and migrant children would be barred from applying for asylum in person at the border, and only migrant children with a ""qualified"" parent in the U.S. would be eligible to apply.The bill would also create a new, more burdensome application process for TPS holders, and would exclude TPS holders from Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen.The American Immigration Lawyers Association government relations director said that the proposal ""would categorically block tens of thousands of children from ever applying for asylum,"" while a Cato Institute immigration analyst wrote that the proposal would not extend DACA, but rather replace it with ""a totally different program that will exclude untold thousands of Dreamers who would have been eligible under DACA.""\n\nDemocrats rejected Trump\'s proposal.In a speech on the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""The president\'s proposal is one-sided, harshly partisan and was made in bad faith.The asylum changes are a poison pill, if there ever was one.""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said extending the DACA proposal temporarily was ""unacceptable"" and a ""non-starter"" because it did not ""represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people\'s lives.""Analysts pointed out that Trump had previously rejected a deal that would have provided funding for the border wall in exchange for further protection for DACA recipients.Conversely, Republicans reacted positively to Trump\'s proposal, and Mitch McConnell said he would bring it to a vote in the Senate.\n\nDuring the shutdown, on January 8 in a press conference, a reporter asked Trump if he was considering declaring a national emergency, to which Trump replied, ""I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want"" and suggested that he could declare an emergency.After this, Trump repeatedly threatened to declare a national emergency to unilaterally order wall construction without congressional authorization.Some of Trump\'s advisors, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, reportedly attempted to dissuade him from doing so.Administration officials considered diverting hurricane-relief and wildfire-relief funds from a $13.9 billion February 2018 emergency supplemental appropriations bill (for disaster relief in Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California, among other places) in order to fund a wall, and directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to look into this possibility.\n\nAn attempt by Trump to invoke emergency powers would almost certainly have prompted a lengthy legal challenge in court.Democrats responded that Trump lacked the authority to declare a national emergency; Representative Adam Schiff called it a ""non-starter"" and said that ""if Harry Truman couldn\'t nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this President doesn\'t have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion dollar wall on the border.""Democratic Representative Nydia Velázquez said the notion of redirecting disaster-relief funds to a border wall was ""beyond appalling"".Presidents have declared emergencies in the past, but none has ""involved funding a policy goal after failing to win congressional approval"".Yale Law School professor Bruce Ackerman wrote that the declaration of a national emergency to build a wall as Trump suggested would be unconstitutional and illegal.Other scholars, such as Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice, believed that Trump could make a colorable argument that diverting military-construction appropriations for border-wall construction was legal, but that doing so would be an abuse of power.Law professor Ilya Somin stated that in the unlikely case that Trump succeeded in using the emergency powers in this way, it would set a dangerous precedent, which Republicans would come to regret next time the president was a Democrat.\n\nOn January 11, Trump—while maintaining he has the authority to do so anytime—said he was not in any rush to declare a national emergency to secure wall funding, saying he would rather see Congress ""do its job"" and that the Democrats ""should come back and vote.""The next day he again threatened to use emergency powers if Democrats did not ""come to their senses.""\n\nOn January 16, Pelosi sent a letter to Trump that indicated the House would be unavailable for the 2019 State of the Union Address that was scheduled for January 29.Pelosi wrote, ""Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government reopens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has reopened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on Jan. 29.""The delivery of the State of the Union address had been delayed or substantially changed on only two occasions since 1913.In a letter sent to the Speaker the next day, Trump said she would not be allowed to take military transport aircraft on scheduled visits to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan.Trump replied, ""We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the shutdown is over.""Pelosi and a congressional delegation had planned on visiting overseas American military personnel.\n\nOn January 23, Trump sent a letter to Pelosi insisting that there were no security concerns and that he would hold the State of the Union Address as scheduled.Trump wrote, ""Therefore, I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and Congress of the United States of America regarding the State of our Union.""In a letter sent in reply, Pelosi stated that the House would not consider a concurrent resolution to authorize the State of the Union Address in the House Chamber until the shutdown ended, writing, ""Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened.""\n\nTrump later stated he would look for an alternative, but then retracted that statement in a pair of tweets announcing that he would wait until the end of the shutdown to give the address in the House Chamber.\n\nOn January 25, Trump announced his support for a three-week funding measure that would reopen the government until February 15.The deal, which also moved forward with long-term Department of Homeland Security funding, did not include funds for a wall.As expected, the agreement provided federal employees with back pay.Both the Senate and House of Representatives passed the funding measure by voice vote, sending the resolution to the President\'s desk.Trump signed the bill the same day, ending the shutdown.\n\nLater in January, Republican senators voted unanimously against a bill to provide back pay to federal contractors.\n\nWithout legislation enacted by February 15, a new partial shutdown would have begun, three weeks after the last ended.A bipartisan group of senators and representatives reached an agreement ""in principle"" on February 11, but Trump did not say whether he would sign it.Included was $1.375 billion for 55 miles of steel border fencing.On February 13, it was reported that, against the wishes of Democratic leaders and many Republicans, Trump was blocking the provision of back pay to federal contractors who were still out of pocket from the shutdown.Both houses passed the bill February 14 with enough votes to override a veto if that happened.\n\nOn February 15, at the White House Rose Garden, Trump announced that he had signed the spending bill to keep the government open.He also declared a national emergency, hoping to get access to $8 billion to use for border security.\n\nAgencies funded by two ""minibus"" appropriations bills passed in September 2018 were not affected by the shutdown.About 380,000 federal employees were furloughed, and an additional 420,000 employees for the affected agencies were expected to work with their pay delayed until the end of the shutdown, totaling 800,000 workers affected out of 2.1 million civilian non-postal federal employees.As only about a quarter of the government was shut down, many people who are not federal employees did not fully realize the effects of the shutdown.\n\nAccording to and , these were the affected agencies:\n\nDepartment of State Department of the Treasury Department of Justice Most of the Department of the Interior Department of Agriculture Department of Commerce Department of Housing and Urban Development Department of Transportation Department of Homeland Security Some Department of Health and Human Services agencies Food and Drug Administration Indian Health Service Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Superfund Research Program Executive Office of the President Most independent agencies Judicial Branch\n\nUnaffected agencies include, according to and :\n\nDepartment of Defense Department of Labor Most of the Department of Health and Human Services Department of Energy Department of Education Department of Veterans Affairs Some Department of the Interior agencies Bureau of Reclamation Central Utah Project District of Columbia (excluding courts) Legislative Branch Social Security Administration Nuclear Regulatory Commission Appalachian Regional Commission Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board Delta Regional Authority Denali Commission Northern Border Regional Commission Southeast Crescent Regional Commission Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board American Battle Monuments Commission U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Cemeterial Expenses of the Army, including Arlington National Cemetery and Soldiers\' and Airmen\'s Home National Cemetery Armed Forces Retirement Home Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System Fund Intelligence Community Management Account Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled Corporation for National and Community Service Corporation for Public Broadcasting Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission Institute of Museum and Library Services Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission Medicare Payment Advisory Commission National Council on Disability National Labor Relations Board National Mediation Board Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission Railroad Retirement Board\n\nJobs affected included staff throughout the United States, not just DC area employees.FBI agents, federal corrections officers, FDA inspectors, NASA employees, TSA staff, Border Patrol staff and CBP officers, census staff, National Park Service staff, members of the Coast Guard, and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers either worked without pay or were furloughed, with increasing numbers of unpaid essential employees failing to show up for work.\n\nOn January 11, 800,000 workers for agencies shutdown or furloughed missed their first paycheck.Federal workers normally receive pay on federal holidays, which include Christmas, New Year\'s Day and potentially Martin Luther King Jr. Day.The shutdown affected the employees\' entitlement to paid holidays due to the shutdown.Unemployment assistance to federal workers furloughed under the government shutdown varied by locality.Only non-reporting workers were eligible for assistance, whereas furloughed workers who still reported to work were not.Workers who received unemployment assistance were required pay it back after the shut down ended and they received backpay.Some furloughed workers sought other employment opportunities while they were idled.However, external employment must meet agency-specific ethics guidelines, and mandatory reviews of external employment were also curtailed as most ethics officials were also furloughed.Federal employees were not able to use vacation or sick leave during the shutdown so scheduled holiday vacation time either became unpaid if the worker was deemed non-essential or was cancelled if the worker was deemed essential.In many cases unused leave over a certain threshold expired at year-end, but employees who had leave scheduled in advance of the shutdown did not have ""use or lose"" leave balances deducted from their accrued leave.Many furloughed employees took to crowd-funding campaigns to raise cash to replace missed paychecks, but these types of solicitations also run afoul of government ethics rules.\n\nAs furloughed federal workers and their families shared stories of their hardships, such as not being able to meet rent or mortgage payments and missed bills, the hashtag ""#ShutdownStories"" went viral on social media.The federal government\'s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) responded by publishing sample letters that employees could send to their creditors.One read, in part, ""I am a Federal employee who has recently been furloughed due to a lack of funding of my agency.Because of this, my income has been severely cut and I am unable to pay the entire cost of my mortgage, along with my other expenses.""Other federal workers reached out to other news outlets to share stories about having to stretch their budgets and the impact of the shutdown on their families.In addition to being unable to meet rent or pay bills, many federal workers around the country were unable to pay for groceries and turned to food banks.One federal prison guard in Louisiana attempted suicide after posting about the financial pressures of the shutdown on Facebook.\n\nThe OPM also suggested that employees who had landlords write: ""I would like to discuss with you the possibility of trading my services to perform maintenance (e.g. painting, carpentry work) in exchange for partial rent payments"" and suggested those who lacked funds to pay bills should hire personal attorneys to assist them.Other organizations also posted advice on how to ""find supplemental income""; the Coast Guard suggested that Coast Guard members ""have a garage sale, offer to watch children, walk pets or house sit"" while furloughed.\n\nOn January 4, The Washington Post reported that because the shutdown was triggered by the failure to enact spending bills that continued a federal government pay freeze, hundreds of senior Trump administration political appointees would receive a roughly $10,000 pay raise the following day.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the pending pay raise was an ""unnecessary byproduct of the shutdown.""\n\nOn January 10, the Senate approved by unanimous consent a bill (S.24, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019) providing that furloughed federal employees would receive back pay for the period of the furlough once appropriations were restored; the bill was approved the next day by the House on a vote of 411–7.Trump signed the bill into law on January 16.\n\nNative American tribes were not paid for treaties negotiated with the United States government.These treaties specified that the federal government must provide funding for health clinics, employee salaries, education, infrastructure and other services, which were not paid during the shutdown.Native lands are ""owned, managed and maintained by the federal government.""Native Americans who receive a per capita check for profits from oil and gas sales from tribal land did not receive check for the month of February.Roads were not plowed on tribal land, and some areas received significant snowfall.This caused people of the Navajo Nation to become trapped inside their homes.Food services, which fed 90,000 Native Americans in 2017, were halted.\n\nNative American communities had a high percentage of individuals who worked for the federal government and lost income during the shutdown.In North and South Dakota, one of the largest employers is the Indian Health Service.The Chippewa tribe reported an economic loss of nearly $100,000 daily in funds that the federal government was supposed to provide as a treaty obligation.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was closed for the shutdown.However, 60 percent of the Indian Health Service (IHS) continued to work without pay.IHS provides care for 2.2 million Native Americans and on January 23, began to deny care that was not considered ""life threatening.""The Bureau of Indian Education was able to stay open because it was funded on a different schedule.Unlike other government shutdowns, there was little outreach from the Trump Administration to Native Americans and the Chippewa tribe in Michigan was given a 24-hour notice that the shutdown would take place and affect the tribe.\n\nThe only military branch that was affected by the shutdown was the Coast Guard because it was part of the Department of Homeland Security, while the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps were all funded through the Department of Defense.Officials were able to fund payment on December 31, 2018, but were not able to do so for the paychecks of January 15 and 30, 2019, along with the pay and benefits for civilian workers and retirees.During the shutdown, the Coast Guard continued to engage in patrolling the American coastline and carrying out overseas missions in locations such as the Persian Gulf along with the Navy and in the Caribbean.Other issues arose in the payment processes for Coast Guard members Tricare Health and Dental Program payments, although the individuals were still covered.\n\nMilitary schools, such as the Coast Guard Academy and the National War College, lost funding due to the shutdown and the schools had to work to find funds to pay professors.\n\nAlthough the Department of Defense was not shut down, the February 4, 2019, date for release of the Pentagon\'s 2020 budget was delayed by at least one month.This had repercussions on the interim period which is usually used by Pentagon planners for adjustments before the 2020 fiscal year which will begin in October 2019.The White House Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the Pentagon request, was shut down when the Pentagon budget arrived in December, and remained inactive, so no work was done on the budget.\n\nOn February 25, 2019, the Pentagon\'s counter-drug (interdiction) funding has up to $85 million not yet obligated, but that money was planned for the known corridors in El Paso, Tucson, Yuma, and El Centro for border fencing, lighting, and road projects, so any funds which might possibly be intended for additional projects elsewhere along the border must be obligated by September 30, 2019, in order not to affect the known corridors.Otherwise appropriations above the $85 million not yet obligated for additional interdiction border projects will have to be approved by additional Congressional appropriations, to reach the $2 billion target.\n\nA January 28, 2019 Congressional Budget Office report estimated that the 35-day partial government shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion, including $3 billion in permanent losses; the CBO estimate excluded indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.The furloughing of 145,000 federal workers and 112,500 federal contractors in the Washington Metropolitan Area cost the regional economy $119 million each day, or 7.3% of the region\'s total output.That reduced GDP by over $2.8 billion in the Washington DC area alone.The shutdown also had a noticeable impact on hunger in the national capital region: food pantries in Washington DC and Northern Virginia reported an increase of around 10% in the number of people coming to pick up groceries, with most of that increase coming from federal workers and contractors.\n\nFitch Ratings warned that an extended shutdown might lead to a downgrade in the U.S.\'s Triple-A credit rating if lawmakers were unable to pass a budget or manage the debt ceiling.That in turn would make borrowing more costly for companies and American households, because it is the benchmark for many other lines of credit.The only time the U.S. credit rating has been downgraded by S&P was during the United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011.\n\nSome economists believed that an extended shutdown would weaken consumer confidence and heighten the risk of pushing the U.S. economy into a recession.Between 800,000 federal government employees and some 4 million federal contractors, the shutdown directly affected nearly 3% of the labor force of the United States; in a typical recession, unemployment increases 2–4%.The reduction in spending by those households combined with the reduction of government services could have macroeconomic results similar to a typical recession.The shutdown had an adverse effect on the budgets of state and local governments, as states covered some federal services (particularly the most vulnerable) during the shutdown.\n\nBy mid-January 2019, the White House Council of Economic Advisors estimated that each week of the shutdown reduced GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, the equivalent of 1.2 points per quarter.CEA chairman Kevin Hassett later acknowledged that GDP growth could decline to zero in the first quarter of 2019 if the shutdown lasted the entire quarter.\n\nAs tax season began in the United States on January 28, some 46,000 Internal Revenue Service workers were called back to work to ensure tax refunds and returns were not affected by the shutdown.The recalled workers allowed the department to continue operations that were automatic and those deemed necessary for the safety of human life or protection of government property, such as processing electronic returns, returns with payments, mailing tax forms, appeals, criminal law enforcement investigations and technical support.\n\nDuring the shutdown, 95% of federal staff for the USDA\'s Food and Nutrition Services were furloughed.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the food-stamp program, could be funded through a $3 billion contingency fund appropriated by Congress in 2018; if the shutdown had continued through March 2019, those funds would have been exhausted, leaving some 38 million Americans without food stamps and endangering food security.Concerns were raised that continuation of the shutdown could delay the issuance of some $140 billion in tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees most of the food supply in the U.S.In early January, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner, reported that the FDA suspended food inspections.He noted that inspection of foreign food was continuing as ""almost normal,"" because they are considered vital.Around January 14, ""high-risk"" food inspections resumed.As of January 22, 2019, 46 percent of the FDA were working, though 20 percent of them were working without pay.During the shutdown, two new recalls for contamination with Listeria or Salmonella took place.Consumer advocacy groups advised of food safety issues during the shutdown.Food safety attorney, Bill Marler, advocated against eating ""fresh, uncooked products on the market place.""Because there was a shortage of FDA inspectors, many imported perishable items, such as produce or flowers, were at risk of spoilage.Meat and some egg products are inspected by the USDA\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service.Federal legislation required those inspectors to remain working without pay.\n\nSchool administrations raised concern about how to feed children who purchase food at the schools for lunch, as funding concerns caused some districts to conserve food and funding.Many limited the amount or variation of foods available for the children to purchase, and alerted parents to the concerns and the limited availability of some of the items.Most schools affected were in high-poverty areas, and depended on federally funded lunch programs, such as the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) a federal grant established by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 and operated through the Department of Agriculture.Some 22 million students in nearly 100,000 schools received school meals through that operation.\n\nAs with the January 2018 shutdown, national parks were expected to be open to the extent practical, though there would be no staff and buildings would be closed.The shutdown affected national parks unevenly, some were accessible with bare-bones staffing levels, some operated with money from states or charitable groups, and others were locked off.Diane Regas, president and chief executive of the Trust for Public Land, called upon Trump to close all national parks to protect the public: by the third week of the shutdown, three people had died in national parks.This number was reported as being within \'usual\' levels.At Yosemite National Park, on January 4, 2019, a death from a fall went unreported for a week.\n\nBy January 1, 2019, the problems of neglected trash pileup, overflowing public toilets, and access to first aid were repeated across the Park system.Health and safety concerns were raised, with concerns by scientists that the expansive amount of garbage and human waste could impact water and soil quality, or cause damage to animals in the parks.Other issues that arose due to the shutdown included illegal campsites, protected agriculture being damaged, damaging of government property and trespassing on foot and by vehicle.\n\nNew York kept the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open, as it did during the January 2018 shutdown.Arizona and Utah were able to keep Grand Canyon National Park, Zion National Park, Arches National Park, and Bryce Canyon National Park open and provided services including public restrooms, shuttles and trash collection.Utah\'s funding included visitor centers.The sites closed outright in the southwest alone included Bandelier National Monument and Valles Caldera National Preserve in northern New Mexico, White Sands National Monument in southern New Mexico, Petrified Forest National Park in northern Arizona and Casa Grande Ruins National Monument in south-central Arizona.Access to major parts of Sequoia and Kings Canyon parks were closed, and at Joshua Tree National Park, the administration policy of leaving parks open to visitors despite the staff furloughs resulted in park damage, including the toppling of protected trees.In Texas, Big Bend National Park had no visitor services, such as restrooms.Some trailheads were closed.Regulations continued to be enforced, as the park remained open.Visitors were reminded to remove their own trash and toilet paper.The Alamo remained open but no NPS services were available at the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park.Channel Islands National Park remained open to public access, although services normally provided by the national park service were instead provided by Island Packers Cruises, the company normally in charge of ferries to the islands.\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration closed immediately on December 22, 2018.The Library of Congress, the U.S. Botanic Garden, the Capitol Visitor Center, and the U.S. Capitol Building remained open as they were funded by the 2019 Legislative Branch appropriations bill.The Smithsonian Institution operated on ""prior-year funds"" through January 1, 2019.On January 2, 2019, the Smithsonian Institution initiated an orderly shutdown of all its facilities, including 19 museums in Washington, D.C., and New York City, the National Zoo, and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.The following day, the National Gallery of Art was closed.The National Zoo also closed on January 3, 2019.Tourism attendance on the National Mall was affected.On January 5, 2019, acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt directed the diversion of fee revenue defined by the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to be used to fund minimal maintenance activities so as to preserve access to highly visited parks.\n\nAccording to a January 12, 2019, article in The Economist, on January 11, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was unable to pay its workers who had not been paid since December 22; 55% more of them called in sick than in January 2018.\n\nAs the air traffic controllers were deemed essential employees, they were required to work without pay.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents air traffic controllers, filed a lawsuit against the federal government for the shutdown on January 11, 2019, claiming that requiring 16,000 air traffic controllers to work without being paid violated their constitutional rights and federal minimum wage law.That was the third lawsuit filed against the federal government since the beginning of the shutdown.\n\nAirline and aircraft safety inspectors, on the other hand, were deemed nonessential and furloughed.A news report on January 12, 2019, stated that the Federal Aviation Administration had returned 500 furloughed safety inspectors back to work and would return more to work in the following weeks.As the airline and aircraft safety inspectors were furloughed, the certification process of the Airbus A220 in the US was stalled.Delta Air Lines was forced to delay the launch of the new aircraft, and to use other models of aircraft to serve those routes that was supposed to be served with A220.Many TSA employees also called out sick, most of them because they were trying to find other jobs that would provide immediate paychecks.\n\nThe shutdown initially prevented the National Transportation Safety Board from assisting the Mexican government\'s investigation of the 2018 Puebla helicopter crash that killed a state governor and senator; an exception allowed the NTSB to assist with the Mexican government in the investigation along with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.The NTSB also had to delay several investigations until the government reopened and only continued investigations into accidents that were considered the most serious.Issues in receiving certification and oversight from the FAA led to a month-long delay in the commencement of passenger service at Paine Field in Everett, Washington.\n\nAs the shutdown continued into its fourth week, the unions representing airline pilots, flight attendants and air traffic controllers issued a statement asserting, ""we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play"" because of the shutdown.\n\nSome airports such as the Philadelphia International Airport, launched food and item donations for federal employees who were affected by the shutdown.Other airports such as the Miami International Airport, and the George Bush International Airport, closed down terminals in order to spread out the TSA workers that were available.\n\nOn January 25, flights destined for LaGuardia Airport in New York were halted to a groundstop by FAA officials due to staffing shortages directly as a result of the shutdown.As a result, several flights to and from neighboring airports in the Northeast, specifically Philadelphia and Newark, suffered significant delays of their own.Soon after that, appropriations passed and the government reopened.\n\nThe shutdown delayed software updates to the Boeing 737 MAX airplane which may have caused the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.\n\nDuring the shutdown, court-appointed private lawyers who represent indigent defendants worked without pay.The Federal Judiciary initially had a goal of sustaining paid operations through January 18, 2019.It said it would run out of money to sustain court operations no earlier than January 25, but perhaps as late as February 1.Failing funding, the Judiciary would operate under the terms of the Antideficiency Act.This Act does not allow federal agencies to expend federal funds before an appropriation, nor to accept any voluntary services.The judiciary had 33,000 employees nationwide.Under the Constitution, Supreme Court Justices, appeals court judges and district judges would continue to be paid.\n\nThe shutdown caused many delays and disruptions in cases.Budgets were watched carefully to be able to pay public defenders, DNA testing, informants, and travel costs to interview victims and witnesses.Staffing issues also brought about concerns and constraints with prisons lacking the staff to safely hold attorney-client visits, and caused a delay in bail hearings.\n\nAgents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed in a report released on January 22, 2019, by the FBI Agents Association, that several different investigations were compromised by the shutdown.The report was called ""Voices from the Field"" and was 72 pages long.FBI agents were unable to pay Confidential Human Sources which risks losing that informant permanently.Some FBI divisions no longer have Spanish-speaking staff on hand and could not work with informants who only speak Spanish.Some agents reported that they did not have the funds to assist in joint operations with local law enforcement.\n\nFederal law enforcement agencies working on Native American land worked without pay through the shutdown.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was forced to cancel a trip to the United States/Mexico border in early January due to the shutdown.DHS was also unable to inspect Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities during the shutdown to ensure that immigrants were being held in facilities appropriately.During the shutdown, the federal government\'s e-Verify system—a system for employers to check the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States—was halted.\n\nDuring the shutdown, a wave of Domain Name System (DNS) attacks on government sites was detected by Homeland Security.The attacks were serious because these Internet sites could be hijacked.\n\nOfficial websites for agencies were rendered insecure or inaccessible through the shutdown, as the expired digital certificates were not renewed.On January 23, DHS asked all government agencies to secure their DNS records; however, many agencies were not able to respond quickly to this request.\n\nExecutive and legislative affairs of the local government of the District of Columbia continued operating through the shutdown, due to a provision previously enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017.The District\'s local court system, including the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, are part of the federal judiciary.Thus, they were partially shut down, preventing District residents from accessing services such as marriage licensing.The District of Columbia government said it would take over trash collection and snow plowing operations for National Park Service facilities in Washington.\n\nThe shutdown also interfered with the response to the 2018 Sunda Strait tsunami, as the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta\'s Twitter account was unable to tweet updates, and the United States Geological Survey was unable to provide data on the tsunami.The American weather model, the GFS, suffered a significant drop in forecast quality when a data format change during the shutdown prevented certain weather data from being recognized by the GFS, and the shutdown prevented the bug from being corrected.\n\nBy mid-day Thursday, January 3, 2019, the FCC had suspended operations.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai canceled his trip to the Consumer Electronics Show.The FTC also suspended certain online operations.The EPA and Department of Energy\'s Energy Star website was not available for the duration of the shutdown.\n\nMakers of alcoholic beverages were unable to receive approval from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau for new labels and recipes during the shutdown.\n\nBased on the recalculation of their operating reserves, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) would have had to cease patent operations in the second week of February.A cadre of personnel was allocated to continue receiving patent applications, receive payments, and maintain the IT infrastructure.Even though the USPTO is self-funded, a Congressional appropriation is required to permit the USPTO to spend money.The pipeline of patent applications at the time took 15.8 months for a response from an examiner.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution shortened to two days and downscaled its scheduled ten-day 2019 Folklife Festival on the National Mall because of the shutdown\'s effects.Sabrina Motley, the director of the festival, said that initially, crucial funding for the June—July event arrived later than expected, slowing preparations.Motley stated: ""The government opened back up, but it took a while for systems to come back online. ...We looked at our production schedule, and it became clear we would need more time than we had.""\n\nThe White House residence staff who stage public receptions were among those furloughed, with a minimal staff continuing to work unpaid for the first family.In the midst of the shutdown Trump invited the Clemson Tigers football team to a White House dinner reception on January 14 in recognition of their College Football Playoff National Championship win.On the morning of the reception Trump announced that he intended to serve fast food hamburgers and pizza to the team, a remark that some commentators interpreted as a joke.That evening Trump welcomed the team in the State Dining Room with a buffet of fast food and pizza from McDonald\'s, Wendy\'s and other restaurant chains, which he stated that he had paid for personally.Trump served fast food to other visiting athletes later that year, after the shutdown had ended.\n\nOn January 10, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with several other unions, announced plans to protest the government shutdown at 1:00pm EST in Washington, DC.Leaders of the National Federation of Federal Employees stated they had hoped that bringing federal workers to the President\'s doorstep would show him that it was the individual workers that the shutdown was hurting the most.President Trump had left to visit the US–Mexican border in Texas earlier in the day.\n\nSimilar protests took place in Philadelphia and St. Louis, among other cities.On January 15, representatives for Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, and Vietnam Veterans of America along with others called for an end to shutdown, but avoided placing any blame on political parties.\n\nShortly after the protests, the American Federation of Government Employees sued the Trump administration to challenge the arrangements for work without pay during the shutdown.A similar suit was raised and won during the 2013 Federal Government shutdown.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association also sued the Trump administration, as the shutdown allegedly violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by failing to pay the workers at least a minimum wage during the shutdown.\n\nAs the salaries for members of Congress are written into permanent law and not funded through annual appropriations, the government shutdown did not affect their salaries.Senators and Representatives were still paid their biweekly salaries of $6,700 towards at least $174,000 a year.\n\nSeveral Democratic and Republican Senators and Representatives said they would donate or refuse their salary during the shutdown.Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw stated that he would refuse his salary, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto indicated she would donate hers to a Nevada charity, Senator Mazie Hirono said she would donate her salary to Hawaii food banks, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would give hers to refugee non-profit HIAS, New York Congressman Max Rose stated that he would give his salary to charity and outgoing Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota pledged hers to charity, along with her Republican colleague John Hoeven.Republican senator Kevin Cramer, who defeated Heidi Heitkamp in the 2018 midterm elections, refused to donate his salary, calling the move ""gimmicky"".Representative Brian Fitzpatrick urged all members of Congress to decline their paychecks.He said, ""If you\'re in Congress, don\'t just delay your pay -- forfeit it, write a check back to the US Treasury.Then you\'ll feel the pain of federal workers.""\n\nBy January 17, 2019, 102 members of Congress—20 Senators and 82 Representatives— chose to decline their paychecks or were donating their paychecks to charity.\n\nDuring the shutdown, many federal workers used food banks and food pantries in order to feed themselves and their families.Many food pantries waived certain restrictions in order to help government workers have access to food.During the shutdown, the Salvation Army Emergency Disasters Services program provided meals for federal workers.Chef Jose Andres created the #ChefsForFeds program to feed federal workers in Washington, D.C. and by January 21, made announcements to expand the program nationwide.\n\nSome states such as California, offered furloughed employees unemployment benefits, although the Trump administration allegedly told states that they could not do so with federal funds.Organizations such as state Attorney Generals offices, and credit card companies posted statements to their websites to offer a means to help to consolidate debt, meet mortgages or other payments such as child support or tuition.An employment law firm offered pro bono legal advice to furloughed federal employees.School districts opened up free or reduced lunch options for children of federal employees, and looked into other options to aid parents amid concerns that financial stress at home would adversely affect families and children.Every mainline denomination in America has contributed to efforts to provide relief.One Baptist church emptied its entire disaster fund to aid federal employees.\n\nOn January 24, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross downplayed the financial difficulties faced by the 800,000 federal workers affected by the shutdown, stating that they should borrow money to ""tide them over"" until the shutdown ends.Critics and Democrats criticized the statement as inappropriate, noting that Ross\' own net worth is estimated at almost $700 million, accusing him of being out of touch with the workers.Ross also said that he ""did not understand"" why people who were not getting paid due to the shutdown were visiting food banks.When asked about Ross\' statement, Trump suggested that grocery stores will ""work along"" with the government by voluntarily extending credit to those who are out of funds to buy food.National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow characterized the shutdown as a ""glitch"" and suggested that federal workers who were required to work without pay were ""volunteering"" to work for their love of the country and ""presumably their allegiance to President Trump.""\n\nIn a video message to staff, FBI director Christopher Wray stated, ""Making some people stay home when they don\'t want to, and making others show up without pay, it\'s mind-boggling, it\'s shortsighted and it\'s unfair.It takes a lot to get me angry, but I\'m about as angry as I\'ve been in a long, long time.""\n\nLara Trump, a daughter-in-law of the President, drew outrage after an interview in which she stated that while ""It\'s not fair to you..."" the shutdown was ""...a little bit of pain, but it\'s going to be for the future of our country, and their children and their grandchildren and generations after them will thank them for their sacrifice right now.""Her comments drew criticism by politicians, celebrities, and the general public who felt the advisor and spokeswoman for the Trump 2020 campaign was out of touch, however Lara Trump later claimed the comments were taken out of context.\n\nIn January 2019, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that 56% of the responding public opposed a wall while 39% favored it, and 45% viewed the situation at the border as a crisis.The numbers were similar to the poll in December 2018 yet a later poll by ABC News showed that as the partial shutdown entered its fourth week support for building a wall was increasing.A poll done through YouGov between December 23–25, 2018, reported that 51% of respondents thought Trump deserved ""a lot"" of the blame, 44% thought congressional Democrats and 39% thought congressional Republicans.Similar results were reported by a December 21–25 survey done by Reuters and Ipsos in which 47% of respondents said that the shutdown was the President\'s fault and 33% blamed Congressional Democrats.\n\nOver the course of the shutdown, Trump\'s approval rating marginally declined while his disapproval rating marginally increased.His net approval rating was by the middle of January 2019 at its lowest point since February 2018.On December 27, 2018, it was reported that Trump\'s approval rating of registered voters was at 39%, with 56% disapproval.Broken down the rating was split across party lines, with Republicans reporting an 80% approval rate while Democrats and independents reported a 90% and 57% disapproval rating, respectively.The poll was conducted through Morning Consult between December 21–23.The poll also reported that 43% of respondents blamed Trump for the shutdown, with 31% blaming congressional Democrats and 7% congressional Republicans.Another poll through The New York Times Upshot/Siena College reported that 89% of voters\' views on Trump and the wall were aligned, suggesting that support for the wall was a function of support for Trump.\n\nThe Washington Post–ABC News poll published on January 13, 2019, found that a larger number of Americans blamed Trump and congressional Republicans than congressional Democrats for the shutdown.A PBS NewsHour–Marist poll found that on January 15, 2019, a majority of Americans thought that President Trump was to blame for the shutdown.A January 2019 poll conducted by telephone for CBS News found that 70% of Americans polled did not want a government shutdown over the issue of building a border wall; 66% believed that Trump should agree to a budget without wall funding.\n\nPresidency of Donald Trump Donald Trump January 2018 United

44,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018–2019 United States federal government shutdown', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The United States federal government shutdown from midnight EST on December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019 (35 days) was the longest government shutdown in history and the second and final federal government shutdown involving furloughs during the presidency of Donald Trump.It occurred when the 115th Congress and Trump could not agree on an appropriations bill to fund the operations of the federal government for the 2019 fiscal year, or a temporary continuing resolution that would extend the deadline for passing a bill.The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal departments or agencies from conducting non-essential operations without appropriations legislation in place.As a result, nine executive departments with around 800,000 employees had to shut down partially or in full, affecting about one-fourth of government activities and causing employees to be furloughed or required to work without being paid.The Congressional Budget Office estimated the shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion USD, excluding indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.\n\nThe shutdown stemmed from an impasse over Trump\'s demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall.In December 2018, the Senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the bill appeared likely to be approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Trump.After Trump faced heavy criticism from some right-wing media outlets and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to ""build the wall"", he announced that he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund its construction.As a result, the House passed a stopgap bill with funding for the wall, but it was blocked in the Senate by the threat of a Democratic filibuster.\n\nIn January 2019, representatives elected in the November 2018 election took office, giving the Democrats a majority in the House.The House immediately voted to approve the appropriations bill that had previously passed the Senate unanimously (which included no funding for the wall).For several weeks, Trump continued to maintain that he would veto any bill that did not fund an entire border wall, and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the Senate from considering any appropriations legislation that Trump would not support, including the bill that had previously passed.Democrats and some Republicans opposed the shutdown and passed multiple bills to reopen the government, arguing that the government shutdown amounted to ""hostage-taking"" civil servants and that negotiations could only begin once the government was reopened.\n\nOn January 25, 2019, Trump agreed to endorse a stopgap bill to reopen the government for three weeks up until February 15 to allow for negotiations to take place to approve an appropriations bill that both parties could agree on.However, Trump reiterated his demand for the border wall funding and said that he would shut down the government again or declare a national emergency and use military funding to build the wall if Congress did not appropriate the funds by February 15.\n\nTrump\'s approval rating dropped during the shutdown.A majority of Americans opposed exploitation of the shutdown as a negotiating strategy and held Trump responsible for the shutdown: A CBS News poll found that 71% of Americans considered the border wall ""not worth the shutdown"" and a Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 53% of Americans blamed Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, compared to 34% who blamed Democrats and 10% who blamed both parties.\n\nOn February 15, 2019, Trump declared a national emergency to fund the wall and bypass Congress, after being unsatisfied with a bipartisan border bill that had passed the House and the Senate a day before.\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign, then-candidate Trump promised to build a wall along the Mexico–United States border for which Mexico would pay.The president of Mexico rejected the idea of providing any funding for a U.S. border wall.In 2018, Trump requested $ in federal funding for some of barrier on the border, mostly to replace of aging fence built under the Secure Fence Act of 2006.On December 25, 2018, Trump reversed course, suggesting that he might accept of either mostly refurbished barrier (rather than new barriers in locations that did not previously have them) by November 2020.Trump\'s proposals and public statements on the wall have shifted widely over time, with varied proposals as to the design, material, length, height, and width of a wall.\n\nIn September 2018, Congress passed two ""minibus"" appropriations bills for the 2019 United States federal budget, which began on October 1, 2018.These bills combined five of the 12 regular appropriations bills covering 77% of federal discretionary funding, and included a continuing resolution until December 7 for the remaining agencies.On December 6, Congress passed a second continuing resolution to December 21, to give more time for negotiations on Trump\'s proposed border wall, which had been delayed due to the funeral of George H. W. Bush.\n\nA Senate Homeland Security appropriations bill, negotiated by both parties and reported by the committee to the Senate, provided for $ for border security, including funds for ""approximately 65 miles of pedestrian fencing along the southwest border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector"".The bill did not receive a vote on the Senate floor, although House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer indicated that such a proposal could be acceptable to House Democrats.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said the Democratic Party would not support $ for the border wall.At a press conference before the government shutdown, he noted ""the $1.6 billion for border security negotiated by Democrats and Republicans is our position.We believe that is the right way to go.""\n\nOn December 11, President Trump held a televised meeting with Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in the Oval Office and asked them to support an appropriation of $5.7 billion for funding of a border wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico.They refused, resulting in an argument between Trump and both Congressional leaders.During the contentious discussion, Trump remarked, ""I am proud to shut down the government for border security ...I will be the one to shut [the government] down.I\'m not going to blame you for it ...I will take the mantle.I will be the one to shut it down.""Schumer replied, ""We shouldn\'t shut down the government over a dispute.""Ten days later, Trump blamed Democrats for the impending shutdown.\n\nThree days later, Politico reported that Trump was willing to sign a bill with no funding for a border wall that delayed a government shutdown into 2019 and the new Congress.On December 18, following a meeting with Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the government would not shut down on December 22 and that Trump was ""flexible"" over funding for a border wall.Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby commented that the most likely resolution was a bill that funded the government until early February.Schumer added that his caucus would ""very seriously"" consider such a bill and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said ""I don\'t know anybody on the Hill that wants a shutdown, and I think all the president\'s advisers are telling him this would not be good.""\n\nOn December 19, the Senate passed a second continuing resolution () that would fund the government until February 8, 2019.Pelosi announced that House Democrats would support the measure, meaning it would overcome opposition from conservative Republicans and pass the House.On December 20, following increased criticism from conservative media, pundits, and political figures, Trump reversed his position and declared that he would not sign any funding bill that did not include border wall funding.The same day, the House passed a continuing resolution that included $5 billion for the wall and $8 billion in disaster aid.This bill failed in the Senate.Trump\'s changing position caused consternation among Senate Republicans.\n\nThe shutdown started December 22 and Trump announced that he would cancel his planned trip to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas and stay in Washington, D.C.The meaning of the term ""wall"" was expected to be an aspect of the negotiations.\n\nCongress adjourned on December 22 for the Christmas and holiday season, with many predicting that the shutdown would not be resolved until the start of the 116th Congress.The Senate reconvened on December 27 for four minutes, with Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) presiding over the session.The House briefly reconvened as well, with Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) saying that members should not expect any further votes for the rest of 2018.Representative Jim McGovern (D-MA) went to the House floor to try to force consideration of a short-term funding bill to end the shutdown that the Senate had already passed, but the Republican Speaker-pro-tem refused to let him speak.\n\nCongress then adjourned again until December 31, 2018, for a pro forma session.On January 2, 2019, the last full day of the 115th United States Congress, there was a pro forma session scheduled to last several minutes.\n\nThe new Congress was sworn in on January 3, 2019, and one of the first orders of business in the House after electing the Speaker and swearing in the new members was a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security until February 8 (), which passed by a vote of 239–192; and a package combining five appropriation bills funding the rest of the government for the remainder of the fiscal year (), passed by a vote of 241–190.The bills contained $1.3 billion of funding for border security, but no additional funding for a border wall.\n\nBeginning on January 9, the Democratic-controlled House voted on four appropriations bills individually:\n\nFinancial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Treasury (including the Internal Revenue Service), federal judiciary, District of Columbia, and a number of independent agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, General Services Administration, and Securities and Exchange Commission.The House passed the legislation on January 9, on a 240–188 vote, with every Democrat and eight Republicans voting yes, and all other Republicans voting no. Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Department of Agriculture (including food stamps), the Food and Drug Administration, and related entities.On January 10, the House passed this bill 243–183.Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore Transportation and Housing and Urban Development (including some federal mortgage programs).On January 10, the House passed this bill 244–180.Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Interior Department, Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies, including the Smithsonian Institution.On January 11, ten House Republicans voted with Democrats in a 240–179 vote to end the shutdown of Interior-Environment programs.It was the most recent of a ""series of standalone appropriations measures"" the House sent to the Senate.\n\nThis strategy has been compared to one used by Republicans during the 2013 shutdown in the form of a series of fourteen mini-continuing resolutions.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed that the Senate would not consider the House bills to reopen the government, indicating that Senate Republicans would not support any bill unless it had Trump\'s support.In January 2019, McConnell and Senate Republicans came under increased pressure to break the impasse and reopen the government.Three Republican Senators—Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Cory Gardner of Colorado—called for an end to the shutdown.Senators Collins and Gardner said they supported the House\'s budget bills to end the shutdown.West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito said that she could support ending the shutdown provided border wall talks continued.Pat Roberts of Kansas said that shutdowns ""never work"" and only turned affected federal workers into ""pawns"" and that, although the time had not yet come for Senate Republicans to override any possible Trump veto and end the shutdown, ""we\'re getting pretty close.""Johnny Isakson of Georgia echoed that sentiment, saying that support for McConnell\'s refusal to support bills that do not include funding for a wall would not last indefinitely: ""There\'s a time when that may run out.""\n\nOn January 16, McConnell again blocked the House appropriation bills to reopen the government from being considered on the Senate floor.The following day, McConnell blocked consideration of bills to reopen most of the closed government agencies for a third time.On January 23, McConnell blocked a bill to reopen most of the government for the fourth time.\n\nOn January 22, McConnell stated that the Senate would be voting on two different bills to end the shutdown on January 24.The first vote is on a bill to reopen the government which includes Trump\'s proposal to provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and temporary protections to some immigration classes.The other bill is a three-week continuing resolution to fund 25% of the government through February 8.\n\nOn January 22, Senator Mark Warner introduced a bill to keep the federal government running in the event of future shutdown events.The bill is called the ""Stop Shutdowns Transferring Unnecessary Pain and Inflicting Damage in the Coming Years Act"" or the ""Stop STUPIDITY Act"".\n\nOn January 24, the Senate held two votes on competing Democratic and Republican proposals to end the shutdown.The Democratic proposal was largely similar to the measure that had previously passed the Senate unanimously in the 115th Congress, and then been passed by the Democratic-controlled House in the 116th Congress.It provided funding for the government with no money for the border wall.The Republican proposal incorporated Trump\'s proposal, which would fund a border wall; temporarily extend TPS and DACA for three years, but would substantially narrow eligibility for DACA; and make significant legal changes to make it more difficult for persons escaping violence and persecution to be granted asylum in the United States.Neither proposal was able to attain the 60 votes needed for passage.The Trump plan failed in a 50–47 vote.The Democratic plan failed in a 52–44 vote.Most Republicans voted for Trump\'s plan and against the Democratic plan.Most Democrats voted for the Democratic plan and against Trump\'s plan.Republicans Tom Cotton and Mike Lee voted against both plans.Democrat Joe Manchin and Republicans Lamar Alexander, Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, Johnny Isakson, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney voted for both plans.Not voting on either were Republicans Rand Paul and Jim Risch and Democrat Jacky Rosen.Republican Richard Burr voted for Trump\'s plan and did not vote on the Democratic plan.\n\nOn January 25, House Democrats prepared a compromise proposal to reopen the government, which would provide $5 billion for border security but no wall construction.However, the shutdown ended the same day.\n\nOn January 4, after the new Congress was sworn-in and Pelosi regained the speakership, she and Schumer, as well as congressional Republican leadership met with Trump at the White House.Pelosi and Schumer argued that the shutdown needed to end and reported that Trump refused.They said that Trump threatened to ""keep the government closed for a very long period of time.Months or even years.""Later that day, Trump admitted to ""absolutely"" making that threat, adding, ""I\'m very proud of doing what I\'m doing.""Trump then said that he was considering declaring a national emergency to use military funding for the wall.At the meeting, Trump reprimanded his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney for attempting to propose a compromise between Trump\'s $5.7 billion demand for a border wall and the Democrats\' proposal of $1.3 billion for border security.\n\nTrump addressed the nation from the Oval Office at 9 p.m. EST on January 8, in a nationally televised address broadcast on both network and cable television.In his speech, Trump asserted that there was a ""growing humanitarian and security crisis"" on the Mexico–United States border that could only be solved by appropriating $5.7 billion for construction of a steel wall.Trump did not make any new proposals in his speech to break the impasse.Immediately after Trump\'s speech, Schumer and Pelosi delivered a response on behalf of the Democrats, in which they demanded an end to the shutdown and said: ""President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government.""\n\nTrump met with congressional leadership again on January 9, in a meeting lasting 14 minutes.Trump asked Pelosi, ""Will you agree to my wall?"" and when she replied that she would not, Trump said ""bye-bye"" and walked out of the meeting, later declaring it ""a total waste of time"".Schumer accused Trump of throwing a ""temper tantrum"" and slamming his hands on the table.Trump rebuked Schumer\'s comments on Twitter.Vice President Mike Pence and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that Trump remained calm and never raised his voice.On January 10, Pelosi described the preceding day\'s meeting with Trump as ""a setup"" staged by White House aides so that Trump could walk out of the meeting.Pelosi described Trump as ""un-presidential""; accused him of ""exploiting this situation in a way that enhances his power""; and said: ""I don\'t think he really wants a solution.I think he loves the distraction.""\n\nAfter Trump walked out of the January 9 meeting with congressional Democratic leaders, no further negotiations were conducted.Several Republican senators met in the office of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, after the meeting to discuss a compromise to end the shutdown.They discussed agreeing to Trump\'s demand for border wall funding and offering the Democrats help for Dreamers, refugee protections and extensions to H-2B visas.On January 13, Graham proposed that Trump agree to a congressional vote to reopen the government pending the resumption of negotiations.Graham suggested that if Trump and congressional Democrats did not come to an agreement at that time, Trump could declare a national emergency.Trump rejected this proposal the next day.\n\nOn January 19, Trump proposed a temporary extension of the two programs that protect about 700,000 immigrants from deportation—Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)—in exchange for funding for the border wall.The protections would be temporary, with no path to citizenship.Trump had previously revoked TPS for people from a number of Latin American and African countries, and taken steps to rescind DACA.In his remarks at the White House, Trump referred to a ""barrier"" rather than a ""wall"" and indicated that he aimed to erect ""steel barriers in high priority locations"" rather than ""a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea.""\n\nIn addition to funding a border wall, the 1,300-page Republican bill released after Trump made his proposal would make major changes to U.S. immigration policy (which were not included in Trump\'s public announcement).The legislation would severely restrict the ability of children from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to apply for asylum in the United States.Specifically, participation in the Central American Minors Program would be subject to an annual cap and migrant children would be barred from applying for asylum in person at the border, and only migrant children with a ""qualified"" parent in the U.S. would be eligible to apply.The bill would also create a new, more burdensome application process for TPS holders, and would exclude TPS holders from Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen.The American Immigration Lawyers Association government relations director said that the proposal ""would categorically block tens of thousands of children from ever applying for asylum,"" while a Cato Institute immigration analyst wrote that the proposal would not extend DACA, but rather replace it with ""a totally different program that will exclude untold thousands of Dreamers who would have been eligible under DACA.""\n\nDemocrats rejected Trump\'s proposal.In a speech on the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""The president\'s proposal is one-sided, harshly partisan and was made in bad faith.The asylum changes are a poison pill, if there ever was one.""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said extending the DACA proposal temporarily was ""unacceptable"" and a ""non-starter"" because it did not ""represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people\'s lives.""Analysts pointed out that Trump had previously rejected a deal that would have provided funding for the border wall in exchange for further protection for DACA recipients.Conversely, Republicans reacted positively to Trump\'s proposal, and Mitch McConnell said he would bring it to a vote in the Senate.\n\nDuring the shutdown, on January 8 in a press conference, a reporter asked Trump if he was considering declaring a national emergency, to which Trump replied, ""I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want"" and suggested that he could declare an emergency.After this, Trump repeatedly threatened to declare a national emergency to unilaterally order wall construction without congressional authorization.Some of Trump\'s advisors, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, reportedly attempted to dissuade him from doing so.Administration officials considered diverting hurricane-relief and wildfire-relief funds from a $13.9 billion February 2018 emergency supplemental appropriations bill (for disaster relief in Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California, among other places) in order to fund a wall, and directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to look into this possibility.\n\nAn attempt by Trump to invoke emergency powers would almost certainly have prompted a lengthy legal challenge in court.Democrats responded that Trump lacked the authority to declare a national emergency; Representative Adam Schiff called it a ""non-starter"" and said that ""if Harry Truman couldn\'t nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this President doesn\'t have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion dollar wall on the border.""Democratic Representative Nydia Velázquez said the notion of redirecting disaster-relief funds to a border wall was ""beyond appalling"".Presidents have declared emergencies in the past, but none has ""involved funding a policy goal after failing to win congressional approval"".Yale Law School professor Bruce Ackerman wrote that the declaration of a national emergency to build a wall as Trump suggested would be unconstitutional and illegal.Other scholars, such as Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice, believed that Trump could make a colorable argument that diverting military-construction appropriations for border-wall construction was legal, but that doing so would be an abuse of power.Law professor Ilya Somin stated that in the unlikely case that Trump succeeded in using the emergency powers in this way, it would set a dangerous precedent, which Republicans would come to regret next time the president was a Democrat.\n\nOn January 11, Trump—while maintaining he has the authority to do so anytime—said he was not in any rush to declare a national emergency to secure wall funding, saying he would rather see Congress ""do its job"" and that the Democrats ""should come back and vote.""The next day he again threatened to use emergency powers if Democrats did not ""come to their senses.""\n\nOn January 16, Pelosi sent a letter to Trump that indicated the House would be unavailable for the 2019 State of the Union Address that was scheduled for January 29.Pelosi wrote, ""Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government reopens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has reopened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on Jan. 29.""The delivery of the State of the Union address had been delayed or substantially changed on only two occasions since 1913.In a letter sent to the Speaker the next day, Trump said she would not be allowed to take military transport aircraft on scheduled visits to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan.Trump replied, ""We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the shutdown is over.""Pelosi and a congressional delegation had planned on visiting overseas American military personnel.\n\nOn January 23, Trump sent a letter to Pelosi insisting that there were no security concerns and that he would hold the State of the Union Address as scheduled.Trump wrote, ""Therefore, I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and Congress of the United States of America regarding the State of our Union.""In a letter sent in reply, Pelosi stated that the House would not consider a concurrent resolution to authorize the State of the Union Address in the House Chamber until the shutdown ended, writing, ""Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened.""\n\nTrump later stated he would look for an alternative, but then retracted that statement in a pair of tweets announcing that he would wait until the end of the shutdown to give the address in the House Chamber.\n\nOn January 25, Trump announced his support for a three-week funding measure that would reopen the government until February 15.The deal, which also moved forward with long-term Department of Homeland Security funding, did not include funds for a wall.As expected, the agreement provided federal employees with back pay.Both the Senate and House of Representatives passed the funding measure by voice vote, sending the resolution to the President\'s desk.Trump signed the bill the same day, ending the shutdown.\n\nLater in January, Republican senators voted unanimously against a bill to provide back pay to federal contractors.\n\nWithout legislation enacted by February 15, a new partial shutdown would have begun, three weeks after the last ended.A bipartisan group of senators and representatives reached an agreement ""in principle"" on February 11, but Trump did not say whether he would sign it.Included was $1.375 billion for 55 miles of steel border fencing.On February 13, it was reported that, against the wishes of Democratic leaders and many Republicans, Trump was blocking the provision of back pay to federal contractors who were still out of pocket from the shutdown.Both houses passed the bill February 14 with enough votes to override a veto if that happened.\n\nOn February 15, at the White House Rose Garden, Trump announced that he had signed the spending bill to keep the government open.He also declared a national emergency, hoping to get access to $8 billion to use for border security.\n\nAgencies funded by two ""minibus"" appropriations bills passed in September 2018 were not affected by the shutdown.About 380,000 federal employees were furloughed, and an additional 420,000 employees for the affected agencies were expected to work with their pay delayed until the end of the shutdown, totaling 800,000 workers affected out of 2.1 million civilian non-postal federal employees.As only about a quarter of the government was shut down, many people who are not federal employees did not fully realize the effects of the shutdown.\n\nAccording to and , these were the affected agencies:\n\nDepartment of State Department of the Treasury Department of Justice Most of the Department of the Interior Department of Agriculture Department of Commerce Department of Housing and Urban Development Department of Transportation Department of Homeland Security Some Department of Health and Human Services agencies Food and Drug Administration Indian Health Service Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Superfund Research Program Executive Office of the President Most independent agencies Judicial Branch\n\nUnaffected agencies include, according to and :\n\nDepartment of Defense Department of Labor Most of the Department of Health and Human Services Department of Energy Department of Education Department of Veterans Affairs Some Department of the Interior agencies Bureau of Reclamation Central Utah Project District of Columbia (excluding courts) Legislative Branch Social Security Administration Nuclear Regulatory Commission Appalachian Regional Commission Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board Delta Regional Authority Denali Commission Northern Border Regional Commission Southeast Crescent Regional Commission Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board American Battle Monuments Commission U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Cemeterial Expenses of the Army, including Arlington National Cemetery and Soldiers\' and Airmen\'s Home National Cemetery Armed Forces Retirement Home Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System Fund Intelligence Community Management Account Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled Corporation for National and Community Service Corporation for Public Broadcasting Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission Institute of Museum and Library Services Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission Medicare Payment Advisory Commission National Council on Disability National Labor Relations Board National Mediation Board Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission Railroad Retirement Board\n\nJobs affected included staff throughout the United States, not just DC area employees.FBI agents, federal corrections officers, FDA inspectors, NASA employees, TSA staff, Border Patrol staff and CBP officers, census staff, National Park Service staff, members of the Coast Guard, and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers either worked without pay or were furloughed, with increasing numbers of unpaid essential employees failing to show up for work.\n\nOn January 11, 800,000 workers for agencies shutdown or furloughed missed their first paycheck.Federal workers normally receive pay on federal holidays, which include Christmas, New Year\'s Day and potentially Martin Luther King Jr. Day.The shutdown affected the employees\' entitlement to paid holidays due to the shutdown.Unemployment assistance to federal workers furloughed under the government shutdown varied by locality.Only non-reporting workers were eligible for assistance, whereas furloughed workers who still reported to work were not.Workers who received unemployment assistance were required pay it back after the shut down ended and they received backpay.Some furloughed workers sought other employment opportunities while they were idled.However, external employment must meet agency-specific ethics guidelines, and mandatory reviews of external employment were also curtailed as most ethics officials were also furloughed.Federal employees were not able to use vacation or sick leave during the shutdown so scheduled holiday vacation time either became unpaid if the worker was deemed non-essential or was cancelled if the worker was deemed essential.In many cases unused leave over a certain threshold expired at year-end, but employees who had leave scheduled in advance of the shutdown did not have ""use or lose"" leave balances deducted from their accrued leave.Many furloughed employees took to crowd-funding campaigns to raise cash to replace missed paychecks, but these types of solicitations also run afoul of government ethics rules.\n\nAs furloughed federal workers and their families shared stories of their hardships, such as not being able to meet rent or mortgage payments and missed bills, the hashtag ""#ShutdownStories"" went viral on social media.The federal government\'s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) responded by publishing sample letters that employees could send to their creditors.One read, in part, ""I am a Federal employee who has recently been furloughed due to a lack of funding of my agency.Because of this, my income has been severely cut and I am unable to pay the entire cost of my mortgage, along with my other expenses.""Other federal workers reached out to other news outlets to share stories about having to stretch their budgets and the impact of the shutdown on their families.In addition to being unable to meet rent or pay bills, many federal workers around the country were unable to pay for groceries and turned to food banks.One federal prison guard in Louisiana attempted suicide after posting about the financial pressures of the shutdown on Facebook.\n\nThe OPM also suggested that employees who had landlords write: ""I would like to discuss with you the possibility of trading my services to perform maintenance (e.g. painting, carpentry work) in exchange for partial rent payments"" and suggested those who lacked funds to pay bills should hire personal attorneys to assist them.Other organizations also posted advice on how to ""find supplemental income""; the Coast Guard suggested that Coast Guard members ""have a garage sale, offer to watch children, walk pets or house sit"" while furloughed.\n\nOn January 4, The Washington Post reported that because the shutdown was triggered by the failure to enact spending bills that continued a federal government pay freeze, hundreds of senior Trump administration political appointees would receive a roughly $10,000 pay raise the following day.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the pending pay raise was an ""unnecessary byproduct of the shutdown.""\n\nOn January 10, the Senate approved by unanimous consent a bill (S.24, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019) providing that furloughed federal employees would receive back pay for the period of the furlough once appropriations were restored; the bill was approved the next day by the House on a vote of 411–7.Trump signed the bill into law on January 16.\n\nNative American tribes were not paid for treaties negotiated with the United States government.These treaties specified that the federal government must provide funding for health clinics, employee salaries, education, infrastructure and other services, which were not paid during the shutdown.Native lands are ""owned, managed and maintained by the federal government.""Native Americans who receive a per capita check for profits from oil and gas sales from tribal land did not receive check for the month of February.Roads were not plowed on tribal land, and some areas received significant snowfall.This caused people of the Navajo Nation to become trapped inside their homes.Food services, which fed 90,000 Native Americans in 2017, were halted.\n\nNative American communities had a high percentage of individuals who worked for the federal government and lost income during the shutdown.In North and South Dakota, one of the largest employers is the Indian Health Service.The Chippewa tribe reported an economic loss of nearly $100,000 daily in funds that the federal government was supposed to provide as a treaty obligation.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was closed for the shutdown.However, 60 percent of the Indian Health Service (IHS) continued to work without pay.IHS provides care for 2.2 million Native Americans and on January 23, began to deny care that was not considered ""life threatening.""The Bureau of Indian Education was able to stay open because it was funded on a different schedule.Unlike other government shutdowns, there was little outreach from the Trump Administration to Native Americans and the Chippewa tribe in Michigan was given a 24-hour notice that the shutdown would take place and affect the tribe.\n\nThe only military branch that was affected by the shutdown was the Coast Guard because it was part of the Department of Homeland Security, while the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps were all funded through the Department of Defense.Officials were able to fund payment on December 31, 2018, but were not able to do so for the paychecks of January 15 and 30, 2019, along with the pay and benefits for civilian workers and retirees.During the shutdown, the Coast Guard continued to engage in patrolling the American coastline and carrying out overseas missions in locations such as the Persian Gulf along with the Navy and in the Caribbean.Other issues arose in the payment processes for Coast Guard members Tricare Health and Dental Program payments, although the individuals were still covered.\n\nMilitary schools, such as the Coast Guard Academy and the National War College, lost funding due to the shutdown and the schools had to work to find funds to pay professors.\n\nAlthough the Department of Defense was not shut down, the February 4, 2019, date for release of the Pentagon\'s 2020 budget was delayed by at least one month.This had repercussions on the interim period which is usually used by Pentagon planners for adjustments before the 2020 fiscal year which will begin in October 2019.The White House Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the Pentagon request, was shut down when the Pentagon budget arrived in December, and remained inactive, so no work was done on the budget.\n\nOn February 25, 2019, the Pentagon\'s counter-drug (interdiction) funding has up to $85 million not yet obligated, but that money was planned for the known corridors in El Paso, Tucson, Yuma, and El Centro for border fencing, lighting, and road projects, so any funds which might possibly be intended for additional projects elsewhere along the border must be obligated by September 30, 2019, in order not to affect the known corridors.Otherwise appropriations above the $85 million not yet obligated for additional interdiction border projects will have to be approved by additional Congressional appropriations, to reach the $2 billion target.\n\nA January 28, 2019 Congressional Budget Office report estimated that the 35-day partial government shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion, including $3 billion in permanent losses; the CBO estimate excluded indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.The furloughing of 145,000 federal workers and 112,500 federal contractors in the Washington Metropolitan Area cost the regional economy $119 million each day, or 7.3% of the region\'s total output.That reduced GDP by over $2.8 billion in the Washington DC area alone.The shutdown also had a noticeable impact on hunger in the national capital region: food pantries in Washington DC and Northern Virginia reported an increase of around 10% in the number of people coming to pick up groceries, with most of that increase coming from federal workers and contractors.\n\nFitch Ratings warned that an extended shutdown might lead to a downgrade in the U.S.\'s Triple-A credit rating if lawmakers were unable to pass a budget or manage the debt ceiling.That in turn would make borrowing more costly for companies and American households, because it is the benchmark for many other lines of credit.The only time the U.S. credit rating has been downgraded by S&P was during the United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011.\n\nSome economists believed that an extended shutdown would weaken consumer confidence and heighten the risk of pushing the U.S. economy into a recession.Between 800,000 federal government employees and some 4 million federal contractors, the shutdown directly affected nearly 3% of the labor force of the United States; in a typical recession, unemployment increases 2–4%.The reduction in spending by those households combined with the reduction of government services could have macroeconomic results similar to a typical recession.The shutdown had an adverse effect on the budgets of state and local governments, as states covered some federal services (particularly the most vulnerable) during the shutdown.\n\nBy mid-January 2019, the White House Council of Economic Advisors estimated that each week of the shutdown reduced GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, the equivalent of 1.2 points per quarter.CEA chairman Kevin Hassett later acknowledged that GDP growth could decline to zero in the first quarter of 2019 if the shutdown lasted the entire quarter.\n\nAs tax season began in the United States on January 28, some 46,000 Internal Revenue Service workers were called back to work to ensure tax refunds and returns were not affected by the shutdown.The recalled workers allowed the department to continue operations that were automatic and those deemed necessary for the safety of human life or protection of government property, such as processing electronic returns, returns with payments, mailing tax forms, appeals, criminal law enforcement investigations and technical support.\n\nDuring the shutdown, 95% of federal staff for the USDA\'s Food and Nutrition Services were furloughed.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the food-stamp program, could be funded through a $3 billion contingency fund appropriated by Congress in 2018; if the shutdown had continued through March 2019, those funds would have been exhausted, leaving some 38 million Americans without food stamps and endangering food security.Concerns were raised that continuation of the shutdown could delay the issuance of some $140 billion in tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees most of the food supply in the U.S.In early January, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner, reported that the FDA suspended food inspections.He noted that inspection of foreign food was continuing as ""almost normal,"" because they are considered vital.Around January 14, ""high-risk"" food inspections resumed.As of January 22, 2019, 46 percent of the FDA were working, though 20 percent of them were working without pay.During the shutdown, two new recalls for contamination with Listeria or Salmonella took place.Consumer advocacy groups advised of food safety issues during the shutdown.Food safety attorney, Bill Marler, advocated against eating ""fresh, uncooked products on the market place.""Because there was a shortage of FDA inspectors, many imported perishable items, such as produce or flowers, were at risk of spoilage.Meat and some egg products are inspected by the USDA\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service.Federal legislation required those inspectors to remain working without pay.\n\nSchool administrations raised concern about how to feed children who purchase food at the schools for lunch, as funding concerns caused some districts to conserve food and funding.Many limited the amount or variation of foods available for the children to purchase, and alerted parents to the concerns and the limited availability of some of the items.Most schools affected were in high-poverty areas, and depended on federally funded lunch programs, such as the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) a federal grant established by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 and operated through the Department of Agriculture.Some 22 million students in nearly 100,000 schools received school meals through that operation.\n\nAs with the January 2018 shutdown, national parks were expected to be open to the extent practical, though there would be no staff and buildings would be closed.The shutdown affected national parks unevenly, some were accessible with bare-bones staffing levels, some operated with money from states or charitable groups, and others were locked off.Diane Regas, president and chief executive of the Trust for Public Land, called upon Trump to close all national parks to protect the public: by the third week of the shutdown, three people had died in national parks.This number was reported as being within \'usual\' levels.At Yosemite National Park, on January 4, 2019, a death from a fall went unreported for a week.\n\nBy January 1, 2019, the problems of neglected trash pileup, overflowing public toilets, and access to first aid were repeated across the Park system.Health and safety concerns were raised, with concerns by scientists that the expansive amount of garbage and human waste could impact water and soil quality, or cause damage to animals in the parks.Other issues that arose due to the shutdown included illegal campsites, protected agriculture being damaged, damaging of government property and trespassing on foot and by vehicle.\n\nNew York kept the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open, as it did during the January 2018 shutdown.Arizona and Utah were able to keep Grand Canyon National Park, Zion National Park, Arches National Park, and Bryce Canyon National Park open and provided services including public restrooms, shuttles and trash collection.Utah\'s funding included visitor centers.The sites closed outright in the southwest alone included Bandelier National Monument and Valles Caldera National Preserve in northern New Mexico, White Sands National Monument in southern New Mexico, Petrified Forest National Park in northern Arizona and Casa Grande Ruins National Monument in south-central Arizona.Access to major parts of Sequoia and Kings Canyon parks were closed, and at Joshua Tree National Park, the administration policy of leaving parks open to visitors despite the staff furloughs resulted in park damage, including the toppling of protected trees.In Texas, Big Bend National Park had no visitor services, such as restrooms.Some trailheads were closed.Regulations continued to be enforced, as the park remained open.Visitors were reminded to remove their own trash and toilet paper.The Alamo remained open but no NPS services were available at the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park.Channel Islands National Park remained open to public access, although services normally provided by the national park service were instead provided by Island Packers Cruises, the company normally in charge of ferries to the islands.\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration closed immediately on December 22, 2018.The Library of Congress, the U.S. Botanic Garden, the Capitol Visitor Center, and the U.S. Capitol Building remained open as they were funded by the 2019 Legislative Branch appropriations bill.The Smithsonian Institution operated on ""prior-year funds"" through January 1, 2019.On January 2, 2019, the Smithsonian Institution initiated an orderly shutdown of all its facilities, including 19 museums in Washington, D.C., and New York City, the National Zoo, and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.The following day, the National Gallery of Art was closed.The National Zoo also closed on January 3, 2019.Tourism attendance on the National Mall was affected.On January 5, 2019, acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt directed the diversion of fee revenue defined by the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to be used to fund minimal maintenance activities so as to preserve access to highly visited parks.\n\nAccording to a January 12, 2019, article in The Economist, on January 11, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was unable to pay its workers who had not been paid since December 22; 55% more of them called in sick than in January 2018.\n\nAs the air traffic controllers were deemed essential employees, they were required to work without pay.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents air traffic controllers, filed a lawsuit against the federal government for the shutdown on January 11, 2019, claiming that requiring 16,000 air traffic controllers to work without being paid violated their constitutional rights and federal minimum wage law.That was the third lawsuit filed against the federal government since the beginning of the shutdown.\n\nAirline and aircraft safety inspectors, on the other hand, were deemed nonessential and furloughed.A news report on January 12, 2019, stated that the Federal Aviation Administration had returned 500 furloughed safety inspectors back to work and would return more to work in the following weeks.As the airline and aircraft safety inspectors were furloughed, the certification process of the Airbus A220 in the US was stalled.Delta Air Lines was forced to delay the launch of the new aircraft, and to use other models of aircraft to serve those routes that was supposed to be served with A220.Many TSA employees also called out sick, most of them because they were trying to find other jobs that would provide immediate paychecks.\n\nThe shutdown initially prevented the National Transportation Safety Board from assisting the Mexican government\'s investigation of the 2018 Puebla helicopter crash that killed a state governor and senator; an exception allowed the NTSB to assist with the Mexican government in the investigation along with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.The NTSB also had to delay several investigations until the government reopened and only continued investigations into accidents that were considered the most serious.Issues in receiving certification and oversight from the FAA led to a month-long delay in the commencement of passenger service at Paine Field in Everett, Washington.\n\nAs the shutdown continued into its fourth week, the unions representing airline pilots, flight attendants and air traffic controllers issued a statement asserting, ""we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play"" because of the shutdown.\n\nSome airports such as the Philadelphia International Airport, launched food and item donations for federal employees who were affected by the shutdown.Other airports such as the Miami International Airport, and the George Bush International Airport, closed down terminals in order to spread out the TSA workers that were available.\n\nOn January 25, flights destined for LaGuardia Airport in New York were halted to a groundstop by FAA officials due to staffing shortages directly as a result of the shutdown.As a result, several flights to and from neighboring airports in the Northeast, specifically Philadelphia and Newark, suffered significant delays of their own.Soon after that, appropriations passed and the government reopened.\n\nThe shutdown delayed software updates to the Boeing 737 MAX airplane which may have caused the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.\n\nDuring the shutdown, court-appointed private lawyers who represent indigent defendants worked without pay.The Federal Judiciary initially had a goal of sustaining paid operations through January 18, 2019.It said it would run out of money to sustain court operations no earlier than January 25, but perhaps as late as February 1.Failing funding, the Judiciary would operate under the terms of the Antideficiency Act.This Act does not allow federal agencies to expend federal funds before an appropriation, nor to accept any voluntary services.The judiciary had 33,000 employees nationwide.Under the Constitution, Supreme Court Justices, appeals court judges and district judges would continue to be paid.\n\nThe shutdown caused many delays and disruptions in cases.Budgets were watched carefully to be able to pay public defenders, DNA testing, informants, and travel costs to interview victims and witnesses.Staffing issues also brought about concerns and constraints with prisons lacking the staff to safely hold attorney-client visits, and caused a delay in bail hearings.\n\nAgents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed in a report released on January 22, 2019, by the FBI Agents Association, that several different investigations were compromised by the shutdown.The report was called ""Voices from the Field"" and was 72 pages long.FBI agents were unable to pay Confidential Human Sources which risks losing that informant permanently.Some FBI divisions no longer have Spanish-speaking staff on hand and could not work with informants who only speak Spanish.Some agents reported that they did not have the funds to assist in joint operations with local law enforcement.\n\nFederal law enforcement agencies working on Native American land worked without pay through the shutdown.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was forced to cancel a trip to the United States/Mexico border in early January due to the shutdown.DHS was also unable to inspect Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities during the shutdown to ensure that immigrants were being held in facilities appropriately.During the shutdown, the federal government\'s e-Verify system—a system for employers to check the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States—was halted.\n\nDuring the shutdown, a wave of Domain Name System (DNS) attacks on government sites was detected by Homeland Security.The attacks were serious because these Internet sites could be hijacked.\n\nOfficial websites for agencies were rendered insecure or inaccessible through the shutdown, as the expired digital certificates were not renewed.On January 23, DHS asked all government agencies to secure their DNS records; however, many agencies were not able to respond quickly to this request.\n\nExecutive and legislative affairs of the local government of the District of Columbia continued operating through the shutdown, due to a provision previously enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017.The District\'s local court system, including the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, are part of the federal judiciary.Thus, they were partially shut down, preventing District residents from accessing services such as marriage licensing.The District of Columbia government said it would take over trash collection and snow plowing operations for National Park Service facilities in Washington.\n\nThe shutdown also interfered with the response to the 2018 Sunda Strait tsunami, as the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta\'s Twitter account was unable to tweet updates, and the United States Geological Survey was unable to provide data on the tsunami.The American weather model, the GFS, suffered a significant drop in forecast quality when a data format change during the shutdown prevented certain weather data from being recognized by the GFS, and the shutdown prevented the bug from being corrected.\n\nBy mid-day Thursday, January 3, 2019, the FCC had suspended operations.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai canceled his trip to the Consumer Electronics Show.The FTC also suspended certain online operations.The EPA and Department of Energy\'s Energy Star website was not available for the duration of the shutdown.\n\nMakers of alcoholic beverages were unable to receive approval from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau for new labels and recipes during the shutdown.\n\nBased on the recalculation of their operating reserves, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) would have had to cease patent operations in the second week of February.A cadre of personnel was allocated to continue receiving patent applications, receive payments, and maintain the IT infrastructure.Even though the USPTO is self-funded, a Congressional appropriation is required to permit the USPTO to spend money.The pipeline of patent applications at the time took 15.8 months for a response from an examiner.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution shortened to two days and downscaled its scheduled ten-day 2019 Folklife Festival on the National Mall because of the shutdown\'s effects.Sabrina Motley, the director of the festival, said that initially, crucial funding for the June—July event arrived later than expected, slowing preparations.Motley stated: ""The government opened back up, but it took a while for systems to come back online. ...We looked at our production schedule, and it became clear we would need more time than we had.""\n\nThe White House residence staff who stage public receptions were among those furloughed, with a minimal staff continuing to work unpaid for the first family.In the midst of the shutdown Trump invited the Clemson Tigers football team to a White House dinner reception on January 14 in recognition of their College Football Playoff National Championship win.On the morning of the reception Trump announced that he intended to serve fast food hamburgers and pizza to the team, a remark that some commentators interpreted as a joke.That evening Trump welcomed the team in the State Dining Room with a buffet of fast food and pizza from McDonald\'s, Wendy\'s and other restaurant chains, which he stated that he had paid for personally.Trump served fast food to other visiting athletes later that year, after the shutdown had ended.\n\nOn January 10, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with several other unions, announced plans to protest the government shutdown at 1:00pm EST in Washington, DC.Leaders of the National Federation of Federal Employees stated they had hoped that bringing federal workers to the President\'s doorstep would show him that it was the individual workers that the shutdown was hurting the most.President Trump had left to visit the US–Mexican border in Texas earlier in the day.\n\nSimilar protests took place in Philadelphia and St. Louis, among other cities.On January 15, representatives for Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, and Vietnam Veterans of America along with others called for an end to shutdown, but avoided placing any blame on political parties.\n\nShortly after the protests, the American Federation of Government Employees sued the Trump administration to challenge the arrangements for work without pay during the shutdown.A similar suit was raised and won during the 2013 Federal Government shutdown.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association also sued the Trump administration, as the shutdown allegedly violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by failing to pay the workers at least a minimum wage during the shutdown.\n\nAs the salaries for members of Congress are written into permanent law and not funded through annual appropriations, the government shutdown did not affect their salaries.Senators and Representatives were still paid their biweekly salaries of $6,700 towards at least $174,000 a year.\n\nSeveral Democratic and Republican Senators and Representatives said they would donate or refuse their salary during the shutdown.Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw stated that he would refuse his salary, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto indicated she would donate hers to a Nevada charity, Senator Mazie Hirono said she would donate her salary to Hawaii food banks, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would give hers to refugee non-profit HIAS, New York Congressman Max Rose stated that he would give his salary to charity and outgoing Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota pledged hers to charity, along with her Republican colleague John Hoeven.Republican senator Kevin Cramer, who defeated Heidi Heitkamp in the 2018 midterm elections, refused to donate his salary, calling the move ""gimmicky"".Representative Brian Fitzpatrick urged all members of Congress to decline their paychecks.He said, ""If you\'re in Congress, don\'t just delay your pay -- forfeit it, write a check back to the US Treasury.Then you\'ll feel the pain of federal workers.""\n\nBy January 17, 2019, 102 members of Congress—20 Senators and 82 Representatives— chose to decline their paychecks or were donating their paychecks to charity.\n\nDuring the shutdown, many federal workers used food banks and food pantries in order to feed themselves and their families.Many food pantries waived certain restrictions in order to help government workers have access to food.During the shutdown, the Salvation Army Emergency Disasters Services program provided meals for federal workers.Chef Jose Andres created the #ChefsForFeds program to feed federal workers in Washington, D.C. and by January 21, made announcements to expand the program nationwide.\n\nSome states such as California, offered furloughed employees unemployment benefits, although the Trump administration allegedly told states that they could not do so with federal funds.Organizations such as state Attorney Generals offices, and credit card companies posted statements to their websites to offer a means to help to consolidate debt, meet mortgages or other payments such as child support or tuition.An employment law firm offered pro bono legal advice to furloughed federal employees.School districts opened up free or reduced lunch options for children of federal employees, and looked into other options to aid parents amid concerns that financial stress at home would adversely affect families and children.Every mainline denomination in America has contributed to efforts to provide relief.One Baptist church emptied its entire disaster fund to aid federal employees.\n\nOn January 24, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross downplayed the financial difficulties faced by the 800,000 federal workers affected by the shutdown, stating that they should borrow money to ""tide them over"" until the shutdown ends.Critics and Democrats criticized the statement as inappropriate, noting that Ross\' own net worth is estimated at almost $700 million, accusing him of being out of touch with the workers.Ross also said that he ""did not understand"" why people who were not getting paid due to the shutdown were visiting food banks.When asked about Ross\' statement, Trump suggested that grocery stores will ""work along"" with the government by voluntarily extending credit to those who are out of funds to buy food.National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow characterized the shutdown as a ""glitch"" and suggested that federal workers who were required to work without pay were ""volunteering"" to work for their love of the country and ""presumably their allegiance to President Trump.""\n\nIn a video message to staff, FBI director Christopher Wray stated, ""Making some people stay home when they don\'t want to, and making others show up without pay, it\'s mind-boggling, it\'s shortsighted and it\'s unfair.It takes a lot to get me angry, but I\'m about as angry as I\'ve been in a long, long time.""\n\nLara Trump, a daughter-in-law of the President, drew outrage after an interview in which she stated that while ""It\'s not fair to you..."" the shutdown was ""...a little bit of pain, but it\'s going to be for the future of our country, and their children and their grandchildren and generations after them will thank them for their sacrifice right now.""Her comments drew criticism by politicians, celebrities, and the general public who felt the advisor and spokeswoman for the Trump 2020 campaign was out of touch, however Lara Trump later claimed the comments were taken out of context.\n\nIn January 2019, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that 56% of the responding public opposed a wall while 39% favored it, and 45% viewed the situation at the border as a crisis.The numbers were similar to the poll in December 2018 yet a later poll by ABC News showed that as the partial shutdown entered its fourth week support for building a wall was increasing.A poll done through YouGov between December 23–25, 2018, reported that 51% of respondents thought Trump deserved ""a lot"" of the blame, 44% thought congressional Democrats and 39% thought congressional Republicans.Similar results were reported by a December 21–25 survey done by Reuters and Ipsos in which 47% of respondents said that the shutdown was the President\'s fault and 33% blamed Congressional Democrats.\n\nOver the course of the shutdown, Trump\'s approval rating marginally declined while his disapproval rating marginally increased.His net approval rating was by the middle of January 2019 at its lowest point since February 2018.On December 27, 2018, it was reported that Trump\'s approval rating of registered voters was at 39%, with 56% disapproval.Broken down the rating was split across party lines, with Republicans reporting an 80% approval rate while Democrats and independents reported a 90% and 57% disapproval rating, respectively.The poll was conducted through Morning Consult between December 21–23.The poll also reported that 43% of respondents blamed Trump for the shutdown, with 31% blaming congressional Democrats and 7% congressional Republicans.Another poll through The New York Times Upshot/Siena College reported that 89% of voters\' views on Trump and the wall were aligned, suggesting that support for the wall was a function of support for Trump.\n\nThe Washington Post–ABC News poll published on January 13, 2019, found that a larger number of Americans blamed Trump and congressional Republicans than congressional Democrats for the shutdown.A PBS NewsHour–Marist poll found that on January 15, 2019, a majority of Americans thought that President Trump was to blame for the shutdown.A January 2019 poll conducted by telephone for CBS News found that 70% of Americans polled did not want a government shutdown over the issue of building a border wall; 66% believed that Trump should agree to a budget without wall funding.\n\nPresidency of Donald Trump Donald Trump January 2018 United

45,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018–2019 United States federal government shutdown', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The United States federal government shutdown from midnight EST on December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019 (35 days) was the longest government shutdown in history and the second and final federal government shutdown involving furloughs during the presidency of Donald Trump.It occurred when the 115th Congress and Trump could not agree on an appropriations bill to fund the operations of the federal government for the 2019 fiscal year, or a temporary continuing resolution that would extend the deadline for passing a bill.The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal departments or agencies from conducting non-essential operations without appropriations legislation in place.As a result, nine executive departments with around 800,000 employees had to shut down partially or in full, affecting about one-fourth of government activities and causing employees to be furloughed or required to work without being paid.The Congressional Budget Office estimated the shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion USD, excluding indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.\n\nThe shutdown stemmed from an impasse over Trump\'s demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall.In December 2018, the Senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the bill appeared likely to be approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Trump.After Trump faced heavy criticism from some right-wing media outlets and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to ""build the wall"", he announced that he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund its construction.As a result, the House passed a stopgap bill with funding for the wall, but it was blocked in the Senate by the threat of a Democratic filibuster.\n\nIn January 2019, representatives elected in the November 2018 election took office, giving the Democrats a majority in the House.The House immediately voted to approve the appropriations bill that had previously passed the Senate unanimously (which included no funding for the wall).For several weeks, Trump continued to maintain that he would veto any bill that did not fund an entire border wall, and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the Senate from considering any appropriations legislation that Trump would not support, including the bill that had previously passed.Democrats and some Republicans opposed the shutdown and passed multiple bills to reopen the government, arguing that the government shutdown amounted to ""hostage-taking"" civil servants and that negotiations could only begin once the government was reopened.\n\nOn January 25, 2019, Trump agreed to endorse a stopgap bill to reopen the government for three weeks up until February 15 to allow for negotiations to take place to approve an appropriations bill that both parties could agree on.However, Trump reiterated his demand for the border wall funding and said that he would shut down the government again or declare a national emergency and use military funding to build the wall if Congress did not appropriate the funds by February 15.\n\nTrump\'s approval rating dropped during the shutdown.A majority of Americans opposed exploitation of the shutdown as a negotiating strategy and held Trump responsible for the shutdown: A CBS News poll found that 71% of Americans considered the border wall ""not worth the shutdown"" and a Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 53% of Americans blamed Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, compared to 34% who blamed Democrats and 10% who blamed both parties.\n\nOn February 15, 2019, Trump declared a national emergency to fund the wall and bypass Congress, after being unsatisfied with a bipartisan border bill that had passed the House and the Senate a day before.\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign, then-candidate Trump promised to build a wall along the Mexico–United States border for which Mexico would pay.The president of Mexico rejected the idea of providing any funding for a U.S. border wall.In 2018, Trump requested $ in federal funding for some of barrier on the border, mostly to replace of aging fence built under the Secure Fence Act of 2006.On December 25, 2018, Trump reversed course, suggesting that he might accept of either mostly refurbished barrier (rather than new barriers in locations that did not previously have them) by November 2020.Trump\'s proposals and public statements on the wall have shifted widely over time, with varied proposals as to the design, material, length, height, and width of a wall.\n\nIn September 2018, Congress passed two ""minibus"" appropriations bills for the 2019 United States federal budget, which began on October 1, 2018.These bills combined five of the 12 regular appropriations bills covering 77% of federal discretionary funding, and included a continuing resolution until December 7 for the remaining agencies.On December 6, Congress passed a second continuing resolution to December 21, to give more time for negotiations on Trump\'s proposed border wall, which had been delayed due to the funeral of George H. W. Bush.\n\nA Senate Homeland Security appropriations bill, negotiated by both parties and reported by the committee to the Senate, provided for $ for border security, including funds for ""approximately 65 miles of pedestrian fencing along the southwest border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector"".The bill did not receive a vote on the Senate floor, although House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer indicated that such a proposal could be acceptable to House Democrats.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said the Democratic Party would not support $ for the border wall.At a press conference before the government shutdown, he noted ""the $1.6 billion for border security negotiated by Democrats and Republicans is our position.We believe that is the right way to go.""\n\nOn December 11, President Trump held a televised meeting with Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in the Oval Office and asked them to support an appropriation of $5.7 billion for funding of a border wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico.They refused, resulting in an argument between Trump and both Congressional leaders.During the contentious discussion, Trump remarked, ""I am proud to shut down the government for border security ...I will be the one to shut [the government] down.I\'m not going to blame you for it ...I will take the mantle.I will be the one to shut it down.""Schumer replied, ""We shouldn\'t shut down the government over a dispute.""Ten days later, Trump blamed Democrats for the impending shutdown.\n\nThree days later, Politico reported that Trump was willing to sign a bill with no funding for a border wall that delayed a government shutdown into 2019 and the new Congress.On December 18, following a meeting with Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the government would not shut down on December 22 and that Trump was ""flexible"" over funding for a border wall.Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby commented that the most likely resolution was a bill that funded the government until early February.Schumer added that his caucus would ""very seriously"" consider such a bill and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said ""I don\'t know anybody on the Hill that wants a shutdown, and I think all the president\'s advisers are telling him this would not be good.""\n\nOn December 19, the Senate passed a second continuing resolution () that would fund the government until February 8, 2019.Pelosi announced that House Democrats would support the measure, meaning it would overcome opposition from conservative Republicans and pass the House.On December 20, following increased criticism from conservative media, pundits, and political figures, Trump reversed his position and declared that he would not sign any funding bill that did not include border wall funding.The same day, the House passed a continuing resolution that included $5 billion for the wall and $8 billion in disaster aid.This bill failed in the Senate.Trump\'s changing position caused consternation among Senate Republicans.\n\nThe shutdown started December 22 and Trump announced that he would cancel his planned trip to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas and stay in Washington, D.C.The meaning of the term ""wall"" was expected to be an aspect of the negotiations.\n\nCongress adjourned on December 22 for the Christmas and holiday season, with many predicting that the shutdown would not be resolved until the start of the 116th Congress.The Senate reconvened on December 27 for four minutes, with Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) presiding over the session.The House briefly reconvened as well, with Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) saying that members should not expect any further votes for the rest of 2018.Representative Jim McGovern (D-MA) went to the House floor to try to force consideration of a short-term funding bill to end the shutdown that the Senate had already passed, but the Republican Speaker-pro-tem refused to let him speak.\n\nCongress then adjourned again until December 31, 2018, for a pro forma session.On January 2, 2019, the last full day of the 115th United States Congress, there was a pro forma session scheduled to last several minutes.\n\nThe new Congress was sworn in on January 3, 2019, and one of the first orders of business in the House after electing the Speaker and swearing in the new members was a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security until February 8 (), which passed by a vote of 239–192; and a package combining five appropriation bills funding the rest of the government for the remainder of the fiscal year (), passed by a vote of 241–190.The bills contained $1.3 billion of funding for border security, but no additional funding for a border wall.\n\nBeginning on January 9, the Democratic-controlled House voted on four appropriations bills individually:\n\nFinancial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Treasury (including the Internal Revenue Service), federal judiciary, District of Columbia, and a number of independent agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, General Services Administration, and Securities and Exchange Commission.The House passed the legislation on January 9, on a 240–188 vote, with every Democrat and eight Republicans voting yes, and all other Republicans voting no. Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Department of Agriculture (including food stamps), the Food and Drug Administration, and related entities.On January 10, the House passed this bill 243–183.Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore Transportation and Housing and Urban Development (including some federal mortgage programs).On January 10, the House passed this bill 244–180.Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Interior Department, Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies, including the Smithsonian Institution.On January 11, ten House Republicans voted with Democrats in a 240–179 vote to end the shutdown of Interior-Environment programs.It was the most recent of a ""series of standalone appropriations measures"" the House sent to the Senate.\n\nThis strategy has been compared to one used by Republicans during the 2013 shutdown in the form of a series of fourteen mini-continuing resolutions.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed that the Senate would not consider the House bills to reopen the government, indicating that Senate Republicans would not support any bill unless it had Trump\'s support.In January 2019, McConnell and Senate Republicans came under increased pressure to break the impasse and reopen the government.Three Republican Senators—Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Cory Gardner of Colorado—called for an end to the shutdown.Senators Collins and Gardner said they supported the House\'s budget bills to end the shutdown.West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito said that she could support ending the shutdown provided border wall talks continued.Pat Roberts of Kansas said that shutdowns ""never work"" and only turned affected federal workers into ""pawns"" and that, although the time had not yet come for Senate Republicans to override any possible Trump veto and end the shutdown, ""we\'re getting pretty close.""Johnny Isakson of Georgia echoed that sentiment, saying that support for McConnell\'s refusal to support bills that do not include funding for a wall would not last indefinitely: ""There\'s a time when that may run out.""\n\nOn January 16, McConnell again blocked the House appropriation bills to reopen the government from being considered on the Senate floor.The following day, McConnell blocked consideration of bills to reopen most of the closed government agencies for a third time.On January 23, McConnell blocked a bill to reopen most of the government for the fourth time.\n\nOn January 22, McConnell stated that the Senate would be voting on two different bills to end the shutdown on January 24.The first vote is on a bill to reopen the government which includes Trump\'s proposal to provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and temporary protections to some immigration classes.The other bill is a three-week continuing resolution to fund 25% of the government through February 8.\n\nOn January 22, Senator Mark Warner introduced a bill to keep the federal government running in the event of future shutdown events.The bill is called the ""Stop Shutdowns Transferring Unnecessary Pain and Inflicting Damage in the Coming Years Act"" or the ""Stop STUPIDITY Act"".\n\nOn January 24, the Senate held two votes on competing Democratic and Republican proposals to end the shutdown.The Democratic proposal was largely similar to the measure that had previously passed the Senate unanimously in the 115th Congress, and then been passed by the Democratic-controlled House in the 116th Congress.It provided funding for the government with no money for the border wall.The Republican proposal incorporated Trump\'s proposal, which would fund a border wall; temporarily extend TPS and DACA for three years, but would substantially narrow eligibility for DACA; and make significant legal changes to make it more difficult for persons escaping violence and persecution to be granted asylum in the United States.Neither proposal was able to attain the 60 votes needed for passage.The Trump plan failed in a 50–47 vote.The Democratic plan failed in a 52–44 vote.Most Republicans voted for Trump\'s plan and against the Democratic plan.Most Democrats voted for the Democratic plan and against Trump\'s plan.Republicans Tom Cotton and Mike Lee voted against both plans.Democrat Joe Manchin and Republicans Lamar Alexander, Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, Johnny Isakson, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney voted for both plans.Not voting on either were Republicans Rand Paul and Jim Risch and Democrat Jacky Rosen.Republican Richard Burr voted for Trump\'s plan and did not vote on the Democratic plan.\n\nOn January 25, House Democrats prepared a compromise proposal to reopen the government, which would provide $5 billion for border security but no wall construction.However, the shutdown ended the same day.\n\nOn January 4, after the new Congress was sworn-in and Pelosi regained the speakership, she and Schumer, as well as congressional Republican leadership met with Trump at the White House.Pelosi and Schumer argued that the shutdown needed to end and reported that Trump refused.They said that Trump threatened to ""keep the government closed for a very long period of time.Months or even years.""Later that day, Trump admitted to ""absolutely"" making that threat, adding, ""I\'m very proud of doing what I\'m doing.""Trump then said that he was considering declaring a national emergency to use military funding for the wall.At the meeting, Trump reprimanded his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney for attempting to propose a compromise between Trump\'s $5.7 billion demand for a border wall and the Democrats\' proposal of $1.3 billion for border security.\n\nTrump addressed the nation from the Oval Office at 9 p.m. EST on January 8, in a nationally televised address broadcast on both network and cable television.In his speech, Trump asserted that there was a ""growing humanitarian and security crisis"" on the Mexico–United States border that could only be solved by appropriating $5.7 billion for construction of a steel wall.Trump did not make any new proposals in his speech to break the impasse.Immediately after Trump\'s speech, Schumer and Pelosi delivered a response on behalf of the Democrats, in which they demanded an end to the shutdown and said: ""President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government.""\n\nTrump met with congressional leadership again on January 9, in a meeting lasting 14 minutes.Trump asked Pelosi, ""Will you agree to my wall?"" and when she replied that she would not, Trump said ""bye-bye"" and walked out of the meeting, later declaring it ""a total waste of time"".Schumer accused Trump of throwing a ""temper tantrum"" and slamming his hands on the table.Trump rebuked Schumer\'s comments on Twitter.Vice President Mike Pence and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that Trump remained calm and never raised his voice.On January 10, Pelosi described the preceding day\'s meeting with Trump as ""a setup"" staged by White House aides so that Trump could walk out of the meeting.Pelosi described Trump as ""un-presidential""; accused him of ""exploiting this situation in a way that enhances his power""; and said: ""I don\'t think he really wants a solution.I think he loves the distraction.""\n\nAfter Trump walked out of the January 9 meeting with congressional Democratic leaders, no further negotiations were conducted.Several Republican senators met in the office of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, after the meeting to discuss a compromise to end the shutdown.They discussed agreeing to Trump\'s demand for border wall funding and offering the Democrats help for Dreamers, refugee protections and extensions to H-2B visas.On January 13, Graham proposed that Trump agree to a congressional vote to reopen the government pending the resumption of negotiations.Graham suggested that if Trump and congressional Democrats did not come to an agreement at that time, Trump could declare a national emergency.Trump rejected this proposal the next day.\n\nOn January 19, Trump proposed a temporary extension of the two programs that protect about 700,000 immigrants from deportation—Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)—in exchange for funding for the border wall.The protections would be temporary, with no path to citizenship.Trump had previously revoked TPS for people from a number of Latin American and African countries, and taken steps to rescind DACA.In his remarks at the White House, Trump referred to a ""barrier"" rather than a ""wall"" and indicated that he aimed to erect ""steel barriers in high priority locations"" rather than ""a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea.""\n\nIn addition to funding a border wall, the 1,300-page Republican bill released after Trump made his proposal would make major changes to U.S. immigration policy (which were not included in Trump\'s public announcement).The legislation would severely restrict the ability of children from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to apply for asylum in the United States.Specifically, participation in the Central American Minors Program would be subject to an annual cap and migrant children would be barred from applying for asylum in person at the border, and only migrant children with a ""qualified"" parent in the U.S. would be eligible to apply.The bill would also create a new, more burdensome application process for TPS holders, and would exclude TPS holders from Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen.The American Immigration Lawyers Association government relations director said that the proposal ""would categorically block tens of thousands of children from ever applying for asylum,"" while a Cato Institute immigration analyst wrote that the proposal would not extend DACA, but rather replace it with ""a totally different program that will exclude untold thousands of Dreamers who would have been eligible under DACA.""\n\nDemocrats rejected Trump\'s proposal.In a speech on the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""The president\'s proposal is one-sided, harshly partisan and was made in bad faith.The asylum changes are a poison pill, if there ever was one.""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said extending the DACA proposal temporarily was ""unacceptable"" and a ""non-starter"" because it did not ""represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people\'s lives.""Analysts pointed out that Trump had previously rejected a deal that would have provided funding for the border wall in exchange for further protection for DACA recipients.Conversely, Republicans reacted positively to Trump\'s proposal, and Mitch McConnell said he would bring it to a vote in the Senate.\n\nDuring the shutdown, on January 8 in a press conference, a reporter asked Trump if he was considering declaring a national emergency, to which Trump replied, ""I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want"" and suggested that he could declare an emergency.After this, Trump repeatedly threatened to declare a national emergency to unilaterally order wall construction without congressional authorization.Some of Trump\'s advisors, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, reportedly attempted to dissuade him from doing so.Administration officials considered diverting hurricane-relief and wildfire-relief funds from a $13.9 billion February 2018 emergency supplemental appropriations bill (for disaster relief in Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California, among other places) in order to fund a wall, and directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to look into this possibility.\n\nAn attempt by Trump to invoke emergency powers would almost certainly have prompted a lengthy legal challenge in court.Democrats responded that Trump lacked the authority to declare a national emergency; Representative Adam Schiff called it a ""non-starter"" and said that ""if Harry Truman couldn\'t nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this President doesn\'t have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion dollar wall on the border.""Democratic Representative Nydia Velázquez said the notion of redirecting disaster-relief funds to a border wall was ""beyond appalling"".Presidents have declared emergencies in the past, but none has ""involved funding a policy goal after failing to win congressional approval"".Yale Law School professor Bruce Ackerman wrote that the declaration of a national emergency to build a wall as Trump suggested would be unconstitutional and illegal.Other scholars, such as Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice, believed that Trump could make a colorable argument that diverting military-construction appropriations for border-wall construction was legal, but that doing so would be an abuse of power.Law professor Ilya Somin stated that in the unlikely case that Trump succeeded in using the emergency powers in this way, it would set a dangerous precedent, which Republicans would come to regret next time the president was a Democrat.\n\nOn January 11, Trump—while maintaining he has the authority to do so anytime—said he was not in any rush to declare a national emergency to secure wall funding, saying he would rather see Congress ""do its job"" and that the Democrats ""should come back and vote.""The next day he again threatened to use emergency powers if Democrats did not ""come to their senses.""\n\nOn January 16, Pelosi sent a letter to Trump that indicated the House would be unavailable for the 2019 State of the Union Address that was scheduled for January 29.Pelosi wrote, ""Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government reopens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has reopened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on Jan. 29.""The delivery of the State of the Union address had been delayed or substantially changed on only two occasions since 1913.In a letter sent to the Speaker the next day, Trump said she would not be allowed to take military transport aircraft on scheduled visits to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan.Trump replied, ""We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the shutdown is over.""Pelosi and a congressional delegation had planned on visiting overseas American military personnel.\n\nOn January 23, Trump sent a letter to Pelosi insisting that there were no security concerns and that he would hold the State of the Union Address as scheduled.Trump wrote, ""Therefore, I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and Congress of the United States of America regarding the State of our Union.""In a letter sent in reply, Pelosi stated that the House would not consider a concurrent resolution to authorize the State of the Union Address in the House Chamber until the shutdown ended, writing, ""Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened.""\n\nTrump later stated he would look for an alternative, but then retracted that statement in a pair of tweets announcing that he would wait until the end of the shutdown to give the address in the House Chamber.\n\nOn January 25, Trump announced his support for a three-week funding measure that would reopen the government until February 15.The deal, which also moved forward with long-term Department of Homeland Security funding, did not include funds for a wall.As expected, the agreement provided federal employees with back pay.Both the Senate and House of Representatives passed the funding measure by voice vote, sending the resolution to the President\'s desk.Trump signed the bill the same day, ending the shutdown.\n\nLater in January, Republican senators voted unanimously against a bill to provide back pay to federal contractors.\n\nWithout legislation enacted by February 15, a new partial shutdown would have begun, three weeks after the last ended.A bipartisan group of senators and representatives reached an agreement ""in principle"" on February 11, but Trump did not say whether he would sign it.Included was $1.375 billion for 55 miles of steel border fencing.On February 13, it was reported that, against the wishes of Democratic leaders and many Republicans, Trump was blocking the provision of back pay to federal contractors who were still out of pocket from the shutdown.Both houses passed the bill February 14 with enough votes to override a veto if that happened.\n\nOn February 15, at the White House Rose Garden, Trump announced that he had signed the spending bill to keep the government open.He also declared a national emergency, hoping to get access to $8 billion to use for border security.\n\nAgencies funded by two ""minibus"" appropriations bills passed in September 2018 were not affected by the shutdown.About 380,000 federal employees were furloughed, and an additional 420,000 employees for the affected agencies were expected to work with their pay delayed until the end of the shutdown, totaling 800,000 workers affected out of 2.1 million civilian non-postal federal employees.As only about a quarter of the government was shut down, many people who are not federal employees did not fully realize the effects of the shutdown.\n\nAccording to and , these were the affected agencies:\n\nDepartment of State Department of the Treasury Department of Justice Most of the Department of the Interior Department of Agriculture Department of Commerce Department of Housing and Urban Development Department of Transportation Department of Homeland Security Some Department of Health and Human Services agencies Food and Drug Administration Indian Health Service Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Superfund Research Program Executive Office of the President Most independent agencies Judicial Branch\n\nUnaffected agencies include, according to and :\n\nDepartment of Defense Department of Labor Most of the Department of Health and Human Services Department of Energy Department of Education Department of Veterans Affairs Some Department of the Interior agencies Bureau of Reclamation Central Utah Project District of Columbia (excluding courts) Legislative Branch Social Security Administration Nuclear Regulatory Commission Appalachian Regional Commission Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board Delta Regional Authority Denali Commission Northern Border Regional Commission Southeast Crescent Regional Commission Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board American Battle Monuments Commission U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Cemeterial Expenses of the Army, including Arlington National Cemetery and Soldiers\' and Airmen\'s Home National Cemetery Armed Forces Retirement Home Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System Fund Intelligence Community Management Account Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled Corporation for National and Community Service Corporation for Public Broadcasting Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission Institute of Museum and Library Services Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission Medicare Payment Advisory Commission National Council on Disability National Labor Relations Board National Mediation Board Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission Railroad Retirement Board\n\nJobs affected included staff throughout the United States, not just DC area employees.FBI agents, federal corrections officers, FDA inspectors, NASA employees, TSA staff, Border Patrol staff and CBP officers, census staff, National Park Service staff, members of the Coast Guard, and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers either worked without pay or were furloughed, with increasing numbers of unpaid essential employees failing to show up for work.\n\nOn January 11, 800,000 workers for agencies shutdown or furloughed missed their first paycheck.Federal workers normally receive pay on federal holidays, which include Christmas, New Year\'s Day and potentially Martin Luther King Jr. Day.The shutdown affected the employees\' entitlement to paid holidays due to the shutdown.Unemployment assistance to federal workers furloughed under the government shutdown varied by locality.Only non-reporting workers were eligible for assistance, whereas furloughed workers who still reported to work were not.Workers who received unemployment assistance were required pay it back after the shut down ended and they received backpay.Some furloughed workers sought other employment opportunities while they were idled.However, external employment must meet agency-specific ethics guidelines, and mandatory reviews of external employment were also curtailed as most ethics officials were also furloughed.Federal employees were not able to use vacation or sick leave during the shutdown so scheduled holiday vacation time either became unpaid if the worker was deemed non-essential or was cancelled if the worker was deemed essential.In many cases unused leave over a certain threshold expired at year-end, but employees who had leave scheduled in advance of the shutdown did not have ""use or lose"" leave balances deducted from their accrued leave.Many furloughed employees took to crowd-funding campaigns to raise cash to replace missed paychecks, but these types of solicitations also run afoul of government ethics rules.\n\nAs furloughed federal workers and their families shared stories of their hardships, such as not being able to meet rent or mortgage payments and missed bills, the hashtag ""#ShutdownStories"" went viral on social media.The federal government\'s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) responded by publishing sample letters that employees could send to their creditors.One read, in part, ""I am a Federal employee who has recently been furloughed due to a lack of funding of my agency.Because of this, my income has been severely cut and I am unable to pay the entire cost of my mortgage, along with my other expenses.""Other federal workers reached out to other news outlets to share stories about having to stretch their budgets and the impact of the shutdown on their families.In addition to being unable to meet rent or pay bills, many federal workers around the country were unable to pay for groceries and turned to food banks.One federal prison guard in Louisiana attempted suicide after posting about the financial pressures of the shutdown on Facebook.\n\nThe OPM also suggested that employees who had landlords write: ""I would like to discuss with you the possibility of trading my services to perform maintenance (e.g. painting, carpentry work) in exchange for partial rent payments"" and suggested those who lacked funds to pay bills should hire personal attorneys to assist them.Other organizations also posted advice on how to ""find supplemental income""; the Coast Guard suggested that Coast Guard members ""have a garage sale, offer to watch children, walk pets or house sit"" while furloughed.\n\nOn January 4, The Washington Post reported that because the shutdown was triggered by the failure to enact spending bills that continued a federal government pay freeze, hundreds of senior Trump administration political appointees would receive a roughly $10,000 pay raise the following day.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the pending pay raise was an ""unnecessary byproduct of the shutdown.""\n\nOn January 10, the Senate approved by unanimous consent a bill (S.24, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019) providing that furloughed federal employees would receive back pay for the period of the furlough once appropriations were restored; the bill was approved the next day by the House on a vote of 411–7.Trump signed the bill into law on January 16.\n\nNative American tribes were not paid for treaties negotiated with the United States government.These treaties specified that the federal government must provide funding for health clinics, employee salaries, education, infrastructure and other services, which were not paid during the shutdown.Native lands are ""owned, managed and maintained by the federal government.""Native Americans who receive a per capita check for profits from oil and gas sales from tribal land did not receive check for the month of February.Roads were not plowed on tribal land, and some areas received significant snowfall.This caused people of the Navajo Nation to become trapped inside their homes.Food services, which fed 90,000 Native Americans in 2017, were halted.\n\nNative American communities had a high percentage of individuals who worked for the federal government and lost income during the shutdown.In North and South Dakota, one of the largest employers is the Indian Health Service.The Chippewa tribe reported an economic loss of nearly $100,000 daily in funds that the federal government was supposed to provide as a treaty obligation.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was closed for the shutdown.However, 60 percent of the Indian Health Service (IHS) continued to work without pay.IHS provides care for 2.2 million Native Americans and on January 23, began to deny care that was not considered ""life threatening.""The Bureau of Indian Education was able to stay open because it was funded on a different schedule.Unlike other government shutdowns, there was little outreach from the Trump Administration to Native Americans and the Chippewa tribe in Michigan was given a 24-hour notice that the shutdown would take place and affect the tribe.\n\nThe only military branch that was affected by the shutdown was the Coast Guard because it was part of the Department of Homeland Security, while the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps were all funded through the Department of Defense.Officials were able to fund payment on December 31, 2018, but were not able to do so for the paychecks of January 15 and 30, 2019, along with the pay and benefits for civilian workers and retirees.During the shutdown, the Coast Guard continued to engage in patrolling the American coastline and carrying out overseas missions in locations such as the Persian Gulf along with the Navy and in the Caribbean.Other issues arose in the payment processes for Coast Guard members Tricare Health and Dental Program payments, although the individuals were still covered.\n\nMilitary schools, such as the Coast Guard Academy and the National War College, lost funding due to the shutdown and the schools had to work to find funds to pay professors.\n\nAlthough the Department of Defense was not shut down, the February 4, 2019, date for release of the Pentagon\'s 2020 budget was delayed by at least one month.This had repercussions on the interim period which is usually used by Pentagon planners for adjustments before the 2020 fiscal year which will begin in October 2019.The White House Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the Pentagon request, was shut down when the Pentagon budget arrived in December, and remained inactive, so no work was done on the budget.\n\nOn February 25, 2019, the Pentagon\'s counter-drug (interdiction) funding has up to $85 million not yet obligated, but that money was planned for the known corridors in El Paso, Tucson, Yuma, and El Centro for border fencing, lighting, and road projects, so any funds which might possibly be intended for additional projects elsewhere along the border must be obligated by September 30, 2019, in order not to affect the known corridors.Otherwise appropriations above the $85 million not yet obligated for additional interdiction border projects will have to be approved by additional Congressional appropriations, to reach the $2 billion target.\n\nA January 28, 2019 Congressional Budget Office report estimated that the 35-day partial government shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion, including $3 billion in permanent losses; the CBO estimate excluded indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.The furloughing of 145,000 federal workers and 112,500 federal contractors in the Washington Metropolitan Area cost the regional economy $119 million each day, or 7.3% of the region\'s total output.That reduced GDP by over $2.8 billion in the Washington DC area alone.The shutdown also had a noticeable impact on hunger in the national capital region: food pantries in Washington DC and Northern Virginia reported an increase of around 10% in the number of people coming to pick up groceries, with most of that increase coming from federal workers and contractors.\n\nFitch Ratings warned that an extended shutdown might lead to a downgrade in the U.S.\'s Triple-A credit rating if lawmakers were unable to pass a budget or manage the debt ceiling.That in turn would make borrowing more costly for companies and American households, because it is the benchmark for many other lines of credit.The only time the U.S. credit rating has been downgraded by S&P was during the United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011.\n\nSome economists believed that an extended shutdown would weaken consumer confidence and heighten the risk of pushing the U.S. economy into a recession.Between 800,000 federal government employees and some 4 million federal contractors, the shutdown directly affected nearly 3% of the labor force of the United States; in a typical recession, unemployment increases 2–4%.The reduction in spending by those households combined with the reduction of government services could have macroeconomic results similar to a typical recession.The shutdown had an adverse effect on the budgets of state and local governments, as states covered some federal services (particularly the most vulnerable) during the shutdown.\n\nBy mid-January 2019, the White House Council of Economic Advisors estimated that each week of the shutdown reduced GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, the equivalent of 1.2 points per quarter.CEA chairman Kevin Hassett later acknowledged that GDP growth could decline to zero in the first quarter of 2019 if the shutdown lasted the entire quarter.\n\nAs tax season began in the United States on January 28, some 46,000 Internal Revenue Service workers were called back to work to ensure tax refunds and returns were not affected by the shutdown.The recalled workers allowed the department to continue operations that were automatic and those deemed necessary for the safety of human life or protection of government property, such as processing electronic returns, returns with payments, mailing tax forms, appeals, criminal law enforcement investigations and technical support.\n\nDuring the shutdown, 95% of federal staff for the USDA\'s Food and Nutrition Services were furloughed.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the food-stamp program, could be funded through a $3 billion contingency fund appropriated by Congress in 2018; if the shutdown had continued through March 2019, those funds would have been exhausted, leaving some 38 million Americans without food stamps and endangering food security.Concerns were raised that continuation of the shutdown could delay the issuance of some $140 billion in tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees most of the food supply in the U.S.In early January, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner, reported that the FDA suspended food inspections.He noted that inspection of foreign food was continuing as ""almost normal,"" because they are considered vital.Around January 14, ""high-risk"" food inspections resumed.As of January 22, 2019, 46 percent of the FDA were working, though 20 percent of them were working without pay.During the shutdown, two new recalls for contamination with Listeria or Salmonella took place.Consumer advocacy groups advised of food safety issues during the shutdown.Food safety attorney, Bill Marler, advocated against eating ""fresh, uncooked products on the market place.""Because there was a shortage of FDA inspectors, many imported perishable items, such as produce or flowers, were at risk of spoilage.Meat and some egg products are inspected by the USDA\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service.Federal legislation required those inspectors to remain working without pay.\n\nSchool administrations raised concern about how to feed children who purchase food at the schools for lunch, as funding concerns caused some districts to conserve food and funding.Many limited the amount or variation of foods available for the children to purchase, and alerted parents to the concerns and the limited availability of some of the items.Most schools affected were in high-poverty areas, and depended on federally funded lunch programs, such as the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) a federal grant established by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 and operated through the Department of Agriculture.Some 22 million students in nearly 100,000 schools received school meals through that operation.\n\nAs with the January 2018 shutdown, national parks were expected to be open to the extent practical, though there would be no staff and buildings would be closed.The shutdown affected national parks unevenly, some were accessible with bare-bones staffing levels, some operated with money from states or charitable groups, and others were locked off.Diane Regas, president and chief executive of the Trust for Public Land, called upon Trump to close all national parks to protect the public: by the third week of the shutdown, three people had died in national parks.This number was reported as being within \'usual\' levels.At Yosemite National Park, on January 4, 2019, a death from a fall went unreported for a week.\n\nBy January 1, 2019, the problems of neglected trash pileup, overflowing public toilets, and access to first aid were repeated across the Park system.Health and safety concerns were raised, with concerns by scientists that the expansive amount of garbage and human waste could impact water and soil quality, or cause damage to animals in the parks.Other issues that arose due to the shutdown included illegal campsites, protected agriculture being damaged, damaging of government property and trespassing on foot and by vehicle.\n\nNew York kept the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open, as it did during the January 2018 shutdown.Arizona and Utah were able to keep Grand Canyon National Park, Zion National Park, Arches National Park, and Bryce Canyon National Park open and provided services including public restrooms, shuttles and trash collection.Utah\'s funding included visitor centers.The sites closed outright in the southwest alone included Bandelier National Monument and Valles Caldera National Preserve in northern New Mexico, White Sands National Monument in southern New Mexico, Petrified Forest National Park in northern Arizona and Casa Grande Ruins National Monument in south-central Arizona.Access to major parts of Sequoia and Kings Canyon parks were closed, and at Joshua Tree National Park, the administration policy of leaving parks open to visitors despite the staff furloughs resulted in park damage, including the toppling of protected trees.In Texas, Big Bend National Park had no visitor services, such as restrooms.Some trailheads were closed.Regulations continued to be enforced, as the park remained open.Visitors were reminded to remove their own trash and toilet paper.The Alamo remained open but no NPS services were available at the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park.Channel Islands National Park remained open to public access, although services normally provided by the national park service were instead provided by Island Packers Cruises, the company normally in charge of ferries to the islands.\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration closed immediately on December 22, 2018.The Library of Congress, the U.S. Botanic Garden, the Capitol Visitor Center, and the U.S. Capitol Building remained open as they were funded by the 2019 Legislative Branch appropriations bill.The Smithsonian Institution operated on ""prior-year funds"" through January 1, 2019.On January 2, 2019, the Smithsonian Institution initiated an orderly shutdown of all its facilities, including 19 museums in Washington, D.C., and New York City, the National Zoo, and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.The following day, the National Gallery of Art was closed.The National Zoo also closed on January 3, 2019.Tourism attendance on the National Mall was affected.On January 5, 2019, acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt directed the diversion of fee revenue defined by the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to be used to fund minimal maintenance activities so as to preserve access to highly visited parks.\n\nAccording to a January 12, 2019, article in The Economist, on January 11, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was unable to pay its workers who had not been paid since December 22; 55% more of them called in sick than in January 2018.\n\nAs the air traffic controllers were deemed essential employees, they were required to work without pay.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents air traffic controllers, filed a lawsuit against the federal government for the shutdown on January 11, 2019, claiming that requiring 16,000 air traffic controllers to work without being paid violated their constitutional rights and federal minimum wage law.That was the third lawsuit filed against the federal government since the beginning of the shutdown.\n\nAirline and aircraft safety inspectors, on the other hand, were deemed nonessential and furloughed.A news report on January 12, 2019, stated that the Federal Aviation Administration had returned 500 furloughed safety inspectors back to work and would return more to work in the following weeks.As the airline and aircraft safety inspectors were furloughed, the certification process of the Airbus A220 in the US was stalled.Delta Air Lines was forced to delay the launch of the new aircraft, and to use other models of aircraft to serve those routes that was supposed to be served with A220.Many TSA employees also called out sick, most of them because they were trying to find other jobs that would provide immediate paychecks.\n\nThe shutdown initially prevented the National Transportation Safety Board from assisting the Mexican government\'s investigation of the 2018 Puebla helicopter crash that killed a state governor and senator; an exception allowed the NTSB to assist with the Mexican government in the investigation along with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.The NTSB also had to delay several investigations until the government reopened and only continued investigations into accidents that were considered the most serious.Issues in receiving certification and oversight from the FAA led to a month-long delay in the commencement of passenger service at Paine Field in Everett, Washington.\n\nAs the shutdown continued into its fourth week, the unions representing airline pilots, flight attendants and air traffic controllers issued a statement asserting, ""we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play"" because of the shutdown.\n\nSome airports such as the Philadelphia International Airport, launched food and item donations for federal employees who were affected by the shutdown.Other airports such as the Miami International Airport, and the George Bush International Airport, closed down terminals in order to spread out the TSA workers that were available.\n\nOn January 25, flights destined for LaGuardia Airport in New York were halted to a groundstop by FAA officials due to staffing shortages directly as a result of the shutdown.As a result, several flights to and from neighboring airports in the Northeast, specifically Philadelphia and Newark, suffered significant delays of their own.Soon after that, appropriations passed and the government reopened.\n\nThe shutdown delayed software updates to the Boeing 737 MAX airplane which may have caused the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.\n\nDuring the shutdown, court-appointed private lawyers who represent indigent defendants worked without pay.The Federal Judiciary initially had a goal of sustaining paid operations through January 18, 2019.It said it would run out of money to sustain court operations no earlier than January 25, but perhaps as late as February 1.Failing funding, the Judiciary would operate under the terms of the Antideficiency Act.This Act does not allow federal agencies to expend federal funds before an appropriation, nor to accept any voluntary services.The judiciary had 33,000 employees nationwide.Under the Constitution, Supreme Court Justices, appeals court judges and district judges would continue to be paid.\n\nThe shutdown caused many delays and disruptions in cases.Budgets were watched carefully to be able to pay public defenders, DNA testing, informants, and travel costs to interview victims and witnesses.Staffing issues also brought about concerns and constraints with prisons lacking the staff to safely hold attorney-client visits, and caused a delay in bail hearings.\n\nAgents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed in a report released on January 22, 2019, by the FBI Agents Association, that several different investigations were compromised by the shutdown.The report was called ""Voices from the Field"" and was 72 pages long.FBI agents were unable to pay Confidential Human Sources which risks losing that informant permanently.Some FBI divisions no longer have Spanish-speaking staff on hand and could not work with informants who only speak Spanish.Some agents reported that they did not have the funds to assist in joint operations with local law enforcement.\n\nFederal law enforcement agencies working on Native American land worked without pay through the shutdown.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was forced to cancel a trip to the United States/Mexico border in early January due to the shutdown.DHS was also unable to inspect Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities during the shutdown to ensure that immigrants were being held in facilities appropriately.During the shutdown, the federal government\'s e-Verify system—a system for employers to check the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States—was halted.\n\nDuring the shutdown, a wave of Domain Name System (DNS) attacks on government sites was detected by Homeland Security.The attacks were serious because these Internet sites could be hijacked.\n\nOfficial websites for agencies were rendered insecure or inaccessible through the shutdown, as the expired digital certificates were not renewed.On January 23, DHS asked all government agencies to secure their DNS records; however, many agencies were not able to respond quickly to this request.\n\nExecutive and legislative affairs of the local government of the District of Columbia continued operating through the shutdown, due to a provision previously enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017.The District\'s local court system, including the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, are part of the federal judiciary.Thus, they were partially shut down, preventing District residents from accessing services such as marriage licensing.The District of Columbia government said it would take over trash collection and snow plowing operations for National Park Service facilities in Washington.\n\nThe shutdown also interfered with the response to the 2018 Sunda Strait tsunami, as the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta\'s Twitter account was unable to tweet updates, and the United States Geological Survey was unable to provide data on the tsunami.The American weather model, the GFS, suffered a significant drop in forecast quality when a data format change during the shutdown prevented certain weather data from being recognized by the GFS, and the shutdown prevented the bug from being corrected.\n\nBy mid-day Thursday, January 3, 2019, the FCC had suspended operations.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai canceled his trip to the Consumer Electronics Show.The FTC also suspended certain online operations.The EPA and Department of Energy\'s Energy Star website was not available for the duration of the shutdown.\n\nMakers of alcoholic beverages were unable to receive approval from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau for new labels and recipes during the shutdown.\n\nBased on the recalculation of their operating reserves, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) would have had to cease patent operations in the second week of February.A cadre of personnel was allocated to continue receiving patent applications, receive payments, and maintain the IT infrastructure.Even though the USPTO is self-funded, a Congressional appropriation is required to permit the USPTO to spend money.The pipeline of patent applications at the time took 15.8 months for a response from an examiner.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution shortened to two days and downscaled its scheduled ten-day 2019 Folklife Festival on the National Mall because of the shutdown\'s effects.Sabrina Motley, the director of the festival, said that initially, crucial funding for the June—July event arrived later than expected, slowing preparations.Motley stated: ""The government opened back up, but it took a while for systems to come back online. ...We looked at our production schedule, and it became clear we would need more time than we had.""\n\nThe White House residence staff who stage public receptions were among those furloughed, with a minimal staff continuing to work unpaid for the first family.In the midst of the shutdown Trump invited the Clemson Tigers football team to a White House dinner reception on January 14 in recognition of their College Football Playoff National Championship win.On the morning of the reception Trump announced that he intended to serve fast food hamburgers and pizza to the team, a remark that some commentators interpreted as a joke.That evening Trump welcomed the team in the State Dining Room with a buffet of fast food and pizza from McDonald\'s, Wendy\'s and other restaurant chains, which he stated that he had paid for personally.Trump served fast food to other visiting athletes later that year, after the shutdown had ended.\n\nOn January 10, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with several other unions, announced plans to protest the government shutdown at 1:00pm EST in Washington, DC.Leaders of the National Federation of Federal Employees stated they had hoped that bringing federal workers to the President\'s doorstep would show him that it was the individual workers that the shutdown was hurting the most.President Trump had left to visit the US–Mexican border in Texas earlier in the day.\n\nSimilar protests took place in Philadelphia and St. Louis, among other cities.On January 15, representatives for Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, and Vietnam Veterans of America along with others called for an end to shutdown, but avoided placing any blame on political parties.\n\nShortly after the protests, the American Federation of Government Employees sued the Trump administration to challenge the arrangements for work without pay during the shutdown.A similar suit was raised and won during the 2013 Federal Government shutdown.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association also sued the Trump administration, as the shutdown allegedly violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by failing to pay the workers at least a minimum wage during the shutdown.\n\nAs the salaries for members of Congress are written into permanent law and not funded through annual appropriations, the government shutdown did not affect their salaries.Senators and Representatives were still paid their biweekly salaries of $6,700 towards at least $174,000 a year.\n\nSeveral Democratic and Republican Senators and Representatives said they would donate or refuse their salary during the shutdown.Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw stated that he would refuse his salary, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto indicated she would donate hers to a Nevada charity, Senator Mazie Hirono said she would donate her salary to Hawaii food banks, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would give hers to refugee non-profit HIAS, New York Congressman Max Rose stated that he would give his salary to charity and outgoing Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota pledged hers to charity, along with her Republican colleague John Hoeven.Republican senator Kevin Cramer, who defeated Heidi Heitkamp in the 2018 midterm elections, refused to donate his salary, calling the move ""gimmicky"".Representative Brian Fitzpatrick urged all members of Congress to decline their paychecks.He said, ""If you\'re in Congress, don\'t just delay your pay -- forfeit it, write a check back to the US Treasury.Then you\'ll feel the pain of federal workers.""\n\nBy January 17, 2019, 102 members of Congress—20 Senators and 82 Representatives— chose to decline their paychecks or were donating their paychecks to charity.\n\nDuring the shutdown, many federal workers used food banks and food pantries in order to feed themselves and their families.Many food pantries waived certain restrictions in order to help government workers have access to food.During the shutdown, the Salvation Army Emergency Disasters Services program provided meals for federal workers.Chef Jose Andres created the #ChefsForFeds program to feed federal workers in Washington, D.C. and by January 21, made announcements to expand the program nationwide.\n\nSome states such as California, offered furloughed employees unemployment benefits, although the Trump administration allegedly told states that they could not do so with federal funds.Organizations such as state Attorney Generals offices, and credit card companies posted statements to their websites to offer a means to help to consolidate debt, meet mortgages or other payments such as child support or tuition.An employment law firm offered pro bono legal advice to furloughed federal employees.School districts opened up free or reduced lunch options for children of federal employees, and looked into other options to aid parents amid concerns that financial stress at home would adversely affect families and children.Every mainline denomination in America has contributed to efforts to provide relief.One Baptist church emptied its entire disaster fund to aid federal employees.\n\nOn January 24, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross downplayed the financial difficulties faced by the 800,000 federal workers affected by the shutdown, stating that they should borrow money to ""tide them over"" until the shutdown ends.Critics and Democrats criticized the statement as inappropriate, noting that Ross\' own net worth is estimated at almost $700 million, accusing him of being out of touch with the workers.Ross also said that he ""did not understand"" why people who were not getting paid due to the shutdown were visiting food banks.When asked about Ross\' statement, Trump suggested that grocery stores will ""work along"" with the government by voluntarily extending credit to those who are out of funds to buy food.National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow characterized the shutdown as a ""glitch"" and suggested that federal workers who were required to work without pay were ""volunteering"" to work for their love of the country and ""presumably their allegiance to President Trump.""\n\nIn a video message to staff, FBI director Christopher Wray stated, ""Making some people stay home when they don\'t want to, and making others show up without pay, it\'s mind-boggling, it\'s shortsighted and it\'s unfair.It takes a lot to get me angry, but I\'m about as angry as I\'ve been in a long, long time.""\n\nLara Trump, a daughter-in-law of the President, drew outrage after an interview in which she stated that while ""It\'s not fair to you..."" the shutdown was ""...a little bit of pain, but it\'s going to be for the future of our country, and their children and their grandchildren and generations after them will thank them for their sacrifice right now.""Her comments drew criticism by politicians, celebrities, and the general public who felt the advisor and spokeswoman for the Trump 2020 campaign was out of touch, however Lara Trump later claimed the comments were taken out of context.\n\nIn January 2019, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that 56% of the responding public opposed a wall while 39% favored it, and 45% viewed the situation at the border as a crisis.The numbers were similar to the poll in December 2018 yet a later poll by ABC News showed that as the partial shutdown entered its fourth week support for building a wall was increasing.A poll done through YouGov between December 23–25, 2018, reported that 51% of respondents thought Trump deserved ""a lot"" of the blame, 44% thought congressional Democrats and 39% thought congressional Republicans.Similar results were reported by a December 21–25 survey done by Reuters and Ipsos in which 47% of respondents said that the shutdown was the President\'s fault and 33% blamed Congressional Democrats.\n\nOver the course of the shutdown, Trump\'s approval rating marginally declined while his disapproval rating marginally increased.His net approval rating was by the middle of January 2019 at its lowest point since February 2018.On December 27, 2018, it was reported that Trump\'s approval rating of registered voters was at 39%, with 56% disapproval.Broken down the rating was split across party lines, with Republicans reporting an 80% approval rate while Democrats and independents reported a 90% and 57% disapproval rating, respectively.The poll was conducted through Morning Consult between December 21–23.The poll also reported that 43% of respondents blamed Trump for the shutdown, with 31% blaming congressional Democrats and 7% congressional Republicans.Another poll through The New York Times Upshot/Siena College reported that 89% of voters\' views on Trump and the wall were aligned, suggesting that support for the wall was a function of support for Trump.\n\nThe Washington Post–ABC News poll published on January 13, 2019, found that a larger number of Americans blamed Trump and congressional Republicans than congressional Democrats for the shutdown.A PBS NewsHour–Marist poll found that on January 15, 2019, a majority of Americans thought that President Trump was to blame for the shutdown.A January 2019 poll conducted by telephone for CBS News found that 70% of Americans polled did not want a government shutdown over the issue of building a border wall; 66% believed that Trump should agree to a budget without wall funding.\n\nPresidency of Donald Trump Donald Trump January 2018 United

46,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018–2019 United States federal government shutdown', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The United States federal government shutdown from midnight EST on December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019 (35 days) was the longest government shutdown in history and the second and final federal government shutdown involving furloughs during the presidency of Donald Trump.It occurred when the 115th Congress and Trump could not agree on an appropriations bill to fund the operations of the federal government for the 2019 fiscal year, or a temporary continuing resolution that would extend the deadline for passing a bill.The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal departments or agencies from conducting non-essential operations without appropriations legislation in place.As a result, nine executive departments with around 800,000 employees had to shut down partially or in full, affecting about one-fourth of government activities and causing employees to be furloughed or required to work without being paid.The Congressional Budget Office estimated the shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion USD, excluding indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.\n\nThe shutdown stemmed from an impasse over Trump\'s demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall.In December 2018, the Senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the bill appeared likely to be approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Trump.After Trump faced heavy criticism from some right-wing media outlets and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to ""build the wall"", he announced that he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund its construction.As a result, the House passed a stopgap bill with funding for the wall, but it was blocked in the Senate by the threat of a Democratic filibuster.\n\nIn January 2019, representatives elected in the November 2018 election took office, giving the Democrats a majority in the House.The House immediately voted to approve the appropriations bill that had previously passed the Senate unanimously (which included no funding for the wall).For several weeks, Trump continued to maintain that he would veto any bill that did not fund an entire border wall, and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the Senate from considering any appropriations legislation that Trump would not support, including the bill that had previously passed.Democrats and some Republicans opposed the shutdown and passed multiple bills to reopen the government, arguing that the government shutdown amounted to ""hostage-taking"" civil servants and that negotiations could only begin once the government was reopened.\n\nOn January 25, 2019, Trump agreed to endorse a stopgap bill to reopen the government for three weeks up until February 15 to allow for negotiations to take place to approve an appropriations bill that both parties could agree on.However, Trump reiterated his demand for the border wall funding and said that he would shut down the government again or declare a national emergency and use military funding to build the wall if Congress did not appropriate the funds by February 15.\n\nTrump\'s approval rating dropped during the shutdown.A majority of Americans opposed exploitation of the shutdown as a negotiating strategy and held Trump responsible for the shutdown: A CBS News poll found that 71% of Americans considered the border wall ""not worth the shutdown"" and a Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 53% of Americans blamed Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, compared to 34% who blamed Democrats and 10% who blamed both parties.\n\nOn February 15, 2019, Trump declared a national emergency to fund the wall and bypass Congress, after being unsatisfied with a bipartisan border bill that had passed the House and the Senate a day before.\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign, then-candidate Trump promised to build a wall along the Mexico–United States border for which Mexico would pay.The president of Mexico rejected the idea of providing any funding for a U.S. border wall.In 2018, Trump requested $ in federal funding for some of barrier on the border, mostly to replace of aging fence built under the Secure Fence Act of 2006.On December 25, 2018, Trump reversed course, suggesting that he might accept of either mostly refurbished barrier (rather than new barriers in locations that did not previously have them) by November 2020.Trump\'s proposals and public statements on the wall have shifted widely over time, with varied proposals as to the design, material, length, height, and width of a wall.\n\nIn September 2018, Congress passed two ""minibus"" appropriations bills for the 2019 United States federal budget, which began on October 1, 2018.These bills combined five of the 12 regular appropriations bills covering 77% of federal discretionary funding, and included a continuing resolution until December 7 for the remaining agencies.On December 6, Congress passed a second continuing resolution to December 21, to give more time for negotiations on Trump\'s proposed border wall, which had been delayed due to the funeral of George H. W. Bush.\n\nA Senate Homeland Security appropriations bill, negotiated by both parties and reported by the committee to the Senate, provided for $ for border security, including funds for ""approximately 65 miles of pedestrian fencing along the southwest border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector"".The bill did not receive a vote on the Senate floor, although House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer indicated that such a proposal could be acceptable to House Democrats.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said the Democratic Party would not support $ for the border wall.At a press conference before the government shutdown, he noted ""the $1.6 billion for border security negotiated by Democrats and Republicans is our position.We believe that is the right way to go.""\n\nOn December 11, President Trump held a televised meeting with Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in the Oval Office and asked them to support an appropriation of $5.7 billion for funding of a border wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico.They refused, resulting in an argument between Trump and both Congressional leaders.During the contentious discussion, Trump remarked, ""I am proud to shut down the government for border security ...I will be the one to shut [the government] down.I\'m not going to blame you for it ...I will take the mantle.I will be the one to shut it down.""Schumer replied, ""We shouldn\'t shut down the government over a dispute.""Ten days later, Trump blamed Democrats for the impending shutdown.\n\nThree days later, Politico reported that Trump was willing to sign a bill with no funding for a border wall that delayed a government shutdown into 2019 and the new Congress.On December 18, following a meeting with Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the government would not shut down on December 22 and that Trump was ""flexible"" over funding for a border wall.Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby commented that the most likely resolution was a bill that funded the government until early February.Schumer added that his caucus would ""very seriously"" consider such a bill and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said ""I don\'t know anybody on the Hill that wants a shutdown, and I think all the president\'s advisers are telling him this would not be good.""\n\nOn December 19, the Senate passed a second continuing resolution () that would fund the government until February 8, 2019.Pelosi announced that House Democrats would support the measure, meaning it would overcome opposition from conservative Republicans and pass the House.On December 20, following increased criticism from conservative media, pundits, and political figures, Trump reversed his position and declared that he would not sign any funding bill that did not include border wall funding.The same day, the House passed a continuing resolution that included $5 billion for the wall and $8 billion in disaster aid.This bill failed in the Senate.Trump\'s changing position caused consternation among Senate Republicans.\n\nThe shutdown started December 22 and Trump announced that he would cancel his planned trip to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas and stay in Washington, D.C.The meaning of the term ""wall"" was expected to be an aspect of the negotiations.\n\nCongress adjourned on December 22 for the Christmas and holiday season, with many predicting that the shutdown would not be resolved until the start of the 116th Congress.The Senate reconvened on December 27 for four minutes, with Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) presiding over the session.The House briefly reconvened as well, with Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) saying that members should not expect any further votes for the rest of 2018.Representative Jim McGovern (D-MA) went to the House floor to try to force consideration of a short-term funding bill to end the shutdown that the Senate had already passed, but the Republican Speaker-pro-tem refused to let him speak.\n\nCongress then adjourned again until December 31, 2018, for a pro forma session.On January 2, 2019, the last full day of the 115th United States Congress, there was a pro forma session scheduled to last several minutes.\n\nThe new Congress was sworn in on January 3, 2019, and one of the first orders of business in the House after electing the Speaker and swearing in the new members was a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security until February 8 (), which passed by a vote of 239–192; and a package combining five appropriation bills funding the rest of the government for the remainder of the fiscal year (), passed by a vote of 241–190.The bills contained $1.3 billion of funding for border security, but no additional funding for a border wall.\n\nBeginning on January 9, the Democratic-controlled House voted on four appropriations bills individually:\n\nFinancial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Treasury (including the Internal Revenue Service), federal judiciary, District of Columbia, and a number of independent agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, General Services Administration, and Securities and Exchange Commission.The House passed the legislation on January 9, on a 240–188 vote, with every Democrat and eight Republicans voting yes, and all other Republicans voting no. Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Department of Agriculture (including food stamps), the Food and Drug Administration, and related entities.On January 10, the House passed this bill 243–183.Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore Transportation and Housing and Urban Development (including some federal mortgage programs).On January 10, the House passed this bill 244–180.Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Interior Department, Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies, including the Smithsonian Institution.On January 11, ten House Republicans voted with Democrats in a 240–179 vote to end the shutdown of Interior-Environment programs.It was the most recent of a ""series of standalone appropriations measures"" the House sent to the Senate.\n\nThis strategy has been compared to one used by Republicans during the 2013 shutdown in the form of a series of fourteen mini-continuing resolutions.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed that the Senate would not consider the House bills to reopen the government, indicating that Senate Republicans would not support any bill unless it had Trump\'s support.In January 2019, McConnell and Senate Republicans came under increased pressure to break the impasse and reopen the government.Three Republican Senators—Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Cory Gardner of Colorado—called for an end to the shutdown.Senators Collins and Gardner said they supported the House\'s budget bills to end the shutdown.West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito said that she could support ending the shutdown provided border wall talks continued.Pat Roberts of Kansas said that shutdowns ""never work"" and only turned affected federal workers into ""pawns"" and that, although the time had not yet come for Senate Republicans to override any possible Trump veto and end the shutdown, ""we\'re getting pretty close.""Johnny Isakson of Georgia echoed that sentiment, saying that support for McConnell\'s refusal to support bills that do not include funding for a wall would not last indefinitely: ""There\'s a time when that may run out.""\n\nOn January 16, McConnell again blocked the House appropriation bills to reopen the government from being considered on the Senate floor.The following day, McConnell blocked consideration of bills to reopen most of the closed government agencies for a third time.On January 23, McConnell blocked a bill to reopen most of the government for the fourth time.\n\nOn January 22, McConnell stated that the Senate would be voting on two different bills to end the shutdown on January 24.The first vote is on a bill to reopen the government which includes Trump\'s proposal to provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and temporary protections to some immigration classes.The other bill is a three-week continuing resolution to fund 25% of the government through February 8.\n\nOn January 22, Senator Mark Warner introduced a bill to keep the federal government running in the event of future shutdown events.The bill is called the ""Stop Shutdowns Transferring Unnecessary Pain and Inflicting Damage in the Coming Years Act"" or the ""Stop STUPIDITY Act"".\n\nOn January 24, the Senate held two votes on competing Democratic and Republican proposals to end the shutdown.The Democratic proposal was largely similar to the measure that had previously passed the Senate unanimously in the 115th Congress, and then been passed by the Democratic-controlled House in the 116th Congress.It provided funding for the government with no money for the border wall.The Republican proposal incorporated Trump\'s proposal, which would fund a border wall; temporarily extend TPS and DACA for three years, but would substantially narrow eligibility for DACA; and make significant legal changes to make it more difficult for persons escaping violence and persecution to be granted asylum in the United States.Neither proposal was able to attain the 60 votes needed for passage.The Trump plan failed in a 50–47 vote.The Democratic plan failed in a 52–44 vote.Most Republicans voted for Trump\'s plan and against the Democratic plan.Most Democrats voted for the Democratic plan and against Trump\'s plan.Republicans Tom Cotton and Mike Lee voted against both plans.Democrat Joe Manchin and Republicans Lamar Alexander, Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, Johnny Isakson, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney voted for both plans.Not voting on either were Republicans Rand Paul and Jim Risch and Democrat Jacky Rosen.Republican Richard Burr voted for Trump\'s plan and did not vote on the Democratic plan.\n\nOn January 25, House Democrats prepared a compromise proposal to reopen the government, which would provide $5 billion for border security but no wall construction.However, the shutdown ended the same day.\n\nOn January 4, after the new Congress was sworn-in and Pelosi regained the speakership, she and Schumer, as well as congressional Republican leadership met with Trump at the White House.Pelosi and Schumer argued that the shutdown needed to end and reported that Trump refused.They said that Trump threatened to ""keep the government closed for a very long period of time.Months or even years.""Later that day, Trump admitted to ""absolutely"" making that threat, adding, ""I\'m very proud of doing what I\'m doing.""Trump then said that he was considering declaring a national emergency to use military funding for the wall.At the meeting, Trump reprimanded his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney for attempting to propose a compromise between Trump\'s $5.7 billion demand for a border wall and the Democrats\' proposal of $1.3 billion for border security.\n\nTrump addressed the nation from the Oval Office at 9 p.m. EST on January 8, in a nationally televised address broadcast on both network and cable television.In his speech, Trump asserted that there was a ""growing humanitarian and security crisis"" on the Mexico–United States border that could only be solved by appropriating $5.7 billion for construction of a steel wall.Trump did not make any new proposals in his speech to break the impasse.Immediately after Trump\'s speech, Schumer and Pelosi delivered a response on behalf of the Democrats, in which they demanded an end to the shutdown and said: ""President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government.""\n\nTrump met with congressional leadership again on January 9, in a meeting lasting 14 minutes.Trump asked Pelosi, ""Will you agree to my wall?"" and when she replied that she would not, Trump said ""bye-bye"" and walked out of the meeting, later declaring it ""a total waste of time"".Schumer accused Trump of throwing a ""temper tantrum"" and slamming his hands on the table.Trump rebuked Schumer\'s comments on Twitter.Vice President Mike Pence and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that Trump remained calm and never raised his voice.On January 10, Pelosi described the preceding day\'s meeting with Trump as ""a setup"" staged by White House aides so that Trump could walk out of the meeting.Pelosi described Trump as ""un-presidential""; accused him of ""exploiting this situation in a way that enhances his power""; and said: ""I don\'t think he really wants a solution.I think he loves the distraction.""\n\nAfter Trump walked out of the January 9 meeting with congressional Democratic leaders, no further negotiations were conducted.Several Republican senators met in the office of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, after the meeting to discuss a compromise to end the shutdown.They discussed agreeing to Trump\'s demand for border wall funding and offering the Democrats help for Dreamers, refugee protections and extensions to H-2B visas.On January 13, Graham proposed that Trump agree to a congressional vote to reopen the government pending the resumption of negotiations.Graham suggested that if Trump and congressional Democrats did not come to an agreement at that time, Trump could declare a national emergency.Trump rejected this proposal the next day.\n\nOn January 19, Trump proposed a temporary extension of the two programs that protect about 700,000 immigrants from deportation—Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)—in exchange for funding for the border wall.The protections would be temporary, with no path to citizenship.Trump had previously revoked TPS for people from a number of Latin American and African countries, and taken steps to rescind DACA.In his remarks at the White House, Trump referred to a ""barrier"" rather than a ""wall"" and indicated that he aimed to erect ""steel barriers in high priority locations"" rather than ""a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea.""\n\nIn addition to funding a border wall, the 1,300-page Republican bill released after Trump made his proposal would make major changes to U.S. immigration policy (which were not included in Trump\'s public announcement).The legislation would severely restrict the ability of children from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to apply for asylum in the United States.Specifically, participation in the Central American Minors Program would be subject to an annual cap and migrant children would be barred from applying for asylum in person at the border, and only migrant children with a ""qualified"" parent in the U.S. would be eligible to apply.The bill would also create a new, more burdensome application process for TPS holders, and would exclude TPS holders from Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen.The American Immigration Lawyers Association government relations director said that the proposal ""would categorically block tens of thousands of children from ever applying for asylum,"" while a Cato Institute immigration analyst wrote that the proposal would not extend DACA, but rather replace it with ""a totally different program that will exclude untold thousands of Dreamers who would have been eligible under DACA.""\n\nDemocrats rejected Trump\'s proposal.In a speech on the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""The president\'s proposal is one-sided, harshly partisan and was made in bad faith.The asylum changes are a poison pill, if there ever was one.""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said extending the DACA proposal temporarily was ""unacceptable"" and a ""non-starter"" because it did not ""represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people\'s lives.""Analysts pointed out that Trump had previously rejected a deal that would have provided funding for the border wall in exchange for further protection for DACA recipients.Conversely, Republicans reacted positively to Trump\'s proposal, and Mitch McConnell said he would bring it to a vote in the Senate.\n\nDuring the shutdown, on January 8 in a press conference, a reporter asked Trump if he was considering declaring a national emergency, to which Trump replied, ""I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want"" and suggested that he could declare an emergency.After this, Trump repeatedly threatened to declare a national emergency to unilaterally order wall construction without congressional authorization.Some of Trump\'s advisors, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, reportedly attempted to dissuade him from doing so.Administration officials considered diverting hurricane-relief and wildfire-relief funds from a $13.9 billion February 2018 emergency supplemental appropriations bill (for disaster relief in Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California, among other places) in order to fund a wall, and directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to look into this possibility.\n\nAn attempt by Trump to invoke emergency powers would almost certainly have prompted a lengthy legal challenge in court.Democrats responded that Trump lacked the authority to declare a national emergency; Representative Adam Schiff called it a ""non-starter"" and said that ""if Harry Truman couldn\'t nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this President doesn\'t have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion dollar wall on the border.""Democratic Representative Nydia Velázquez said the notion of redirecting disaster-relief funds to a border wall was ""beyond appalling"".Presidents have declared emergencies in the past, but none has ""involved funding a policy goal after failing to win congressional approval"".Yale Law School professor Bruce Ackerman wrote that the declaration of a national emergency to build a wall as Trump suggested would be unconstitutional and illegal.Other scholars, such as Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice, believed that Trump could make a colorable argument that diverting military-construction appropriations for border-wall construction was legal, but that doing so would be an abuse of power.Law professor Ilya Somin stated that in the unlikely case that Trump succeeded in using the emergency powers in this way, it would set a dangerous precedent, which Republicans would come to regret next time the president was a Democrat.\n\nOn January 11, Trump—while maintaining he has the authority to do so anytime—said he was not in any rush to declare a national emergency to secure wall funding, saying he would rather see Congress ""do its job"" and that the Democrats ""should come back and vote.""The next day he again threatened to use emergency powers if Democrats did not ""come to their senses.""\n\nOn January 16, Pelosi sent a letter to Trump that indicated the House would be unavailable for the 2019 State of the Union Address that was scheduled for January 29.Pelosi wrote, ""Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government reopens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has reopened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on Jan. 29.""The delivery of the State of the Union address had been delayed or substantially changed on only two occasions since 1913.In a letter sent to the Speaker the next day, Trump said she would not be allowed to take military transport aircraft on scheduled visits to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan.Trump replied, ""We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the shutdown is over.""Pelosi and a congressional delegation had planned on visiting overseas American military personnel.\n\nOn January 23, Trump sent a letter to Pelosi insisting that there were no security concerns and that he would hold the State of the Union Address as scheduled.Trump wrote, ""Therefore, I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and Congress of the United States of America regarding the State of our Union.""In a letter sent in reply, Pelosi stated that the House would not consider a concurrent resolution to authorize the State of the Union Address in the House Chamber until the shutdown ended, writing, ""Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened.""\n\nTrump later stated he would look for an alternative, but then retracted that statement in a pair of tweets announcing that he would wait until the end of the shutdown to give the address in the House Chamber.\n\nOn January 25, Trump announced his support for a three-week funding measure that would reopen the government until February 15.The deal, which also moved forward with long-term Department of Homeland Security funding, did not include funds for a wall.As expected, the agreement provided federal employees with back pay.Both the Senate and House of Representatives passed the funding measure by voice vote, sending the resolution to the President\'s desk.Trump signed the bill the same day, ending the shutdown.\n\nLater in January, Republican senators voted unanimously against a bill to provide back pay to federal contractors.\n\nWithout legislation enacted by February 15, a new partial shutdown would have begun, three weeks after the last ended.A bipartisan group of senators and representatives reached an agreement ""in principle"" on February 11, but Trump did not say whether he would sign it.Included was $1.375 billion for 55 miles of steel border fencing.On February 13, it was reported that, against the wishes of Democratic leaders and many Republicans, Trump was blocking the provision of back pay to federal contractors who were still out of pocket from the shutdown.Both houses passed the bill February 14 with enough votes to override a veto if that happened.\n\nOn February 15, at the White House Rose Garden, Trump announced that he had signed the spending bill to keep the government open.He also declared a national emergency, hoping to get access to $8 billion to use for border security.\n\nAgencies funded by two ""minibus"" appropriations bills passed in September 2018 were not affected by the shutdown.About 380,000 federal employees were furloughed, and an additional 420,000 employees for the affected agencies were expected to work with their pay delayed until the end of the shutdown, totaling 800,000 workers affected out of 2.1 million civilian non-postal federal employees.As only about a quarter of the government was shut down, many people who are not federal employees did not fully realize the effects of the shutdown.\n\nAccording to and , these were the affected agencies:\n\nDepartment of State Department of the Treasury Department of Justice Most of the Department of the Interior Department of Agriculture Department of Commerce Department of Housing and Urban Development Department of Transportation Department of Homeland Security Some Department of Health and Human Services agencies Food and Drug Administration Indian Health Service Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Superfund Research Program Executive Office of the President Most independent agencies Judicial Branch\n\nUnaffected agencies include, according to and :\n\nDepartment of Defense Department of Labor Most of the Department of Health and Human Services Department of Energy Department of Education Department of Veterans Affairs Some Department of the Interior agencies Bureau of Reclamation Central Utah Project District of Columbia (excluding courts) Legislative Branch Social Security Administration Nuclear Regulatory Commission Appalachian Regional Commission Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board Delta Regional Authority Denali Commission Northern Border Regional Commission Southeast Crescent Regional Commission Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board American Battle Monuments Commission U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Cemeterial Expenses of the Army, including Arlington National Cemetery and Soldiers\' and Airmen\'s Home National Cemetery Armed Forces Retirement Home Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System Fund Intelligence Community Management Account Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled Corporation for National and Community Service Corporation for Public Broadcasting Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission Institute of Museum and Library Services Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission Medicare Payment Advisory Commission National Council on Disability National Labor Relations Board National Mediation Board Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission Railroad Retirement Board\n\nJobs affected included staff throughout the United States, not just DC area employees.FBI agents, federal corrections officers, FDA inspectors, NASA employees, TSA staff, Border Patrol staff and CBP officers, census staff, National Park Service staff, members of the Coast Guard, and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers either worked without pay or were furloughed, with increasing numbers of unpaid essential employees failing to show up for work.\n\nOn January 11, 800,000 workers for agencies shutdown or furloughed missed their first paycheck.Federal workers normally receive pay on federal holidays, which include Christmas, New Year\'s Day and potentially Martin Luther King Jr. Day.The shutdown affected the employees\' entitlement to paid holidays due to the shutdown.Unemployment assistance to federal workers furloughed under the government shutdown varied by locality.Only non-reporting workers were eligible for assistance, whereas furloughed workers who still reported to work were not.Workers who received unemployment assistance were required pay it back after the shut down ended and they received backpay.Some furloughed workers sought other employment opportunities while they were idled.However, external employment must meet agency-specific ethics guidelines, and mandatory reviews of external employment were also curtailed as most ethics officials were also furloughed.Federal employees were not able to use vacation or sick leave during the shutdown so scheduled holiday vacation time either became unpaid if the worker was deemed non-essential or was cancelled if the worker was deemed essential.In many cases unused leave over a certain threshold expired at year-end, but employees who had leave scheduled in advance of the shutdown did not have ""use or lose"" leave balances deducted from their accrued leave.Many furloughed employees took to crowd-funding campaigns to raise cash to replace missed paychecks, but these types of solicitations also run afoul of government ethics rules.\n\nAs furloughed federal workers and their families shared stories of their hardships, such as not being able to meet rent or mortgage payments and missed bills, the hashtag ""#ShutdownStories"" went viral on social media.The federal government\'s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) responded by publishing sample letters that employees could send to their creditors.One read, in part, ""I am a Federal employee who has recently been furloughed due to a lack of funding of my agency.Because of this, my income has been severely cut and I am unable to pay the entire cost of my mortgage, along with my other expenses.""Other federal workers reached out to other news outlets to share stories about having to stretch their budgets and the impact of the shutdown on their families.In addition to being unable to meet rent or pay bills, many federal workers around the country were unable to pay for groceries and turned to food banks.One federal prison guard in Louisiana attempted suicide after posting about the financial pressures of the shutdown on Facebook.\n\nThe OPM also suggested that employees who had landlords write: ""I would like to discuss with you the possibility of trading my services to perform maintenance (e.g. painting, carpentry work) in exchange for partial rent payments"" and suggested those who lacked funds to pay bills should hire personal attorneys to assist them.Other organizations also posted advice on how to ""find supplemental income""; the Coast Guard suggested that Coast Guard members ""have a garage sale, offer to watch children, walk pets or house sit"" while furloughed.\n\nOn January 4, The Washington Post reported that because the shutdown was triggered by the failure to enact spending bills that continued a federal government pay freeze, hundreds of senior Trump administration political appointees would receive a roughly $10,000 pay raise the following day.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the pending pay raise was an ""unnecessary byproduct of the shutdown.""\n\nOn January 10, the Senate approved by unanimous consent a bill (S.24, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019) providing that furloughed federal employees would receive back pay for the period of the furlough once appropriations were restored; the bill was approved the next day by the House on a vote of 411–7.Trump signed the bill into law on January 16.\n\nNative American tribes were not paid for treaties negotiated with the United States government.These treaties specified that the federal government must provide funding for health clinics, employee salaries, education, infrastructure and other services, which were not paid during the shutdown.Native lands are ""owned, managed and maintained by the federal government.""Native Americans who receive a per capita check for profits from oil and gas sales from tribal land did not receive check for the month of February.Roads were not plowed on tribal land, and some areas received significant snowfall.This caused people of the Navajo Nation to become trapped inside their homes.Food services, which fed 90,000 Native Americans in 2017, were halted.\n\nNative American communities had a high percentage of individuals who worked for the federal government and lost income during the shutdown.In North and South Dakota, one of the largest employers is the Indian Health Service.The Chippewa tribe reported an economic loss of nearly $100,000 daily in funds that the federal government was supposed to provide as a treaty obligation.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was closed for the shutdown.However, 60 percent of the Indian Health Service (IHS) continued to work without pay.IHS provides care for 2.2 million Native Americans and on January 23, began to deny care that was not considered ""life threatening.""The Bureau of Indian Education was able to stay open because it was funded on a different schedule.Unlike other government shutdowns, there was little outreach from the Trump Administration to Native Americans and the Chippewa tribe in Michigan was given a 24-hour notice that the shutdown would take place and affect the tribe.\n\nThe only military branch that was affected by the shutdown was the Coast Guard because it was part of the Department of Homeland Security, while the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps were all funded through the Department of Defense.Officials were able to fund payment on December 31, 2018, but were not able to do so for the paychecks of January 15 and 30, 2019, along with the pay and benefits for civilian workers and retirees.During the shutdown, the Coast Guard continued to engage in patrolling the American coastline and carrying out overseas missions in locations such as the Persian Gulf along with the Navy and in the Caribbean.Other issues arose in the payment processes for Coast Guard members Tricare Health and Dental Program payments, although the individuals were still covered.\n\nMilitary schools, such as the Coast Guard Academy and the National War College, lost funding due to the shutdown and the schools had to work to find funds to pay professors.\n\nAlthough the Department of Defense was not shut down, the February 4, 2019, date for release of the Pentagon\'s 2020 budget was delayed by at least one month.This had repercussions on the interim period which is usually used by Pentagon planners for adjustments before the 2020 fiscal year which will begin in October 2019.The White House Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the Pentagon request, was shut down when the Pentagon budget arrived in December, and remained inactive, so no work was done on the budget.\n\nOn February 25, 2019, the Pentagon\'s counter-drug (interdiction) funding has up to $85 million not yet obligated, but that money was planned for the known corridors in El Paso, Tucson, Yuma, and El Centro for border fencing, lighting, and road projects, so any funds which might possibly be intended for additional projects elsewhere along the border must be obligated by September 30, 2019, in order not to affect the known corridors.Otherwise appropriations above the $85 million not yet obligated for additional interdiction border projects will have to be approved by additional Congressional appropriations, to reach the $2 billion target.\n\nA January 28, 2019 Congressional Budget Office report estimated that the 35-day partial government shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion, including $3 billion in permanent losses; the CBO estimate excluded indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.The furloughing of 145,000 federal workers and 112,500 federal contractors in the Washington Metropolitan Area cost the regional economy $119 million each day, or 7.3% of the region\'s total output.That reduced GDP by over $2.8 billion in the Washington DC area alone.The shutdown also had a noticeable impact on hunger in the national capital region: food pantries in Washington DC and Northern Virginia reported an increase of around 10% in the number of people coming to pick up groceries, with most of that increase coming from federal workers and contractors.\n\nFitch Ratings warned that an extended shutdown might lead to a downgrade in the U.S.\'s Triple-A credit rating if lawmakers were unable to pass a budget or manage the debt ceiling.That in turn would make borrowing more costly for companies and American households, because it is the benchmark for many other lines of credit.The only time the U.S. credit rating has been downgraded by S&P was during the United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011.\n\nSome economists believed that an extended shutdown would weaken consumer confidence and heighten the risk of pushing the U.S. economy into a recession.Between 800,000 federal government employees and some 4 million federal contractors, the shutdown directly affected nearly 3% of the labor force of the United States; in a typical recession, unemployment increases 2–4%.The reduction in spending by those households combined with the reduction of government services could have macroeconomic results similar to a typical recession.The shutdown had an adverse effect on the budgets of state and local governments, as states covered some federal services (particularly the most vulnerable) during the shutdown.\n\nBy mid-January 2019, the White House Council of Economic Advisors estimated that each week of the shutdown reduced GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, the equivalent of 1.2 points per quarter.CEA chairman Kevin Hassett later acknowledged that GDP growth could decline to zero in the first quarter of 2019 if the shutdown lasted the entire quarter.\n\nAs tax season began in the United States on January 28, some 46,000 Internal Revenue Service workers were called back to work to ensure tax refunds and returns were not affected by the shutdown.The recalled workers allowed the department to continue operations that were automatic and those deemed necessary for the safety of human life or protection of government property, such as processing electronic returns, returns with payments, mailing tax forms, appeals, criminal law enforcement investigations and technical support.\n\nDuring the shutdown, 95% of federal staff for the USDA\'s Food and Nutrition Services were furloughed.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the food-stamp program, could be funded through a $3 billion contingency fund appropriated by Congress in 2018; if the shutdown had continued through March 2019, those funds would have been exhausted, leaving some 38 million Americans without food stamps and endangering food security.Concerns were raised that continuation of the shutdown could delay the issuance of some $140 billion in tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees most of the food supply in the U.S.In early January, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner, reported that the FDA suspended food inspections.He noted that inspection of foreign food was continuing as ""almost normal,"" because they are considered vital.Around January 14, ""high-risk"" food inspections resumed.As of January 22, 2019, 46 percent of the FDA were working, though 20 percent of them were working without pay.During the shutdown, two new recalls for contamination with Listeria or Salmonella took place.Consumer advocacy groups advised of food safety issues during the shutdown.Food safety attorney, Bill Marler, advocated against eating ""fresh, uncooked products on the market place.""Because there was a shortage of FDA inspectors, many imported perishable items, such as produce or flowers, were at risk of spoilage.Meat and some egg products are inspected by the USDA\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service.Federal legislation required those inspectors to remain working without pay.\n\nSchool administrations raised concern about how to feed children who purchase food at the schools for lunch, as funding concerns caused some districts to conserve food and funding.Many limited the amount or variation of foods available for the children to purchase, and alerted parents to the concerns and the limited availability of some of the items.Most schools affected were in high-poverty areas, and depended on federally funded lunch programs, such as the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) a federal grant established by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 and operated through the Department of Agriculture.Some 22 million students in nearly 100,000 schools received school meals through that operation.\n\nAs with the January 2018 shutdown, national parks were expected to be open to the extent practical, though there would be no staff and buildings would be closed.The shutdown affected national parks unevenly, some were accessible with bare-bones staffing levels, some operated with money from states or charitable groups, and others were locked off.Diane Regas, president and chief executive of the Trust for Public Land, called upon Trump to close all national parks to protect the public: by the third week of the shutdown, three people had died in national parks.This number was reported as being within \'usual\' levels.At Yosemite National Park, on January 4, 2019, a death from a fall went unreported for a week.\n\nBy January 1, 2019, the problems of neglected trash pileup, overflowing public toilets, and access to first aid were repeated across the Park system.Health and safety concerns were raised, with concerns by scientists that the expansive amount of garbage and human waste could impact water and soil quality, or cause damage to animals in the parks.Other issues that arose due to the shutdown included illegal campsites, protected agriculture being damaged, damaging of government property and trespassing on foot and by vehicle.\n\nNew York kept the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open, as it did during the January 2018 shutdown.Arizona and Utah were able to keep Grand Canyon National Park, Zion National Park, Arches National Park, and Bryce Canyon National Park open and provided services including public restrooms, shuttles and trash collection.Utah\'s funding included visitor centers.The sites closed outright in the southwest alone included Bandelier National Monument and Valles Caldera National Preserve in northern New Mexico, White Sands National Monument in southern New Mexico, Petrified Forest National Park in northern Arizona and Casa Grande Ruins National Monument in south-central Arizona.Access to major parts of Sequoia and Kings Canyon parks were closed, and at Joshua Tree National Park, the administration policy of leaving parks open to visitors despite the staff furloughs resulted in park damage, including the toppling of protected trees.In Texas, Big Bend National Park had no visitor services, such as restrooms.Some trailheads were closed.Regulations continued to be enforced, as the park remained open.Visitors were reminded to remove their own trash and toilet paper.The Alamo remained open but no NPS services were available at the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park.Channel Islands National Park remained open to public access, although services normally provided by the national park service were instead provided by Island Packers Cruises, the company normally in charge of ferries to the islands.\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration closed immediately on December 22, 2018.The Library of Congress, the U.S. Botanic Garden, the Capitol Visitor Center, and the U.S. Capitol Building remained open as they were funded by the 2019 Legislative Branch appropriations bill.The Smithsonian Institution operated on ""prior-year funds"" through January 1, 2019.On January 2, 2019, the Smithsonian Institution initiated an orderly shutdown of all its facilities, including 19 museums in Washington, D.C., and New York City, the National Zoo, and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.The following day, the National Gallery of Art was closed.The National Zoo also closed on January 3, 2019.Tourism attendance on the National Mall was affected.On January 5, 2019, acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt directed the diversion of fee revenue defined by the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to be used to fund minimal maintenance activities so as to preserve access to highly visited parks.\n\nAccording to a January 12, 2019, article in The Economist, on January 11, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was unable to pay its workers who had not been paid since December 22; 55% more of them called in sick than in January 2018.\n\nAs the air traffic controllers were deemed essential employees, they were required to work without pay.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents air traffic controllers, filed a lawsuit against the federal government for the shutdown on January 11, 2019, claiming that requiring 16,000 air traffic controllers to work without being paid violated their constitutional rights and federal minimum wage law.That was the third lawsuit filed against the federal government since the beginning of the shutdown.\n\nAirline and aircraft safety inspectors, on the other hand, were deemed nonessential and furloughed.A news report on January 12, 2019, stated that the Federal Aviation Administration had returned 500 furloughed safety inspectors back to work and would return more to work in the following weeks.As the airline and aircraft safety inspectors were furloughed, the certification process of the Airbus A220 in the US was stalled.Delta Air Lines was forced to delay the launch of the new aircraft, and to use other models of aircraft to serve those routes that was supposed to be served with A220.Many TSA employees also called out sick, most of them because they were trying to find other jobs that would provide immediate paychecks.\n\nThe shutdown initially prevented the National Transportation Safety Board from assisting the Mexican government\'s investigation of the 2018 Puebla helicopter crash that killed a state governor and senator; an exception allowed the NTSB to assist with the Mexican government in the investigation along with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.The NTSB also had to delay several investigations until the government reopened and only continued investigations into accidents that were considered the most serious.Issues in receiving certification and oversight from the FAA led to a month-long delay in the commencement of passenger service at Paine Field in Everett, Washington.\n\nAs the shutdown continued into its fourth week, the unions representing airline pilots, flight attendants and air traffic controllers issued a statement asserting, ""we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play"" because of the shutdown.\n\nSome airports such as the Philadelphia International Airport, launched food and item donations for federal employees who were affected by the shutdown.Other airports such as the Miami International Airport, and the George Bush International Airport, closed down terminals in order to spread out the TSA workers that were available.\n\nOn January 25, flights destined for LaGuardia Airport in New York were halted to a groundstop by FAA officials due to staffing shortages directly as a result of the shutdown.As a result, several flights to and from neighboring airports in the Northeast, specifically Philadelphia and Newark, suffered significant delays of their own.Soon after that, appropriations passed and the government reopened.\n\nThe shutdown delayed software updates to the Boeing 737 MAX airplane which may have caused the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.\n\nDuring the shutdown, court-appointed private lawyers who represent indigent defendants worked without pay.The Federal Judiciary initially had a goal of sustaining paid operations through January 18, 2019.It said it would run out of money to sustain court operations no earlier than January 25, but perhaps as late as February 1.Failing funding, the Judiciary would operate under the terms of the Antideficiency Act.This Act does not allow federal agencies to expend federal funds before an appropriation, nor to accept any voluntary services.The judiciary had 33,000 employees nationwide.Under the Constitution, Supreme Court Justices, appeals court judges and district judges would continue to be paid.\n\nThe shutdown caused many delays and disruptions in cases.Budgets were watched carefully to be able to pay public defenders, DNA testing, informants, and travel costs to interview victims and witnesses.Staffing issues also brought about concerns and constraints with prisons lacking the staff to safely hold attorney-client visits, and caused a delay in bail hearings.\n\nAgents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed in a report released on January 22, 2019, by the FBI Agents Association, that several different investigations were compromised by the shutdown.The report was called ""Voices from the Field"" and was 72 pages long.FBI agents were unable to pay Confidential Human Sources which risks losing that informant permanently.Some FBI divisions no longer have Spanish-speaking staff on hand and could not work with informants who only speak Spanish.Some agents reported that they did not have the funds to assist in joint operations with local law enforcement.\n\nFederal law enforcement agencies working on Native American land worked without pay through the shutdown.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was forced to cancel a trip to the United States/Mexico border in early January due to the shutdown.DHS was also unable to inspect Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities during the shutdown to ensure that immigrants were being held in facilities appropriately.During the shutdown, the federal government\'s e-Verify system—a system for employers to check the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States—was halted.\n\nDuring the shutdown, a wave of Domain Name System (DNS) attacks on government sites was detected by Homeland Security.The attacks were serious because these Internet sites could be hijacked.\n\nOfficial websites for agencies were rendered insecure or inaccessible through the shutdown, as the expired digital certificates were not renewed.On January 23, DHS asked all government agencies to secure their DNS records; however, many agencies were not able to respond quickly to this request.\n\nExecutive and legislative affairs of the local government of the District of Columbia continued operating through the shutdown, due to a provision previously enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017.The District\'s local court system, including the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, are part of the federal judiciary.Thus, they were partially shut down, preventing District residents from accessing services such as marriage licensing.The District of Columbia government said it would take over trash collection and snow plowing operations for National Park Service facilities in Washington.\n\nThe shutdown also interfered with the response to the 2018 Sunda Strait tsunami, as the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta\'s Twitter account was unable to tweet updates, and the United States Geological Survey was unable to provide data on the tsunami.The American weather model, the GFS, suffered a significant drop in forecast quality when a data format change during the shutdown prevented certain weather data from being recognized by the GFS, and the shutdown prevented the bug from being corrected.\n\nBy mid-day Thursday, January 3, 2019, the FCC had suspended operations.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai canceled his trip to the Consumer Electronics Show.The FTC also suspended certain online operations.The EPA and Department of Energy\'s Energy Star website was not available for the duration of the shutdown.\n\nMakers of alcoholic beverages were unable to receive approval from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau for new labels and recipes during the shutdown.\n\nBased on the recalculation of their operating reserves, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) would have had to cease patent operations in the second week of February.A cadre of personnel was allocated to continue receiving patent applications, receive payments, and maintain the IT infrastructure.Even though the USPTO is self-funded, a Congressional appropriation is required to permit the USPTO to spend money.The pipeline of patent applications at the time took 15.8 months for a response from an examiner.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution shortened to two days and downscaled its scheduled ten-day 2019 Folklife Festival on the National Mall because of the shutdown\'s effects.Sabrina Motley, the director of the festival, said that initially, crucial funding for the June—July event arrived later than expected, slowing preparations.Motley stated: ""The government opened back up, but it took a while for systems to come back online. ...We looked at our production schedule, and it became clear we would need more time than we had.""\n\nThe White House residence staff who stage public receptions were among those furloughed, with a minimal staff continuing to work unpaid for the first family.In the midst of the shutdown Trump invited the Clemson Tigers football team to a White House dinner reception on January 14 in recognition of their College Football Playoff National Championship win.On the morning of the reception Trump announced that he intended to serve fast food hamburgers and pizza to the team, a remark that some commentators interpreted as a joke.That evening Trump welcomed the team in the State Dining Room with a buffet of fast food and pizza from McDonald\'s, Wendy\'s and other restaurant chains, which he stated that he had paid for personally.Trump served fast food to other visiting athletes later that year, after the shutdown had ended.\n\nOn January 10, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with several other unions, announced plans to protest the government shutdown at 1:00pm EST in Washington, DC.Leaders of the National Federation of Federal Employees stated they had hoped that bringing federal workers to the President\'s doorstep would show him that it was the individual workers that the shutdown was hurting the most.President Trump had left to visit the US–Mexican border in Texas earlier in the day.\n\nSimilar protests took place in Philadelphia and St. Louis, among other cities.On January 15, representatives for Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, and Vietnam Veterans of America along with others called for an end to shutdown, but avoided placing any blame on political parties.\n\nShortly after the protests, the American Federation of Government Employees sued the Trump administration to challenge the arrangements for work without pay during the shutdown.A similar suit was raised and won during the 2013 Federal Government shutdown.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association also sued the Trump administration, as the shutdown allegedly violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by failing to pay the workers at least a minimum wage during the shutdown.\n\nAs the salaries for members of Congress are written into permanent law and not funded through annual appropriations, the government shutdown did not affect their salaries.Senators and Representatives were still paid their biweekly salaries of $6,700 towards at least $174,000 a year.\n\nSeveral Democratic and Republican Senators and Representatives said they would donate or refuse their salary during the shutdown.Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw stated that he would refuse his salary, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto indicated she would donate hers to a Nevada charity, Senator Mazie Hirono said she would donate her salary to Hawaii food banks, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would give hers to refugee non-profit HIAS, New York Congressman Max Rose stated that he would give his salary to charity and outgoing Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota pledged hers to charity, along with her Republican colleague John Hoeven.Republican senator Kevin Cramer, who defeated Heidi Heitkamp in the 2018 midterm elections, refused to donate his salary, calling the move ""gimmicky"".Representative Brian Fitzpatrick urged all members of Congress to decline their paychecks.He said, ""If you\'re in Congress, don\'t just delay your pay -- forfeit it, write a check back to the US Treasury.Then you\'ll feel the pain of federal workers.""\n\nBy January 17, 2019, 102 members of Congress—20 Senators and 82 Representatives— chose to decline their paychecks or were donating their paychecks to charity.\n\nDuring the shutdown, many federal workers used food banks and food pantries in order to feed themselves and their families.Many food pantries waived certain restrictions in order to help government workers have access to food.During the shutdown, the Salvation Army Emergency Disasters Services program provided meals for federal workers.Chef Jose Andres created the #ChefsForFeds program to feed federal workers in Washington, D.C. and by January 21, made announcements to expand the program nationwide.\n\nSome states such as California, offered furloughed employees unemployment benefits, although the Trump administration allegedly told states that they could not do so with federal funds.Organizations such as state Attorney Generals offices, and credit card companies posted statements to their websites to offer a means to help to consolidate debt, meet mortgages or other payments such as child support or tuition.An employment law firm offered pro bono legal advice to furloughed federal employees.School districts opened up free or reduced lunch options for children of federal employees, and looked into other options to aid parents amid concerns that financial stress at home would adversely affect families and children.Every mainline denomination in America has contributed to efforts to provide relief.One Baptist church emptied its entire disaster fund to aid federal employees.\n\nOn January 24, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross downplayed the financial difficulties faced by the 800,000 federal workers affected by the shutdown, stating that they should borrow money to ""tide them over"" until the shutdown ends.Critics and Democrats criticized the statement as inappropriate, noting that Ross\' own net worth is estimated at almost $700 million, accusing him of being out of touch with the workers.Ross also said that he ""did not understand"" why people who were not getting paid due to the shutdown were visiting food banks.When asked about Ross\' statement, Trump suggested that grocery stores will ""work along"" with the government by voluntarily extending credit to those who are out of funds to buy food.National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow characterized the shutdown as a ""glitch"" and suggested that federal workers who were required to work without pay were ""volunteering"" to work for their love of the country and ""presumably their allegiance to President Trump.""\n\nIn a video message to staff, FBI director Christopher Wray stated, ""Making some people stay home when they don\'t want to, and making others show up without pay, it\'s mind-boggling, it\'s shortsighted and it\'s unfair.It takes a lot to get me angry, but I\'m about as angry as I\'ve been in a long, long time.""\n\nLara Trump, a daughter-in-law of the President, drew outrage after an interview in which she stated that while ""It\'s not fair to you..."" the shutdown was ""...a little bit of pain, but it\'s going to be for the future of our country, and their children and their grandchildren and generations after them will thank them for their sacrifice right now.""Her comments drew criticism by politicians, celebrities, and the general public who felt the advisor and spokeswoman for the Trump 2020 campaign was out of touch, however Lara Trump later claimed the comments were taken out of context.\n\nIn January 2019, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that 56% of the responding public opposed a wall while 39% favored it, and 45% viewed the situation at the border as a crisis.The numbers were similar to the poll in December 2018 yet a later poll by ABC News showed that as the partial shutdown entered its fourth week support for building a wall was increasing.A poll done through YouGov between December 23–25, 2018, reported that 51% of respondents thought Trump deserved ""a lot"" of the blame, 44% thought congressional Democrats and 39% thought congressional Republicans.Similar results were reported by a December 21–25 survey done by Reuters and Ipsos in which 47% of respondents said that the shutdown was the President\'s fault and 33% blamed Congressional Democrats.\n\nOver the course of the shutdown, Trump\'s approval rating marginally declined while his disapproval rating marginally increased.His net approval rating was by the middle of January 2019 at its lowest point since February 2018.On December 27, 2018, it was reported that Trump\'s approval rating of registered voters was at 39%, with 56% disapproval.Broken down the rating was split across party lines, with Republicans reporting an 80% approval rate while Democrats and independents reported a 90% and 57% disapproval rating, respectively.The poll was conducted through Morning Consult between December 21–23.The poll also reported that 43% of respondents blamed Trump for the shutdown, with 31% blaming congressional Democrats and 7% congressional Republicans.Another poll through The New York Times Upshot/Siena College reported that 89% of voters\' views on Trump and the wall were aligned, suggesting that support for the wall was a function of support for Trump.\n\nThe Washington Post–ABC News poll published on January 13, 2019, found that a larger number of Americans blamed Trump and congressional Republicans than congressional Democrats for the shutdown.A PBS NewsHour–Marist poll found that on January 15, 2019, a majority of Americans thought that President Trump was to blame for the shutdown.A January 2019 poll conducted by telephone for CBS News found that 70% of Americans polled did not want a government shutdown over the issue of building a border wall; 66% believed that Trump should agree to a budget without wall funding.\n\nPresidency of Donald Trump Donald Trump January 2018 United

47,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018–2019 United States federal government shutdown', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The United States federal government shutdown from midnight EST on December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019 (35 days) was the longest government shutdown in history and the second and final federal government shutdown involving furloughs during the presidency of Donald Trump.It occurred when the 115th Congress and Trump could not agree on an appropriations bill to fund the operations of the federal government for the 2019 fiscal year, or a temporary continuing resolution that would extend the deadline for passing a bill.The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal departments or agencies from conducting non-essential operations without appropriations legislation in place.As a result, nine executive departments with around 800,000 employees had to shut down partially or in full, affecting about one-fourth of government activities and causing employees to be furloughed or required to work without being paid.The Congressional Budget Office estimated the shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion USD, excluding indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.\n\nThe shutdown stemmed from an impasse over Trump\'s demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall.In December 2018, the Senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the bill appeared likely to be approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Trump.After Trump faced heavy criticism from some right-wing media outlets and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to ""build the wall"", he announced that he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund its construction.As a result, the House passed a stopgap bill with funding for the wall, but it was blocked in the Senate by the threat of a Democratic filibuster.\n\nIn January 2019, representatives elected in the November 2018 election took office, giving the Democrats a majority in the House.The House immediately voted to approve the appropriations bill that had previously passed the Senate unanimously (which included no funding for the wall).For several weeks, Trump continued to maintain that he would veto any bill that did not fund an entire border wall, and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the Senate from considering any appropriations legislation that Trump would not support, including the bill that had previously passed.Democrats and some Republicans opposed the shutdown and passed multiple bills to reopen the government, arguing that the government shutdown amounted to ""hostage-taking"" civil servants and that negotiations could only begin once the government was reopened.\n\nOn January 25, 2019, Trump agreed to endorse a stopgap bill to reopen the government for three weeks up until February 15 to allow for negotiations to take place to approve an appropriations bill that both parties could agree on.However, Trump reiterated his demand for the border wall funding and said that he would shut down the government again or declare a national emergency and use military funding to build the wall if Congress did not appropriate the funds by February 15.\n\nTrump\'s approval rating dropped during the shutdown.A majority of Americans opposed exploitation of the shutdown as a negotiating strategy and held Trump responsible for the shutdown: A CBS News poll found that 71% of Americans considered the border wall ""not worth the shutdown"" and a Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 53% of Americans blamed Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, compared to 34% who blamed Democrats and 10% who blamed both parties.\n\nOn February 15, 2019, Trump declared a national emergency to fund the wall and bypass Congress, after being unsatisfied with a bipartisan border bill that had passed the House and the Senate a day before.\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign, then-candidate Trump promised to build a wall along the Mexico–United States border for which Mexico would pay.The president of Mexico rejected the idea of providing any funding for a U.S. border wall.In 2018, Trump requested $ in federal funding for some of barrier on the border, mostly to replace of aging fence built under the Secure Fence Act of 2006.On December 25, 2018, Trump reversed course, suggesting that he might accept of either mostly refurbished barrier (rather than new barriers in locations that did not previously have them) by November 2020.Trump\'s proposals and public statements on the wall have shifted widely over time, with varied proposals as to the design, material, length, height, and width of a wall.\n\nIn September 2018, Congress passed two ""minibus"" appropriations bills for the 2019 United States federal budget, which began on October 1, 2018.These bills combined five of the 12 regular appropriations bills covering 77% of federal discretionary funding, and included a continuing resolution until December 7 for the remaining agencies.On December 6, Congress passed a second continuing resolution to December 21, to give more time for negotiations on Trump\'s proposed border wall, which had been delayed due to the funeral of George H. W. Bush.\n\nA Senate Homeland Security appropriations bill, negotiated by both parties and reported by the committee to the Senate, provided for $ for border security, including funds for ""approximately 65 miles of pedestrian fencing along the southwest border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector"".The bill did not receive a vote on the Senate floor, although House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer indicated that such a proposal could be acceptable to House Democrats.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said the Democratic Party would not support $ for the border wall.At a press conference before the government shutdown, he noted ""the $1.6 billion for border security negotiated by Democrats and Republicans is our position.We believe that is the right way to go.""\n\nOn December 11, President Trump held a televised meeting with Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in the Oval Office and asked them to support an appropriation of $5.7 billion for funding of a border wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico.They refused, resulting in an argument between Trump and both Congressional leaders.During the contentious discussion, Trump remarked, ""I am proud to shut down the government for border security ...I will be the one to shut [the government] down.I\'m not going to blame you for it ...I will take the mantle.I will be the one to shut it down.""Schumer replied, ""We shouldn\'t shut down the government over a dispute.""Ten days later, Trump blamed Democrats for the impending shutdown.\n\nThree days later, Politico reported that Trump was willing to sign a bill with no funding for a border wall that delayed a government shutdown into 2019 and the new Congress.On December 18, following a meeting with Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the government would not shut down on December 22 and that Trump was ""flexible"" over funding for a border wall.Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby commented that the most likely resolution was a bill that funded the government until early February.Schumer added that his caucus would ""very seriously"" consider such a bill and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said ""I don\'t know anybody on the Hill that wants a shutdown, and I think all the president\'s advisers are telling him this would not be good.""\n\nOn December 19, the Senate passed a second continuing resolution () that would fund the government until February 8, 2019.Pelosi announced that House Democrats would support the measure, meaning it would overcome opposition from conservative Republicans and pass the House.On December 20, following increased criticism from conservative media, pundits, and political figures, Trump reversed his position and declared that he would not sign any funding bill that did not include border wall funding.The same day, the House passed a continuing resolution that included $5 billion for the wall and $8 billion in disaster aid.This bill failed in the Senate.Trump\'s changing position caused consternation among Senate Republicans.\n\nThe shutdown started December 22 and Trump announced that he would cancel his planned trip to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas and stay in Washington, D.C.The meaning of the term ""wall"" was expected to be an aspect of the negotiations.\n\nCongress adjourned on December 22 for the Christmas and holiday season, with many predicting that the shutdown would not be resolved until the start of the 116th Congress.The Senate reconvened on December 27 for four minutes, with Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) presiding over the session.The House briefly reconvened as well, with Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) saying that members should not expect any further votes for the rest of 2018.Representative Jim McGovern (D-MA) went to the House floor to try to force consideration of a short-term funding bill to end the shutdown that the Senate had already passed, but the Republican Speaker-pro-tem refused to let him speak.\n\nCongress then adjourned again until December 31, 2018, for a pro forma session.On January 2, 2019, the last full day of the 115th United States Congress, there was a pro forma session scheduled to last several minutes.\n\nThe new Congress was sworn in on January 3, 2019, and one of the first orders of business in the House after electing the Speaker and swearing in the new members was a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security until February 8 (), which passed by a vote of 239–192; and a package combining five appropriation bills funding the rest of the government for the remainder of the fiscal year (), passed by a vote of 241–190.The bills contained $1.3 billion of funding for border security, but no additional funding for a border wall.\n\nBeginning on January 9, the Democratic-controlled House voted on four appropriations bills individually:\n\nFinancial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Treasury (including the Internal Revenue Service), federal judiciary, District of Columbia, and a number of independent agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, General Services Administration, and Securities and Exchange Commission.The House passed the legislation on January 9, on a 240–188 vote, with every Democrat and eight Republicans voting yes, and all other Republicans voting no. Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Department of Agriculture (including food stamps), the Food and Drug Administration, and related entities.On January 10, the House passed this bill 243–183.Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore Transportation and Housing and Urban Development (including some federal mortgage programs).On January 10, the House passed this bill 244–180.Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Interior Department, Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies, including the Smithsonian Institution.On January 11, ten House Republicans voted with Democrats in a 240–179 vote to end the shutdown of Interior-Environment programs.It was the most recent of a ""series of standalone appropriations measures"" the House sent to the Senate.\n\nThis strategy has been compared to one used by Republicans during the 2013 shutdown in the form of a series of fourteen mini-continuing resolutions.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed that the Senate would not consider the House bills to reopen the government, indicating that Senate Republicans would not support any bill unless it had Trump\'s support.In January 2019, McConnell and Senate Republicans came under increased pressure to break the impasse and reopen the government.Three Republican Senators—Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Cory Gardner of Colorado—called for an end to the shutdown.Senators Collins and Gardner said they supported the House\'s budget bills to end the shutdown.West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito said that she could support ending the shutdown provided border wall talks continued.Pat Roberts of Kansas said that shutdowns ""never work"" and only turned affected federal workers into ""pawns"" and that, although the time had not yet come for Senate Republicans to override any possible Trump veto and end the shutdown, ""we\'re getting pretty close.""Johnny Isakson of Georgia echoed that sentiment, saying that support for McConnell\'s refusal to support bills that do not include funding for a wall would not last indefinitely: ""There\'s a time when that may run out.""\n\nOn January 16, McConnell again blocked the House appropriation bills to reopen the government from being considered on the Senate floor.The following day, McConnell blocked consideration of bills to reopen most of the closed government agencies for a third time.On January 23, McConnell blocked a bill to reopen most of the government for the fourth time.\n\nOn January 22, McConnell stated that the Senate would be voting on two different bills to end the shutdown on January 24.The first vote is on a bill to reopen the government which includes Trump\'s proposal to provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and temporary protections to some immigration classes.The other bill is a three-week continuing resolution to fund 25% of the government through February 8.\n\nOn January 22, Senator Mark Warner introduced a bill to keep the federal government running in the event of future shutdown events.The bill is called the ""Stop Shutdowns Transferring Unnecessary Pain and Inflicting Damage in the Coming Years Act"" or the ""Stop STUPIDITY Act"".\n\nOn January 24, the Senate held two votes on competing Democratic and Republican proposals to end the shutdown.The Democratic proposal was largely similar to the measure that had previously passed the Senate unanimously in the 115th Congress, and then been passed by the Democratic-controlled House in the 116th Congress.It provided funding for the government with no money for the border wall.The Republican proposal incorporated Trump\'s proposal, which would fund a border wall; temporarily extend TPS and DACA for three years, but would substantially narrow eligibility for DACA; and make significant legal changes to make it more difficult for persons escaping violence and persecution to be granted asylum in the United States.Neither proposal was able to attain the 60 votes needed for passage.The Trump plan failed in a 50–47 vote.The Democratic plan failed in a 52–44 vote.Most Republicans voted for Trump\'s plan and against the Democratic plan.Most Democrats voted for the Democratic plan and against Trump\'s plan.Republicans Tom Cotton and Mike Lee voted against both plans.Democrat Joe Manchin and Republicans Lamar Alexander, Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, Johnny Isakson, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney voted for both plans.Not voting on either were Republicans Rand Paul and Jim Risch and Democrat Jacky Rosen.Republican Richard Burr voted for Trump\'s plan and did not vote on the Democratic plan.\n\nOn January 25, House Democrats prepared a compromise proposal to reopen the government, which would provide $5 billion for border security but no wall construction.However, the shutdown ended the same day.\n\nOn January 4, after the new Congress was sworn-in and Pelosi regained the speakership, she and Schumer, as well as congressional Republican leadership met with Trump at the White House.Pelosi and Schumer argued that the shutdown needed to end and reported that Trump refused.They said that Trump threatened to ""keep the government closed for a very long period of time.Months or even years.""Later that day, Trump admitted to ""absolutely"" making that threat, adding, ""I\'m very proud of doing what I\'m doing.""Trump then said that he was considering declaring a national emergency to use military funding for the wall.At the meeting, Trump reprimanded his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney for attempting to propose a compromise between Trump\'s $5.7 billion demand for a border wall and the Democrats\' proposal of $1.3 billion for border security.\n\nTrump addressed the nation from the Oval Office at 9 p.m. EST on January 8, in a nationally televised address broadcast on both network and cable television.In his speech, Trump asserted that there was a ""growing humanitarian and security crisis"" on the Mexico–United States border that could only be solved by appropriating $5.7 billion for construction of a steel wall.Trump did not make any new proposals in his speech to break the impasse.Immediately after Trump\'s speech, Schumer and Pelosi delivered a response on behalf of the Democrats, in which they demanded an end to the shutdown and said: ""President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government.""\n\nTrump met with congressional leadership again on January 9, in a meeting lasting 14 minutes.Trump asked Pelosi, ""Will you agree to my wall?"" and when she replied that she would not, Trump said ""bye-bye"" and walked out of the meeting, later declaring it ""a total waste of time"".Schumer accused Trump of throwing a ""temper tantrum"" and slamming his hands on the table.Trump rebuked Schumer\'s comments on Twitter.Vice President Mike Pence and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that Trump remained calm and never raised his voice.On January 10, Pelosi described the preceding day\'s meeting with Trump as ""a setup"" staged by White House aides so that Trump could walk out of the meeting.Pelosi described Trump as ""un-presidential""; accused him of ""exploiting this situation in a way that enhances his power""; and said: ""I don\'t think he really wants a solution.I think he loves the distraction.""\n\nAfter Trump walked out of the January 9 meeting with congressional Democratic leaders, no further negotiations were conducted.Several Republican senators met in the office of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, after the meeting to discuss a compromise to end the shutdown.They discussed agreeing to Trump\'s demand for border wall funding and offering the Democrats help for Dreamers, refugee protections and extensions to H-2B visas.On January 13, Graham proposed that Trump agree to a congressional vote to reopen the government pending the resumption of negotiations.Graham suggested that if Trump and congressional Democrats did not come to an agreement at that time, Trump could declare a national emergency.Trump rejected this proposal the next day.\n\nOn January 19, Trump proposed a temporary extension of the two programs that protect about 700,000 immigrants from deportation—Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)—in exchange for funding for the border wall.The protections would be temporary, with no path to citizenship.Trump had previously revoked TPS for people from a number of Latin American and African countries, and taken steps to rescind DACA.In his remarks at the White House, Trump referred to a ""barrier"" rather than a ""wall"" and indicated that he aimed to erect ""steel barriers in high priority locations"" rather than ""a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea.""\n\nIn addition to funding a border wall, the 1,300-page Republican bill released after Trump made his proposal would make major changes to U.S. immigration policy (which were not included in Trump\'s public announcement).The legislation would severely restrict the ability of children from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to apply for asylum in the United States.Specifically, participation in the Central American Minors Program would be subject to an annual cap and migrant children would be barred from applying for asylum in person at the border, and only migrant children with a ""qualified"" parent in the U.S. would be eligible to apply.The bill would also create a new, more burdensome application process for TPS holders, and would exclude TPS holders from Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen.The American Immigration Lawyers Association government relations director said that the proposal ""would categorically block tens of thousands of children from ever applying for asylum,"" while a Cato Institute immigration analyst wrote that the proposal would not extend DACA, but rather replace it with ""a totally different program that will exclude untold thousands of Dreamers who would have been eligible under DACA.""\n\nDemocrats rejected Trump\'s proposal.In a speech on the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""The president\'s proposal is one-sided, harshly partisan and was made in bad faith.The asylum changes are a poison pill, if there ever was one.""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said extending the DACA proposal temporarily was ""unacceptable"" and a ""non-starter"" because it did not ""represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people\'s lives.""Analysts pointed out that Trump had previously rejected a deal that would have provided funding for the border wall in exchange for further protection for DACA recipients.Conversely, Republicans reacted positively to Trump\'s proposal, and Mitch McConnell said he would bring it to a vote in the Senate.\n\nDuring the shutdown, on January 8 in a press conference, a reporter asked Trump if he was considering declaring a national emergency, to which Trump replied, ""I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want"" and suggested that he could declare an emergency.After this, Trump repeatedly threatened to declare a national emergency to unilaterally order wall construction without congressional authorization.Some of Trump\'s advisors, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, reportedly attempted to dissuade him from doing so.Administration officials considered diverting hurricane-relief and wildfire-relief funds from a $13.9 billion February 2018 emergency supplemental appropriations bill (for disaster relief in Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California, among other places) in order to fund a wall, and directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to look into this possibility.\n\nAn attempt by Trump to invoke emergency powers would almost certainly have prompted a lengthy legal challenge in court.Democrats responded that Trump lacked the authority to declare a national emergency; Representative Adam Schiff called it a ""non-starter"" and said that ""if Harry Truman couldn\'t nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this President doesn\'t have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion dollar wall on the border.""Democratic Representative Nydia Velázquez said the notion of redirecting disaster-relief funds to a border wall was ""beyond appalling"".Presidents have declared emergencies in the past, but none has ""involved funding a policy goal after failing to win congressional approval"".Yale Law School professor Bruce Ackerman wrote that the declaration of a national emergency to build a wall as Trump suggested would be unconstitutional and illegal.Other scholars, such as Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice, believed that Trump could make a colorable argument that diverting military-construction appropriations for border-wall construction was legal, but that doing so would be an abuse of power.Law professor Ilya Somin stated that in the unlikely case that Trump succeeded in using the emergency powers in this way, it would set a dangerous precedent, which Republicans would come to regret next time the president was a Democrat.\n\nOn January 11, Trump—while maintaining he has the authority to do so anytime—said he was not in any rush to declare a national emergency to secure wall funding, saying he would rather see Congress ""do its job"" and that the Democrats ""should come back and vote.""The next day he again threatened to use emergency powers if Democrats did not ""come to their senses.""\n\nOn January 16, Pelosi sent a letter to Trump that indicated the House would be unavailable for the 2019 State of the Union Address that was scheduled for January 29.Pelosi wrote, ""Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government reopens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has reopened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on Jan. 29.""The delivery of the State of the Union address had been delayed or substantially changed on only two occasions since 1913.In a letter sent to the Speaker the next day, Trump said she would not be allowed to take military transport aircraft on scheduled visits to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan.Trump replied, ""We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the shutdown is over.""Pelosi and a congressional delegation had planned on visiting overseas American military personnel.\n\nOn January 23, Trump sent a letter to Pelosi insisting that there were no security concerns and that he would hold the State of the Union Address as scheduled.Trump wrote, ""Therefore, I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and Congress of the United States of America regarding the State of our Union.""In a letter sent in reply, Pelosi stated that the House would not consider a concurrent resolution to authorize the State of the Union Address in the House Chamber until the shutdown ended, writing, ""Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened.""\n\nTrump later stated he would look for an alternative, but then retracted that statement in a pair of tweets announcing that he would wait until the end of the shutdown to give the address in the House Chamber.\n\nOn January 25, Trump announced his support for a three-week funding measure that would reopen the government until February 15.The deal, which also moved forward with long-term Department of Homeland Security funding, did not include funds for a wall.As expected, the agreement provided federal employees with back pay.Both the Senate and House of Representatives passed the funding measure by voice vote, sending the resolution to the President\'s desk.Trump signed the bill the same day, ending the shutdown.\n\nLater in January, Republican senators voted unanimously against a bill to provide back pay to federal contractors.\n\nWithout legislation enacted by February 15, a new partial shutdown would have begun, three weeks after the last ended.A bipartisan group of senators and representatives reached an agreement ""in principle"" on February 11, but Trump did not say whether he would sign it.Included was $1.375 billion for 55 miles of steel border fencing.On February 13, it was reported that, against the wishes of Democratic leaders and many Republicans, Trump was blocking the provision of back pay to federal contractors who were still out of pocket from the shutdown.Both houses passed the bill February 14 with enough votes to override a veto if that happened.\n\nOn February 15, at the White House Rose Garden, Trump announced that he had signed the spending bill to keep the government open.He also declared a national emergency, hoping to get access to $8 billion to use for border security.\n\nAgencies funded by two ""minibus"" appropriations bills passed in September 2018 were not affected by the shutdown.About 380,000 federal employees were furloughed, and an additional 420,000 employees for the affected agencies were expected to work with their pay delayed until the end of the shutdown, totaling 800,000 workers affected out of 2.1 million civilian non-postal federal employees.As only about a quarter of the government was shut down, many people who are not federal employees did not fully realize the effects of the shutdown.\n\nAccording to and , these were the affected agencies:\n\nDepartment of State Department of the Treasury Department of Justice Most of the Department of the Interior Department of Agriculture Department of Commerce Department of Housing and Urban Development Department of Transportation Department of Homeland Security Some Department of Health and Human Services agencies Food and Drug Administration Indian Health Service Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Superfund Research Program Executive Office of the President Most independent agencies Judicial Branch\n\nUnaffected agencies include, according to and :\n\nDepartment of Defense Department of Labor Most of the Department of Health and Human Services Department of Energy Department of Education Department of Veterans Affairs Some Department of the Interior agencies Bureau of Reclamation Central Utah Project District of Columbia (excluding courts) Legislative Branch Social Security Administration Nuclear Regulatory Commission Appalachian Regional Commission Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board Delta Regional Authority Denali Commission Northern Border Regional Commission Southeast Crescent Regional Commission Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board American Battle Monuments Commission U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Cemeterial Expenses of the Army, including Arlington National Cemetery and Soldiers\' and Airmen\'s Home National Cemetery Armed Forces Retirement Home Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System Fund Intelligence Community Management Account Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled Corporation for National and Community Service Corporation for Public Broadcasting Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission Institute of Museum and Library Services Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission Medicare Payment Advisory Commission National Council on Disability National Labor Relations Board National Mediation Board Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission Railroad Retirement Board\n\nJobs affected included staff throughout the United States, not just DC area employees.FBI agents, federal corrections officers, FDA inspectors, NASA employees, TSA staff, Border Patrol staff and CBP officers, census staff, National Park Service staff, members of the Coast Guard, and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers either worked without pay or were furloughed, with increasing numbers of unpaid essential employees failing to show up for work.\n\nOn January 11, 800,000 workers for agencies shutdown or furloughed missed their first paycheck.Federal workers normally receive pay on federal holidays, which include Christmas, New Year\'s Day and potentially Martin Luther King Jr. Day.The shutdown affected the employees\' entitlement to paid holidays due to the shutdown.Unemployment assistance to federal workers furloughed under the government shutdown varied by locality.Only non-reporting workers were eligible for assistance, whereas furloughed workers who still reported to work were not.Workers who received unemployment assistance were required pay it back after the shut down ended and they received backpay.Some furloughed workers sought other employment opportunities while they were idled.However, external employment must meet agency-specific ethics guidelines, and mandatory reviews of external employment were also curtailed as most ethics officials were also furloughed.Federal employees were not able to use vacation or sick leave during the shutdown so scheduled holiday vacation time either became unpaid if the worker was deemed non-essential or was cancelled if the worker was deemed essential.In many cases unused leave over a certain threshold expired at year-end, but employees who had leave scheduled in advance of the shutdown did not have ""use or lose"" leave balances deducted from their accrued leave.Many furloughed employees took to crowd-funding campaigns to raise cash to replace missed paychecks, but these types of solicitations also run afoul of government ethics rules.\n\nAs furloughed federal workers and their families shared stories of their hardships, such as not being able to meet rent or mortgage payments and missed bills, the hashtag ""#ShutdownStories"" went viral on social media.The federal government\'s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) responded by publishing sample letters that employees could send to their creditors.One read, in part, ""I am a Federal employee who has recently been furloughed due to a lack of funding of my agency.Because of this, my income has been severely cut and I am unable to pay the entire cost of my mortgage, along with my other expenses.""Other federal workers reached out to other news outlets to share stories about having to stretch their budgets and the impact of the shutdown on their families.In addition to being unable to meet rent or pay bills, many federal workers around the country were unable to pay for groceries and turned to food banks.One federal prison guard in Louisiana attempted suicide after posting about the financial pressures of the shutdown on Facebook.\n\nThe OPM also suggested that employees who had landlords write: ""I would like to discuss with you the possibility of trading my services to perform maintenance (e.g. painting, carpentry work) in exchange for partial rent payments"" and suggested those who lacked funds to pay bills should hire personal attorneys to assist them.Other organizations also posted advice on how to ""find supplemental income""; the Coast Guard suggested that Coast Guard members ""have a garage sale, offer to watch children, walk pets or house sit"" while furloughed.\n\nOn January 4, The Washington Post reported that because the shutdown was triggered by the failure to enact spending bills that continued a federal government pay freeze, hundreds of senior Trump administration political appointees would receive a roughly $10,000 pay raise the following day.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the pending pay raise was an ""unnecessary byproduct of the shutdown.""\n\nOn January 10, the Senate approved by unanimous consent a bill (S.24, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019) providing that furloughed federal employees would receive back pay for the period of the furlough once appropriations were restored; the bill was approved the next day by the House on a vote of 411–7.Trump signed the bill into law on January 16.\n\nNative American tribes were not paid for treaties negotiated with the United States government.These treaties specified that the federal government must provide funding for health clinics, employee salaries, education, infrastructure and other services, which were not paid during the shutdown.Native lands are ""owned, managed and maintained by the federal government.""Native Americans who receive a per capita check for profits from oil and gas sales from tribal land did not receive check for the month of February.Roads were not plowed on tribal land, and some areas received significant snowfall.This caused people of the Navajo Nation to become trapped inside their homes.Food services, which fed 90,000 Native Americans in 2017, were halted.\n\nNative American communities had a high percentage of individuals who worked for the federal government and lost income during the shutdown.In North and South Dakota, one of the largest employers is the Indian Health Service.The Chippewa tribe reported an economic loss of nearly $100,000 daily in funds that the federal government was supposed to provide as a treaty obligation.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was closed for the shutdown.However, 60 percent of the Indian Health Service (IHS) continued to work without pay.IHS provides care for 2.2 million Native Americans and on January 23, began to deny care that was not considered ""life threatening.""The Bureau of Indian Education was able to stay open because it was funded on a different schedule.Unlike other government shutdowns, there was little outreach from the Trump Administration to Native Americans and the Chippewa tribe in Michigan was given a 24-hour notice that the shutdown would take place and affect the tribe.\n\nThe only military branch that was affected by the shutdown was the Coast Guard because it was part of the Department of Homeland Security, while the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps were all funded through the Department of Defense.Officials were able to fund payment on December 31, 2018, but were not able to do so for the paychecks of January 15 and 30, 2019, along with the pay and benefits for civilian workers and retirees.During the shutdown, the Coast Guard continued to engage in patrolling the American coastline and carrying out overseas missions in locations such as the Persian Gulf along with the Navy and in the Caribbean.Other issues arose in the payment processes for Coast Guard members Tricare Health and Dental Program payments, although the individuals were still covered.\n\nMilitary schools, such as the Coast Guard Academy and the National War College, lost funding due to the shutdown and the schools had to work to find funds to pay professors.\n\nAlthough the Department of Defense was not shut down, the February 4, 2019, date for release of the Pentagon\'s 2020 budget was delayed by at least one month.This had repercussions on the interim period which is usually used by Pentagon planners for adjustments before the 2020 fiscal year which will begin in October 2019.The White House Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the Pentagon request, was shut down when the Pentagon budget arrived in December, and remained inactive, so no work was done on the budget.\n\nOn February 25, 2019, the Pentagon\'s counter-drug (interdiction) funding has up to $85 million not yet obligated, but that money was planned for the known corridors in El Paso, Tucson, Yuma, and El Centro for border fencing, lighting, and road projects, so any funds which might possibly be intended for additional projects elsewhere along the border must be obligated by September 30, 2019, in order not to affect the known corridors.Otherwise appropriations above the $85 million not yet obligated for additional interdiction border projects will have to be approved by additional Congressional appropriations, to reach the $2 billion target.\n\nA January 28, 2019 Congressional Budget Office report estimated that the 35-day partial government shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion, including $3 billion in permanent losses; the CBO estimate excluded indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.The furloughing of 145,000 federal workers and 112,500 federal contractors in the Washington Metropolitan Area cost the regional economy $119 million each day, or 7.3% of the region\'s total output.That reduced GDP by over $2.8 billion in the Washington DC area alone.The shutdown also had a noticeable impact on hunger in the national capital region: food pantries in Washington DC and Northern Virginia reported an increase of around 10% in the number of people coming to pick up groceries, with most of that increase coming from federal workers and contractors.\n\nFitch Ratings warned that an extended shutdown might lead to a downgrade in the U.S.\'s Triple-A credit rating if lawmakers were unable to pass a budget or manage the debt ceiling.That in turn would make borrowing more costly for companies and American households, because it is the benchmark for many other lines of credit.The only time the U.S. credit rating has been downgraded by S&P was during the United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011.\n\nSome economists believed that an extended shutdown would weaken consumer confidence and heighten the risk of pushing the U.S. economy into a recession.Between 800,000 federal government employees and some 4 million federal contractors, the shutdown directly affected nearly 3% of the labor force of the United States; in a typical recession, unemployment increases 2–4%.The reduction in spending by those households combined with the reduction of government services could have macroeconomic results similar to a typical recession.The shutdown had an adverse effect on the budgets of state and local governments, as states covered some federal services (particularly the most vulnerable) during the shutdown.\n\nBy mid-January 2019, the White House Council of Economic Advisors estimated that each week of the shutdown reduced GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, the equivalent of 1.2 points per quarter.CEA chairman Kevin Hassett later acknowledged that GDP growth could decline to zero in the first quarter of 2019 if the shutdown lasted the entire quarter.\n\nAs tax season began in the United States on January 28, some 46,000 Internal Revenue Service workers were called back to work to ensure tax refunds and returns were not affected by the shutdown.The recalled workers allowed the department to continue operations that were automatic and those deemed necessary for the safety of human life or protection of government property, such as processing electronic returns, returns with payments, mailing tax forms, appeals, criminal law enforcement investigations and technical support.\n\nDuring the shutdown, 95% of federal staff for the USDA\'s Food and Nutrition Services were furloughed.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the food-stamp program, could be funded through a $3 billion contingency fund appropriated by Congress in 2018; if the shutdown had continued through March 2019, those funds would have been exhausted, leaving some 38 million Americans without food stamps and endangering food security.Concerns were raised that continuation of the shutdown could delay the issuance of some $140 billion in tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees most of the food supply in the U.S.In early January, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner, reported that the FDA suspended food inspections.He noted that inspection of foreign food was continuing as ""almost normal,"" because they are considered vital.Around January 14, ""high-risk"" food inspections resumed.As of January 22, 2019, 46 percent of the FDA were working, though 20 percent of them were working without pay.During the shutdown, two new recalls for contamination with Listeria or Salmonella took place.Consumer advocacy groups advised of food safety issues during the shutdown.Food safety attorney, Bill Marler, advocated against eating ""fresh, uncooked products on the market place.""Because there was a shortage of FDA inspectors, many imported perishable items, such as produce or flowers, were at risk of spoilage.Meat and some egg products are inspected by the USDA\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service.Federal legislation required those inspectors to remain working without pay.\n\nSchool administrations raised concern about how to feed children who purchase food at the schools for lunch, as funding concerns caused some districts to conserve food and funding.Many limited the amount or variation of foods available for the children to purchase, and alerted parents to the concerns and the limited availability of some of the items.Most schools affected were in high-poverty areas, and depended on federally funded lunch programs, such as the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) a federal grant established by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 and operated through the Department of Agriculture.Some 22 million students in nearly 100,000 schools received school meals through that operation.\n\nAs with the January 2018 shutdown, national parks were expected to be open to the extent practical, though there would be no staff and buildings would be closed.The shutdown affected national parks unevenly, some were accessible with bare-bones staffing levels, some operated with money from states or charitable groups, and others were locked off.Diane Regas, president and chief executive of the Trust for Public Land, called upon Trump to close all national parks to protect the public: by the third week of the shutdown, three people had died in national parks.This number was reported as being within \'usual\' levels.At Yosemite National Park, on January 4, 2019, a death from a fall went unreported for a week.\n\nBy January 1, 2019, the problems of neglected trash pileup, overflowing public toilets, and access to first aid were repeated across the Park system.Health and safety concerns were raised, with concerns by scientists that the expansive amount of garbage and human waste could impact water and soil quality, or cause damage to animals in the parks.Other issues that arose due to the shutdown included illegal campsites, protected agriculture being damaged, damaging of government property and trespassing on foot and by vehicle.\n\nNew York kept the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open, as it did during the January 2018 shutdown.Arizona and Utah were able to keep Grand Canyon National Park, Zion National Park, Arches National Park, and Bryce Canyon National Park open and provided services including public restrooms, shuttles and trash collection.Utah\'s funding included visitor centers.The sites closed outright in the southwest alone included Bandelier National Monument and Valles Caldera National Preserve in northern New Mexico, White Sands National Monument in southern New Mexico, Petrified Forest National Park in northern Arizona and Casa Grande Ruins National Monument in south-central Arizona.Access to major parts of Sequoia and Kings Canyon parks were closed, and at Joshua Tree National Park, the administration policy of leaving parks open to visitors despite the staff furloughs resulted in park damage, including the toppling of protected trees.In Texas, Big Bend National Park had no visitor services, such as restrooms.Some trailheads were closed.Regulations continued to be enforced, as the park remained open.Visitors were reminded to remove their own trash and toilet paper.The Alamo remained open but no NPS services were available at the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park.Channel Islands National Park remained open to public access, although services normally provided by the national park service were instead provided by Island Packers Cruises, the company normally in charge of ferries to the islands.\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration closed immediately on December 22, 2018.The Library of Congress, the U.S. Botanic Garden, the Capitol Visitor Center, and the U.S. Capitol Building remained open as they were funded by the 2019 Legislative Branch appropriations bill.The Smithsonian Institution operated on ""prior-year funds"" through January 1, 2019.On January 2, 2019, the Smithsonian Institution initiated an orderly shutdown of all its facilities, including 19 museums in Washington, D.C., and New York City, the National Zoo, and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.The following day, the National Gallery of Art was closed.The National Zoo also closed on January 3, 2019.Tourism attendance on the National Mall was affected.On January 5, 2019, acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt directed the diversion of fee revenue defined by the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to be used to fund minimal maintenance activities so as to preserve access to highly visited parks.\n\nAccording to a January 12, 2019, article in The Economist, on January 11, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was unable to pay its workers who had not been paid since December 22; 55% more of them called in sick than in January 2018.\n\nAs the air traffic controllers were deemed essential employees, they were required to work without pay.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents air traffic controllers, filed a lawsuit against the federal government for the shutdown on January 11, 2019, claiming that requiring 16,000 air traffic controllers to work without being paid violated their constitutional rights and federal minimum wage law.That was the third lawsuit filed against the federal government since the beginning of the shutdown.\n\nAirline and aircraft safety inspectors, on the other hand, were deemed nonessential and furloughed.A news report on January 12, 2019, stated that the Federal Aviation Administration had returned 500 furloughed safety inspectors back to work and would return more to work in the following weeks.As the airline and aircraft safety inspectors were furloughed, the certification process of the Airbus A220 in the US was stalled.Delta Air Lines was forced to delay the launch of the new aircraft, and to use other models of aircraft to serve those routes that was supposed to be served with A220.Many TSA employees also called out sick, most of them because they were trying to find other jobs that would provide immediate paychecks.\n\nThe shutdown initially prevented the National Transportation Safety Board from assisting the Mexican government\'s investigation of the 2018 Puebla helicopter crash that killed a state governor and senator; an exception allowed the NTSB to assist with the Mexican government in the investigation along with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.The NTSB also had to delay several investigations until the government reopened and only continued investigations into accidents that were considered the most serious.Issues in receiving certification and oversight from the FAA led to a month-long delay in the commencement of passenger service at Paine Field in Everett, Washington.\n\nAs the shutdown continued into its fourth week, the unions representing airline pilots, flight attendants and air traffic controllers issued a statement asserting, ""we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play"" because of the shutdown.\n\nSome airports such as the Philadelphia International Airport, launched food and item donations for federal employees who were affected by the shutdown.Other airports such as the Miami International Airport, and the George Bush International Airport, closed down terminals in order to spread out the TSA workers that were available.\n\nOn January 25, flights destined for LaGuardia Airport in New York were halted to a groundstop by FAA officials due to staffing shortages directly as a result of the shutdown.As a result, several flights to and from neighboring airports in the Northeast, specifically Philadelphia and Newark, suffered significant delays of their own.Soon after that, appropriations passed and the government reopened.\n\nThe shutdown delayed software updates to the Boeing 737 MAX airplane which may have caused the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.\n\nDuring the shutdown, court-appointed private lawyers who represent indigent defendants worked without pay.The Federal Judiciary initially had a goal of sustaining paid operations through January 18, 2019.It said it would run out of money to sustain court operations no earlier than January 25, but perhaps as late as February 1.Failing funding, the Judiciary would operate under the terms of the Antideficiency Act.This Act does not allow federal agencies to expend federal funds before an appropriation, nor to accept any voluntary services.The judiciary had 33,000 employees nationwide.Under the Constitution, Supreme Court Justices, appeals court judges and district judges would continue to be paid.\n\nThe shutdown caused many delays and disruptions in cases.Budgets were watched carefully to be able to pay public defenders, DNA testing, informants, and travel costs to interview victims and witnesses.Staffing issues also brought about concerns and constraints with prisons lacking the staff to safely hold attorney-client visits, and caused a delay in bail hearings.\n\nAgents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed in a report released on January 22, 2019, by the FBI Agents Association, that several different investigations were compromised by the shutdown.The report was called ""Voices from the Field"" and was 72 pages long.FBI agents were unable to pay Confidential Human Sources which risks losing that informant permanently.Some FBI divisions no longer have Spanish-speaking staff on hand and could not work with informants who only speak Spanish.Some agents reported that they did not have the funds to assist in joint operations with local law enforcement.\n\nFederal law enforcement agencies working on Native American land worked without pay through the shutdown.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was forced to cancel a trip to the United States/Mexico border in early January due to the shutdown.DHS was also unable to inspect Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities during the shutdown to ensure that immigrants were being held in facilities appropriately.During the shutdown, the federal government\'s e-Verify system—a system for employers to check the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States—was halted.\n\nDuring the shutdown, a wave of Domain Name System (DNS) attacks on government sites was detected by Homeland Security.The attacks were serious because these Internet sites could be hijacked.\n\nOfficial websites for agencies were rendered insecure or inaccessible through the shutdown, as the expired digital certificates were not renewed.On January 23, DHS asked all government agencies to secure their DNS records; however, many agencies were not able to respond quickly to this request.\n\nExecutive and legislative affairs of the local government of the District of Columbia continued operating through the shutdown, due to a provision previously enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017.The District\'s local court system, including the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, are part of the federal judiciary.Thus, they were partially shut down, preventing District residents from accessing services such as marriage licensing.The District of Columbia government said it would take over trash collection and snow plowing operations for National Park Service facilities in Washington.\n\nThe shutdown also interfered with the response to the 2018 Sunda Strait tsunami, as the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta\'s Twitter account was unable to tweet updates, and the United States Geological Survey was unable to provide data on the tsunami.The American weather model, the GFS, suffered a significant drop in forecast quality when a data format change during the shutdown prevented certain weather data from being recognized by the GFS, and the shutdown prevented the bug from being corrected.\n\nBy mid-day Thursday, January 3, 2019, the FCC had suspended operations.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai canceled his trip to the Consumer Electronics Show.The FTC also suspended certain online operations.The EPA and Department of Energy\'s Energy Star website was not available for the duration of the shutdown.\n\nMakers of alcoholic beverages were unable to receive approval from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau for new labels and recipes during the shutdown.\n\nBased on the recalculation of their operating reserves, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) would have had to cease patent operations in the second week of February.A cadre of personnel was allocated to continue receiving patent applications, receive payments, and maintain the IT infrastructure.Even though the USPTO is self-funded, a Congressional appropriation is required to permit the USPTO to spend money.The pipeline of patent applications at the time took 15.8 months for a response from an examiner.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution shortened to two days and downscaled its scheduled ten-day 2019 Folklife Festival on the National Mall because of the shutdown\'s effects.Sabrina Motley, the director of the festival, said that initially, crucial funding for the June—July event arrived later than expected, slowing preparations.Motley stated: ""The government opened back up, but it took a while for systems to come back online. ...We looked at our production schedule, and it became clear we would need more time than we had.""\n\nThe White House residence staff who stage public receptions were among those furloughed, with a minimal staff continuing to work unpaid for the first family.In the midst of the shutdown Trump invited the Clemson Tigers football team to a White House dinner reception on January 14 in recognition of their College Football Playoff National Championship win.On the morning of the reception Trump announced that he intended to serve fast food hamburgers and pizza to the team, a remark that some commentators interpreted as a joke.That evening Trump welcomed the team in the State Dining Room with a buffet of fast food and pizza from McDonald\'s, Wendy\'s and other restaurant chains, which he stated that he had paid for personally.Trump served fast food to other visiting athletes later that year, after the shutdown had ended.\n\nOn January 10, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with several other unions, announced plans to protest the government shutdown at 1:00pm EST in Washington, DC.Leaders of the National Federation of Federal Employees stated they had hoped that bringing federal workers to the President\'s doorstep would show him that it was the individual workers that the shutdown was hurting the most.President Trump had left to visit the US–Mexican border in Texas earlier in the day.\n\nSimilar protests took place in Philadelphia and St. Louis, among other cities.On January 15, representatives for Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, and Vietnam Veterans of America along with others called for an end to shutdown, but avoided placing any blame on political parties.\n\nShortly after the protests, the American Federation of Government Employees sued the Trump administration to challenge the arrangements for work without pay during the shutdown.A similar suit was raised and won during the 2013 Federal Government shutdown.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association also sued the Trump administration, as the shutdown allegedly violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by failing to pay the workers at least a minimum wage during the shutdown.\n\nAs the salaries for members of Congress are written into permanent law and not funded through annual appropriations, the government shutdown did not affect their salaries.Senators and Representatives were still paid their biweekly salaries of $6,700 towards at least $174,000 a year.\n\nSeveral Democratic and Republican Senators and Representatives said they would donate or refuse their salary during the shutdown.Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw stated that he would refuse his salary, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto indicated she would donate hers to a Nevada charity, Senator Mazie Hirono said she would donate her salary to Hawaii food banks, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would give hers to refugee non-profit HIAS, New York Congressman Max Rose stated that he would give his salary to charity and outgoing Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota pledged hers to charity, along with her Republican colleague John Hoeven.Republican senator Kevin Cramer, who defeated Heidi Heitkamp in the 2018 midterm elections, refused to donate his salary, calling the move ""gimmicky"".Representative Brian Fitzpatrick urged all members of Congress to decline their paychecks.He said, ""If you\'re in Congress, don\'t just delay your pay -- forfeit it, write a check back to the US Treasury.Then you\'ll feel the pain of federal workers.""\n\nBy January 17, 2019, 102 members of Congress—20 Senators and 82 Representatives— chose to decline their paychecks or were donating their paychecks to charity.\n\nDuring the shutdown, many federal workers used food banks and food pantries in order to feed themselves and their families.Many food pantries waived certain restrictions in order to help government workers have access to food.During the shutdown, the Salvation Army Emergency Disasters Services program provided meals for federal workers.Chef Jose Andres created the #ChefsForFeds program to feed federal workers in Washington, D.C. and by January 21, made announcements to expand the program nationwide.\n\nSome states such as California, offered furloughed employees unemployment benefits, although the Trump administration allegedly told states that they could not do so with federal funds.Organizations such as state Attorney Generals offices, and credit card companies posted statements to their websites to offer a means to help to consolidate debt, meet mortgages or other payments such as child support or tuition.An employment law firm offered pro bono legal advice to furloughed federal employees.School districts opened up free or reduced lunch options for children of federal employees, and looked into other options to aid parents amid concerns that financial stress at home would adversely affect families and children.Every mainline denomination in America has contributed to efforts to provide relief.One Baptist church emptied its entire disaster fund to aid federal employees.\n\nOn January 24, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross downplayed the financial difficulties faced by the 800,000 federal workers affected by the shutdown, stating that they should borrow money to ""tide them over"" until the shutdown ends.Critics and Democrats criticized the statement as inappropriate, noting that Ross\' own net worth is estimated at almost $700 million, accusing him of being out of touch with the workers.Ross also said that he ""did not understand"" why people who were not getting paid due to the shutdown were visiting food banks.When asked about Ross\' statement, Trump suggested that grocery stores will ""work along"" with the government by voluntarily extending credit to those who are out of funds to buy food.National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow characterized the shutdown as a ""glitch"" and suggested that federal workers who were required to work without pay were ""volunteering"" to work for their love of the country and ""presumably their allegiance to President Trump.""\n\nIn a video message to staff, FBI director Christopher Wray stated, ""Making some people stay home when they don\'t want to, and making others show up without pay, it\'s mind-boggling, it\'s shortsighted and it\'s unfair.It takes a lot to get me angry, but I\'m about as angry as I\'ve been in a long, long time.""\n\nLara Trump, a daughter-in-law of the President, drew outrage after an interview in which she stated that while ""It\'s not fair to you..."" the shutdown was ""...a little bit of pain, but it\'s going to be for the future of our country, and their children and their grandchildren and generations after them will thank them for their sacrifice right now.""Her comments drew criticism by politicians, celebrities, and the general public who felt the advisor and spokeswoman for the Trump 2020 campaign was out of touch, however Lara Trump later claimed the comments were taken out of context.\n\nIn January 2019, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that 56% of the responding public opposed a wall while 39% favored it, and 45% viewed the situation at the border as a crisis.The numbers were similar to the poll in December 2018 yet a later poll by ABC News showed that as the partial shutdown entered its fourth week support for building a wall was increasing.A poll done through YouGov between December 23–25, 2018, reported that 51% of respondents thought Trump deserved ""a lot"" of the blame, 44% thought congressional Democrats and 39% thought congressional Republicans.Similar results were reported by a December 21–25 survey done by Reuters and Ipsos in which 47% of respondents said that the shutdown was the President\'s fault and 33% blamed Congressional Democrats.\n\nOver the course of the shutdown, Trump\'s approval rating marginally declined while his disapproval rating marginally increased.His net approval rating was by the middle of January 2019 at its lowest point since February 2018.On December 27, 2018, it was reported that Trump\'s approval rating of registered voters was at 39%, with 56% disapproval.Broken down the rating was split across party lines, with Republicans reporting an 80% approval rate while Democrats and independents reported a 90% and 57% disapproval rating, respectively.The poll was conducted through Morning Consult between December 21–23.The poll also reported that 43% of respondents blamed Trump for the shutdown, with 31% blaming congressional Democrats and 7% congressional Republicans.Another poll through The New York Times Upshot/Siena College reported that 89% of voters\' views on Trump and the wall were aligned, suggesting that support for the wall was a function of support for Trump.\n\nThe Washington Post–ABC News poll published on January 13, 2019, found that a larger number of Americans blamed Trump and congressional Republicans than congressional Democrats for the shutdown.A PBS NewsHour–Marist poll found that on January 15, 2019, a majority of Americans thought that President Trump was to blame for the shutdown.A January 2019 poll conducted by telephone for CBS News found that 70% of Americans polled did not want a government shutdown over the issue of building a border wall; 66% believed that Trump should agree to a budget without wall funding.\n\nPresidency of Donald Trump Donald Trump January 2018 United

48,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018–2019 United States federal government shutdown', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The United States federal government shutdown from midnight EST on December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019 (35 days) was the longest government shutdown in history and the second and final federal government shutdown involving furloughs during the presidency of Donald Trump.It occurred when the 115th Congress and Trump could not agree on an appropriations bill to fund the operations of the federal government for the 2019 fiscal year, or a temporary continuing resolution that would extend the deadline for passing a bill.The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal departments or agencies from conducting non-essential operations without appropriations legislation in place.As a result, nine executive departments with around 800,000 employees had to shut down partially or in full, affecting about one-fourth of government activities and causing employees to be furloughed or required to work without being paid.The Congressional Budget Office estimated the shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion USD, excluding indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.\n\nThe shutdown stemmed from an impasse over Trump\'s demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall.In December 2018, the Senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the bill appeared likely to be approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Trump.After Trump faced heavy criticism from some right-wing media outlets and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to ""build the wall"", he announced that he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund its construction.As a result, the House passed a stopgap bill with funding for the wall, but it was blocked in the Senate by the threat of a Democratic filibuster.\n\nIn January 2019, representatives elected in the November 2018 election took office, giving the Democrats a majority in the House.The House immediately voted to approve the appropriations bill that had previously passed the Senate unanimously (which included no funding for the wall).For several weeks, Trump continued to maintain that he would veto any bill that did not fund an entire border wall, and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the Senate from considering any appropriations legislation that Trump would not support, including the bill that had previously passed.Democrats and some Republicans opposed the shutdown and passed multiple bills to reopen the government, arguing that the government shutdown amounted to ""hostage-taking"" civil servants and that negotiations could only begin once the government was reopened.\n\nOn January 25, 2019, Trump agreed to endorse a stopgap bill to reopen the government for three weeks up until February 15 to allow for negotiations to take place to approve an appropriations bill that both parties could agree on.However, Trump reiterated his demand for the border wall funding and said that he would shut down the government again or declare a national emergency and use military funding to build the wall if Congress did not appropriate the funds by February 15.\n\nTrump\'s approval rating dropped during the shutdown.A majority of Americans opposed exploitation of the shutdown as a negotiating strategy and held Trump responsible for the shutdown: A CBS News poll found that 71% of Americans considered the border wall ""not worth the shutdown"" and a Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 53% of Americans blamed Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, compared to 34% who blamed Democrats and 10% who blamed both parties.\n\nOn February 15, 2019, Trump declared a national emergency to fund the wall and bypass Congress, after being unsatisfied with a bipartisan border bill that had passed the House and the Senate a day before.\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign, then-candidate Trump promised to build a wall along the Mexico–United States border for which Mexico would pay.The president of Mexico rejected the idea of providing any funding for a U.S. border wall.In 2018, Trump requested $ in federal funding for some of barrier on the border, mostly to replace of aging fence built under the Secure Fence Act of 2006.On December 25, 2018, Trump reversed course, suggesting that he might accept of either mostly refurbished barrier (rather than new barriers in locations that did not previously have them) by November 2020.Trump\'s proposals and public statements on the wall have shifted widely over time, with varied proposals as to the design, material, length, height, and width of a wall.\n\nIn September 2018, Congress passed two ""minibus"" appropriations bills for the 2019 United States federal budget, which began on October 1, 2018.These bills combined five of the 12 regular appropriations bills covering 77% of federal discretionary funding, and included a continuing resolution until December 7 for the remaining agencies.On December 6, Congress passed a second continuing resolution to December 21, to give more time for negotiations on Trump\'s proposed border wall, which had been delayed due to the funeral of George H. W. Bush.\n\nA Senate Homeland Security appropriations bill, negotiated by both parties and reported by the committee to the Senate, provided for $ for border security, including funds for ""approximately 65 miles of pedestrian fencing along the southwest border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector"".The bill did not receive a vote on the Senate floor, although House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer indicated that such a proposal could be acceptable to House Democrats.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said the Democratic Party would not support $ for the border wall.At a press conference before the government shutdown, he noted ""the $1.6 billion for border security negotiated by Democrats and Republicans is our position.We believe that is the right way to go.""\n\nOn December 11, President Trump held a televised meeting with Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in the Oval Office and asked them to support an appropriation of $5.7 billion for funding of a border wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico.They refused, resulting in an argument between Trump and both Congressional leaders.During the contentious discussion, Trump remarked, ""I am proud to shut down the government for border security ...I will be the one to shut [the government] down.I\'m not going to blame you for it ...I will take the mantle.I will be the one to shut it down.""Schumer replied, ""We shouldn\'t shut down the government over a dispute.""Ten days later, Trump blamed Democrats for the impending shutdown.\n\nThree days later, Politico reported that Trump was willing to sign a bill with no funding for a border wall that delayed a government shutdown into 2019 and the new Congress.On December 18, following a meeting with Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the government would not shut down on December 22 and that Trump was ""flexible"" over funding for a border wall.Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby commented that the most likely resolution was a bill that funded the government until early February.Schumer added that his caucus would ""very seriously"" consider such a bill and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said ""I don\'t know anybody on the Hill that wants a shutdown, and I think all the president\'s advisers are telling him this would not be good.""\n\nOn December 19, the Senate passed a second continuing resolution () that would fund the government until February 8, 2019.Pelosi announced that House Democrats would support the measure, meaning it would overcome opposition from conservative Republicans and pass the House.On December 20, following increased criticism from conservative media, pundits, and political figures, Trump reversed his position and declared that he would not sign any funding bill that did not include border wall funding.The same day, the House passed a continuing resolution that included $5 billion for the wall and $8 billion in disaster aid.This bill failed in the Senate.Trump\'s changing position caused consternation among Senate Republicans.\n\nThe shutdown started December 22 and Trump announced that he would cancel his planned trip to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas and stay in Washington, D.C.The meaning of the term ""wall"" was expected to be an aspect of the negotiations.\n\nCongress adjourned on December 22 for the Christmas and holiday season, with many predicting that the shutdown would not be resolved until the start of the 116th Congress.The Senate reconvened on December 27 for four minutes, with Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) presiding over the session.The House briefly reconvened as well, with Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) saying that members should not expect any further votes for the rest of 2018.Representative Jim McGovern (D-MA) went to the House floor to try to force consideration of a short-term funding bill to end the shutdown that the Senate had already passed, but the Republican Speaker-pro-tem refused to let him speak.\n\nCongress then adjourned again until December 31, 2018, for a pro forma session.On January 2, 2019, the last full day of the 115th United States Congress, there was a pro forma session scheduled to last several minutes.\n\nThe new Congress was sworn in on January 3, 2019, and one of the first orders of business in the House after electing the Speaker and swearing in the new members was a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security until February 8 (), which passed by a vote of 239–192; and a package combining five appropriation bills funding the rest of the government for the remainder of the fiscal year (), passed by a vote of 241–190.The bills contained $1.3 billion of funding for border security, but no additional funding for a border wall.\n\nBeginning on January 9, the Democratic-controlled House voted on four appropriations bills individually:\n\nFinancial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Treasury (including the Internal Revenue Service), federal judiciary, District of Columbia, and a number of independent agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, General Services Administration, and Securities and Exchange Commission.The House passed the legislation on January 9, on a 240–188 vote, with every Democrat and eight Republicans voting yes, and all other Republicans voting no. Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Department of Agriculture (including food stamps), the Food and Drug Administration, and related entities.On January 10, the House passed this bill 243–183.Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore Transportation and Housing and Urban Development (including some federal mortgage programs).On January 10, the House passed this bill 244–180.Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Interior Department, Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies, including the Smithsonian Institution.On January 11, ten House Republicans voted with Democrats in a 240–179 vote to end the shutdown of Interior-Environment programs.It was the most recent of a ""series of standalone appropriations measures"" the House sent to the Senate.\n\nThis strategy has been compared to one used by Republicans during the 2013 shutdown in the form of a series of fourteen mini-continuing resolutions.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed that the Senate would not consider the House bills to reopen the government, indicating that Senate Republicans would not support any bill unless it had Trump\'s support.In January 2019, McConnell and Senate Republicans came under increased pressure to break the impasse and reopen the government.Three Republican Senators—Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Cory Gardner of Colorado—called for an end to the shutdown.Senators Collins and Gardner said they supported the House\'s budget bills to end the shutdown.West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito said that she could support ending the shutdown provided border wall talks continued.Pat Roberts of Kansas said that shutdowns ""never work"" and only turned affected federal workers into ""pawns"" and that, although the time had not yet come for Senate Republicans to override any possible Trump veto and end the shutdown, ""we\'re getting pretty close.""Johnny Isakson of Georgia echoed that sentiment, saying that support for McConnell\'s refusal to support bills that do not include funding for a wall would not last indefinitely: ""There\'s a time when that may run out.""\n\nOn January 16, McConnell again blocked the House appropriation bills to reopen the government from being considered on the Senate floor.The following day, McConnell blocked consideration of bills to reopen most of the closed government agencies for a third time.On January 23, McConnell blocked a bill to reopen most of the government for the fourth time.\n\nOn January 22, McConnell stated that the Senate would be voting on two different bills to end the shutdown on January 24.The first vote is on a bill to reopen the government which includes Trump\'s proposal to provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and temporary protections to some immigration classes.The other bill is a three-week continuing resolution to fund 25% of the government through February 8.\n\nOn January 22, Senator Mark Warner introduced a bill to keep the federal government running in the event of future shutdown events.The bill is called the ""Stop Shutdowns Transferring Unnecessary Pain and Inflicting Damage in the Coming Years Act"" or the ""Stop STUPIDITY Act"".\n\nOn January 24, the Senate held two votes on competing Democratic and Republican proposals to end the shutdown.The Democratic proposal was largely similar to the measure that had previously passed the Senate unanimously in the 115th Congress, and then been passed by the Democratic-controlled House in the 116th Congress.It provided funding for the government with no money for the border wall.The Republican proposal incorporated Trump\'s proposal, which would fund a border wall; temporarily extend TPS and DACA for three years, but would substantially narrow eligibility for DACA; and make significant legal changes to make it more difficult for persons escaping violence and persecution to be granted asylum in the United States.Neither proposal was able to attain the 60 votes needed for passage.The Trump plan failed in a 50–47 vote.The Democratic plan failed in a 52–44 vote.Most Republicans voted for Trump\'s plan and against the Democratic plan.Most Democrats voted for the Democratic plan and against Trump\'s plan.Republicans Tom Cotton and Mike Lee voted against both plans.Democrat Joe Manchin and Republicans Lamar Alexander, Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, Johnny Isakson, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney voted for both plans.Not voting on either were Republicans Rand Paul and Jim Risch and Democrat Jacky Rosen.Republican Richard Burr voted for Trump\'s plan and did not vote on the Democratic plan.\n\nOn January 25, House Democrats prepared a compromise proposal to reopen the government, which would provide $5 billion for border security but no wall construction.However, the shutdown ended the same day.\n\nOn January 4, after the new Congress was sworn-in and Pelosi regained the speakership, she and Schumer, as well as congressional Republican leadership met with Trump at the White House.Pelosi and Schumer argued that the shutdown needed to end and reported that Trump refused.They said that Trump threatened to ""keep the government closed for a very long period of time.Months or even years.""Later that day, Trump admitted to ""absolutely"" making that threat, adding, ""I\'m very proud of doing what I\'m doing.""Trump then said that he was considering declaring a national emergency to use military funding for the wall.At the meeting, Trump reprimanded his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney for attempting to propose a compromise between Trump\'s $5.7 billion demand for a border wall and the Democrats\' proposal of $1.3 billion for border security.\n\nTrump addressed the nation from the Oval Office at 9 p.m. EST on January 8, in a nationally televised address broadcast on both network and cable television.In his speech, Trump asserted that there was a ""growing humanitarian and security crisis"" on the Mexico–United States border that could only be solved by appropriating $5.7 billion for construction of a steel wall.Trump did not make any new proposals in his speech to break the impasse.Immediately after Trump\'s speech, Schumer and Pelosi delivered a response on behalf of the Democrats, in which they demanded an end to the shutdown and said: ""President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government.""\n\nTrump met with congressional leadership again on January 9, in a meeting lasting 14 minutes.Trump asked Pelosi, ""Will you agree to my wall?"" and when she replied that she would not, Trump said ""bye-bye"" and walked out of the meeting, later declaring it ""a total waste of time"".Schumer accused Trump of throwing a ""temper tantrum"" and slamming his hands on the table.Trump rebuked Schumer\'s comments on Twitter.Vice President Mike Pence and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that Trump remained calm and never raised his voice.On January 10, Pelosi described the preceding day\'s meeting with Trump as ""a setup"" staged by White House aides so that Trump could walk out of the meeting.Pelosi described Trump as ""un-presidential""; accused him of ""exploiting this situation in a way that enhances his power""; and said: ""I don\'t think he really wants a solution.I think he loves the distraction.""\n\nAfter Trump walked out of the January 9 meeting with congressional Democratic leaders, no further negotiations were conducted.Several Republican senators met in the office of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, after the meeting to discuss a compromise to end the shutdown.They discussed agreeing to Trump\'s demand for border wall funding and offering the Democrats help for Dreamers, refugee protections and extensions to H-2B visas.On January 13, Graham proposed that Trump agree to a congressional vote to reopen the government pending the resumption of negotiations.Graham suggested that if Trump and congressional Democrats did not come to an agreement at that time, Trump could declare a national emergency.Trump rejected this proposal the next day.\n\nOn January 19, Trump proposed a temporary extension of the two programs that protect about 700,000 immigrants from deportation—Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)—in exchange for funding for the border wall.The protections would be temporary, with no path to citizenship.Trump had previously revoked TPS for people from a number of Latin American and African countries, and taken steps to rescind DACA.In his remarks at the White House, Trump referred to a ""barrier"" rather than a ""wall"" and indicated that he aimed to erect ""steel barriers in high priority locations"" rather than ""a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea.""\n\nIn addition to funding a border wall, the 1,300-page Republican bill released after Trump made his proposal would make major changes to U.S. immigration policy (which were not included in Trump\'s public announcement).The legislation would severely restrict the ability of children from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to apply for asylum in the United States.Specifically, participation in the Central American Minors Program would be subject to an annual cap and migrant children would be barred from applying for asylum in person at the border, and only migrant children with a ""qualified"" parent in the U.S. would be eligible to apply.The bill would also create a new, more burdensome application process for TPS holders, and would exclude TPS holders from Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen.The American Immigration Lawyers Association government relations director said that the proposal ""would categorically block tens of thousands of children from ever applying for asylum,"" while a Cato Institute immigration analyst wrote that the proposal would not extend DACA, but rather replace it with ""a totally different program that will exclude untold thousands of Dreamers who would have been eligible under DACA.""\n\nDemocrats rejected Trump\'s proposal.In a speech on the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""The president\'s proposal is one-sided, harshly partisan and was made in bad faith.The asylum changes are a poison pill, if there ever was one.""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said extending the DACA proposal temporarily was ""unacceptable"" and a ""non-starter"" because it did not ""represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people\'s lives.""Analysts pointed out that Trump had previously rejected a deal that would have provided funding for the border wall in exchange for further protection for DACA recipients.Conversely, Republicans reacted positively to Trump\'s proposal, and Mitch McConnell said he would bring it to a vote in the Senate.\n\nDuring the shutdown, on January 8 in a press conference, a reporter asked Trump if he was considering declaring a national emergency, to which Trump replied, ""I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want"" and suggested that he could declare an emergency.After this, Trump repeatedly threatened to declare a national emergency to unilaterally order wall construction without congressional authorization.Some of Trump\'s advisors, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, reportedly attempted to dissuade him from doing so.Administration officials considered diverting hurricane-relief and wildfire-relief funds from a $13.9 billion February 2018 emergency supplemental appropriations bill (for disaster relief in Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California, among other places) in order to fund a wall, and directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to look into this possibility.\n\nAn attempt by Trump to invoke emergency powers would almost certainly have prompted a lengthy legal challenge in court.Democrats responded that Trump lacked the authority to declare a national emergency; Representative Adam Schiff called it a ""non-starter"" and said that ""if Harry Truman couldn\'t nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this President doesn\'t have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion dollar wall on the border.""Democratic Representative Nydia Velázquez said the notion of redirecting disaster-relief funds to a border wall was ""beyond appalling"".Presidents have declared emergencies in the past, but none has ""involved funding a policy goal after failing to win congressional approval"".Yale Law School professor Bruce Ackerman wrote that the declaration of a national emergency to build a wall as Trump suggested would be unconstitutional and illegal.Other scholars, such as Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice, believed that Trump could make a colorable argument that diverting military-construction appropriations for border-wall construction was legal, but that doing so would be an abuse of power.Law professor Ilya Somin stated that in the unlikely case that Trump succeeded in using the emergency powers in this way, it would set a dangerous precedent, which Republicans would come to regret next time the president was a Democrat.\n\nOn January 11, Trump—while maintaining he has the authority to do so anytime—said he was not in any rush to declare a national emergency to secure wall funding, saying he would rather see Congress ""do its job"" and that the Democrats ""should come back and vote.""The next day he again threatened to use emergency powers if Democrats did not ""come to their senses.""\n\nOn January 16, Pelosi sent a letter to Trump that indicated the House would be unavailable for the 2019 State of the Union Address that was scheduled for January 29.Pelosi wrote, ""Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government reopens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has reopened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on Jan. 29.""The delivery of the State of the Union address had been delayed or substantially changed on only two occasions since 1913.In a letter sent to the Speaker the next day, Trump said she would not be allowed to take military transport aircraft on scheduled visits to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan.Trump replied, ""We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the shutdown is over.""Pelosi and a congressional delegation had planned on visiting overseas American military personnel.\n\nOn January 23, Trump sent a letter to Pelosi insisting that there were no security concerns and that he would hold the State of the Union Address as scheduled.Trump wrote, ""Therefore, I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and Congress of the United States of America regarding the State of our Union.""In a letter sent in reply, Pelosi stated that the House would not consider a concurrent resolution to authorize the State of the Union Address in the House Chamber until the shutdown ended, writing, ""Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened.""\n\nTrump later stated he would look for an alternative, but then retracted that statement in a pair of tweets announcing that he would wait until the end of the shutdown to give the address in the House Chamber.\n\nOn January 25, Trump announced his support for a three-week funding measure that would reopen the government until February 15.The deal, which also moved forward with long-term Department of Homeland Security funding, did not include funds for a wall.As expected, the agreement provided federal employees with back pay.Both the Senate and House of Representatives passed the funding measure by voice vote, sending the resolution to the President\'s desk.Trump signed the bill the same day, ending the shutdown.\n\nLater in January, Republican senators voted unanimously against a bill to provide back pay to federal contractors.\n\nWithout legislation enacted by February 15, a new partial shutdown would have begun, three weeks after the last ended.A bipartisan group of senators and representatives reached an agreement ""in principle"" on February 11, but Trump did not say whether he would sign it.Included was $1.375 billion for 55 miles of steel border fencing.On February 13, it was reported that, against the wishes of Democratic leaders and many Republicans, Trump was blocking the provision of back pay to federal contractors who were still out of pocket from the shutdown.Both houses passed the bill February 14 with enough votes to override a veto if that happened.\n\nOn February 15, at the White House Rose Garden, Trump announced that he had signed the spending bill to keep the government open.He also declared a national emergency, hoping to get access to $8 billion to use for border security.\n\nAgencies funded by two ""minibus"" appropriations bills passed in September 2018 were not affected by the shutdown.About 380,000 federal employees were furloughed, and an additional 420,000 employees for the affected agencies were expected to work with their pay delayed until the end of the shutdown, totaling 800,000 workers affected out of 2.1 million civilian non-postal federal employees.As only about a quarter of the government was shut down, many people who are not federal employees did not fully realize the effects of the shutdown.\n\nAccording to and , these were the affected agencies:\n\nDepartment of State Department of the Treasury Department of Justice Most of the Department of the Interior Department of Agriculture Department of Commerce Department of Housing and Urban Development Department of Transportation Department of Homeland Security Some Department of Health and Human Services agencies Food and Drug Administration Indian Health Service Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Superfund Research Program Executive Office of the President Most independent agencies Judicial Branch\n\nUnaffected agencies include, according to and :\n\nDepartment of Defense Department of Labor Most of the Department of Health and Human Services Department of Energy Department of Education Department of Veterans Affairs Some Department of the Interior agencies Bureau of Reclamation Central Utah Project District of Columbia (excluding courts) Legislative Branch Social Security Administration Nuclear Regulatory Commission Appalachian Regional Commission Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board Delta Regional Authority Denali Commission Northern Border Regional Commission Southeast Crescent Regional Commission Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board American Battle Monuments Commission U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Cemeterial Expenses of the Army, including Arlington National Cemetery and Soldiers\' and Airmen\'s Home National Cemetery Armed Forces Retirement Home Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System Fund Intelligence Community Management Account Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled Corporation for National and Community Service Corporation for Public Broadcasting Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission Institute of Museum and Library Services Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission Medicare Payment Advisory Commission National Council on Disability National Labor Relations Board National Mediation Board Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission Railroad Retirement Board\n\nJobs affected included staff throughout the United States, not just DC area employees.FBI agents, federal corrections officers, FDA inspectors, NASA employees, TSA staff, Border Patrol staff and CBP officers, census staff, National Park Service staff, members of the Coast Guard, and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers either worked without pay or were furloughed, with increasing numbers of unpaid essential employees failing to show up for work.\n\nOn January 11, 800,000 workers for agencies shutdown or furloughed missed their first paycheck.Federal workers normally receive pay on federal holidays, which include Christmas, New Year\'s Day and potentially Martin Luther King Jr. Day.The shutdown affected the employees\' entitlement to paid holidays due to the shutdown.Unemployment assistance to federal workers furloughed under the government shutdown varied by locality.Only non-reporting workers were eligible for assistance, whereas furloughed workers who still reported to work were not.Workers who received unemployment assistance were required pay it back after the shut down ended and they received backpay.Some furloughed workers sought other employment opportunities while they were idled.However, external employment must meet agency-specific ethics guidelines, and mandatory reviews of external employment were also curtailed as most ethics officials were also furloughed.Federal employees were not able to use vacation or sick leave during the shutdown so scheduled holiday vacation time either became unpaid if the worker was deemed non-essential or was cancelled if the worker was deemed essential.In many cases unused leave over a certain threshold expired at year-end, but employees who had leave scheduled in advance of the shutdown did not have ""use or lose"" leave balances deducted from their accrued leave.Many furloughed employees took to crowd-funding campaigns to raise cash to replace missed paychecks, but these types of solicitations also run afoul of government ethics rules.\n\nAs furloughed federal workers and their families shared stories of their hardships, such as not being able to meet rent or mortgage payments and missed bills, the hashtag ""#ShutdownStories"" went viral on social media.The federal government\'s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) responded by publishing sample letters that employees could send to their creditors.One read, in part, ""I am a Federal employee who has recently been furloughed due to a lack of funding of my agency.Because of this, my income has been severely cut and I am unable to pay the entire cost of my mortgage, along with my other expenses.""Other federal workers reached out to other news outlets to share stories about having to stretch their budgets and the impact of the shutdown on their families.In addition to being unable to meet rent or pay bills, many federal workers around the country were unable to pay for groceries and turned to food banks.One federal prison guard in Louisiana attempted suicide after posting about the financial pressures of the shutdown on Facebook.\n\nThe OPM also suggested that employees who had landlords write: ""I would like to discuss with you the possibility of trading my services to perform maintenance (e.g. painting, carpentry work) in exchange for partial rent payments"" and suggested those who lacked funds to pay bills should hire personal attorneys to assist them.Other organizations also posted advice on how to ""find supplemental income""; the Coast Guard suggested that Coast Guard members ""have a garage sale, offer to watch children, walk pets or house sit"" while furloughed.\n\nOn January 4, The Washington Post reported that because the shutdown was triggered by the failure to enact spending bills that continued a federal government pay freeze, hundreds of senior Trump administration political appointees would receive a roughly $10,000 pay raise the following day.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the pending pay raise was an ""unnecessary byproduct of the shutdown.""\n\nOn January 10, the Senate approved by unanimous consent a bill (S.24, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019) providing that furloughed federal employees would receive back pay for the period of the furlough once appropriations were restored; the bill was approved the next day by the House on a vote of 411–7.Trump signed the bill into law on January 16.\n\nNative American tribes were not paid for treaties negotiated with the United States government.These treaties specified that the federal government must provide funding for health clinics, employee salaries, education, infrastructure and other services, which were not paid during the shutdown.Native lands are ""owned, managed and maintained by the federal government.""Native Americans who receive a per capita check for profits from oil and gas sales from tribal land did not receive check for the month of February.Roads were not plowed on tribal land, and some areas received significant snowfall.This caused people of the Navajo Nation to become trapped inside their homes.Food services, which fed 90,000 Native Americans in 2017, were halted.\n\nNative American communities had a high percentage of individuals who worked for the federal government and lost income during the shutdown.In North and South Dakota, one of the largest employers is the Indian Health Service.The Chippewa tribe reported an economic loss of nearly $100,000 daily in funds that the federal government was supposed to provide as a treaty obligation.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was closed for the shutdown.However, 60 percent of the Indian Health Service (IHS) continued to work without pay.IHS provides care for 2.2 million Native Americans and on January 23, began to deny care that was not considered ""life threatening.""The Bureau of Indian Education was able to stay open because it was funded on a different schedule.Unlike other government shutdowns, there was little outreach from the Trump Administration to Native Americans and the Chippewa tribe in Michigan was given a 24-hour notice that the shutdown would take place and affect the tribe.\n\nThe only military branch that was affected by the shutdown was the Coast Guard because it was part of the Department of Homeland Security, while the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps were all funded through the Department of Defense.Officials were able to fund payment on December 31, 2018, but were not able to do so for the paychecks of January 15 and 30, 2019, along with the pay and benefits for civilian workers and retirees.During the shutdown, the Coast Guard continued to engage in patrolling the American coastline and carrying out overseas missions in locations such as the Persian Gulf along with the Navy and in the Caribbean.Other issues arose in the payment processes for Coast Guard members Tricare Health and Dental Program payments, although the individuals were still covered.\n\nMilitary schools, such as the Coast Guard Academy and the National War College, lost funding due to the shutdown and the schools had to work to find funds to pay professors.\n\nAlthough the Department of Defense was not shut down, the February 4, 2019, date for release of the Pentagon\'s 2020 budget was delayed by at least one month.This had repercussions on the interim period which is usually used by Pentagon planners for adjustments before the 2020 fiscal year which will begin in October 2019.The White House Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the Pentagon request, was shut down when the Pentagon budget arrived in December, and remained inactive, so no work was done on the budget.\n\nOn February 25, 2019, the Pentagon\'s counter-drug (interdiction) funding has up to $85 million not yet obligated, but that money was planned for the known corridors in El Paso, Tucson, Yuma, and El Centro for border fencing, lighting, and road projects, so any funds which might possibly be intended for additional projects elsewhere along the border must be obligated by September 30, 2019, in order not to affect the known corridors.Otherwise appropriations above the $85 million not yet obligated for additional interdiction border projects will have to be approved by additional Congressional appropriations, to reach the $2 billion target.\n\nA January 28, 2019 Congressional Budget Office report estimated that the 35-day partial government shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion, including $3 billion in permanent losses; the CBO estimate excluded indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.The furloughing of 145,000 federal workers and 112,500 federal contractors in the Washington Metropolitan Area cost the regional economy $119 million each day, or 7.3% of the region\'s total output.That reduced GDP by over $2.8 billion in the Washington DC area alone.The shutdown also had a noticeable impact on hunger in the national capital region: food pantries in Washington DC and Northern Virginia reported an increase of around 10% in the number of people coming to pick up groceries, with most of that increase coming from federal workers and contractors.\n\nFitch Ratings warned that an extended shutdown might lead to a downgrade in the U.S.\'s Triple-A credit rating if lawmakers were unable to pass a budget or manage the debt ceiling.That in turn would make borrowing more costly for companies and American households, because it is the benchmark for many other lines of credit.The only time the U.S. credit rating has been downgraded by S&P was during the United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011.\n\nSome economists believed that an extended shutdown would weaken consumer confidence and heighten the risk of pushing the U.S. economy into a recession.Between 800,000 federal government employees and some 4 million federal contractors, the shutdown directly affected nearly 3% of the labor force of the United States; in a typical recession, unemployment increases 2–4%.The reduction in spending by those households combined with the reduction of government services could have macroeconomic results similar to a typical recession.The shutdown had an adverse effect on the budgets of state and local governments, as states covered some federal services (particularly the most vulnerable) during the shutdown.\n\nBy mid-January 2019, the White House Council of Economic Advisors estimated that each week of the shutdown reduced GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, the equivalent of 1.2 points per quarter.CEA chairman Kevin Hassett later acknowledged that GDP growth could decline to zero in the first quarter of 2019 if the shutdown lasted the entire quarter.\n\nAs tax season began in the United States on January 28, some 46,000 Internal Revenue Service workers were called back to work to ensure tax refunds and returns were not affected by the shutdown.The recalled workers allowed the department to continue operations that were automatic and those deemed necessary for the safety of human life or protection of government property, such as processing electronic returns, returns with payments, mailing tax forms, appeals, criminal law enforcement investigations and technical support.\n\nDuring the shutdown, 95% of federal staff for the USDA\'s Food and Nutrition Services were furloughed.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the food-stamp program, could be funded through a $3 billion contingency fund appropriated by Congress in 2018; if the shutdown had continued through March 2019, those funds would have been exhausted, leaving some 38 million Americans without food stamps and endangering food security.Concerns were raised that continuation of the shutdown could delay the issuance of some $140 billion in tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees most of the food supply in the U.S.In early January, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner, reported that the FDA suspended food inspections.He noted that inspection of foreign food was continuing as ""almost normal,"" because they are considered vital.Around January 14, ""high-risk"" food inspections resumed.As of January 22, 2019, 46 percent of the FDA were working, though 20 percent of them were working without pay.During the shutdown, two new recalls for contamination with Listeria or Salmonella took place.Consumer advocacy groups advised of food safety issues during the shutdown.Food safety attorney, Bill Marler, advocated against eating ""fresh, uncooked products on the market place.""Because there was a shortage of FDA inspectors, many imported perishable items, such as produce or flowers, were at risk of spoilage.Meat and some egg products are inspected by the USDA\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service.Federal legislation required those inspectors to remain working without pay.\n\nSchool administrations raised concern about how to feed children who purchase food at the schools for lunch, as funding concerns caused some districts to conserve food and funding.Many limited the amount or variation of foods available for the children to purchase, and alerted parents to the concerns and the limited availability of some of the items.Most schools affected were in high-poverty areas, and depended on federally funded lunch programs, such as the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) a federal grant established by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 and operated through the Department of Agriculture.Some 22 million students in nearly 100,000 schools received school meals through that operation.\n\nAs with the January 2018 shutdown, national parks were expected to be open to the extent practical, though there would be no staff and buildings would be closed.The shutdown affected national parks unevenly, some were accessible with bare-bones staffing levels, some operated with money from states or charitable groups, and others were locked off.Diane Regas, president and chief executive of the Trust for Public Land, called upon Trump to close all national parks to protect the public: by the third week of the shutdown, three people had died in national parks.This number was reported as being within \'usual\' levels.At Yosemite National Park, on January 4, 2019, a death from a fall went unreported for a week.\n\nBy January 1, 2019, the problems of neglected trash pileup, overflowing public toilets, and access to first aid were repeated across the Park system.Health and safety concerns were raised, with concerns by scientists that the expansive amount of garbage and human waste could impact water and soil quality, or cause damage to animals in the parks.Other issues that arose due to the shutdown included illegal campsites, protected agriculture being damaged, damaging of government property and trespassing on foot and by vehicle.\n\nNew York kept the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open, as it did during the January 2018 shutdown.Arizona and Utah were able to keep Grand Canyon National Park, Zion National Park, Arches National Park, and Bryce Canyon National Park open and provided services including public restrooms, shuttles and trash collection.Utah\'s funding included visitor centers.The sites closed outright in the southwest alone included Bandelier National Monument and Valles Caldera National Preserve in northern New Mexico, White Sands National Monument in southern New Mexico, Petrified Forest National Park in northern Arizona and Casa Grande Ruins National Monument in south-central Arizona.Access to major parts of Sequoia and Kings Canyon parks were closed, and at Joshua Tree National Park, the administration policy of leaving parks open to visitors despite the staff furloughs resulted in park damage, including the toppling of protected trees.In Texas, Big Bend National Park had no visitor services, such as restrooms.Some trailheads were closed.Regulations continued to be enforced, as the park remained open.Visitors were reminded to remove their own trash and toilet paper.The Alamo remained open but no NPS services were available at the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park.Channel Islands National Park remained open to public access, although services normally provided by the national park service were instead provided by Island Packers Cruises, the company normally in charge of ferries to the islands.\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration closed immediately on December 22, 2018.The Library of Congress, the U.S. Botanic Garden, the Capitol Visitor Center, and the U.S. Capitol Building remained open as they were funded by the 2019 Legislative Branch appropriations bill.The Smithsonian Institution operated on ""prior-year funds"" through January 1, 2019.On January 2, 2019, the Smithsonian Institution initiated an orderly shutdown of all its facilities, including 19 museums in Washington, D.C., and New York City, the National Zoo, and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.The following day, the National Gallery of Art was closed.The National Zoo also closed on January 3, 2019.Tourism attendance on the National Mall was affected.On January 5, 2019, acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt directed the diversion of fee revenue defined by the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to be used to fund minimal maintenance activities so as to preserve access to highly visited parks.\n\nAccording to a January 12, 2019, article in The Economist, on January 11, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was unable to pay its workers who had not been paid since December 22; 55% more of them called in sick than in January 2018.\n\nAs the air traffic controllers were deemed essential employees, they were required to work without pay.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents air traffic controllers, filed a lawsuit against the federal government for the shutdown on January 11, 2019, claiming that requiring 16,000 air traffic controllers to work without being paid violated their constitutional rights and federal minimum wage law.That was the third lawsuit filed against the federal government since the beginning of the shutdown.\n\nAirline and aircraft safety inspectors, on the other hand, were deemed nonessential and furloughed.A news report on January 12, 2019, stated that the Federal Aviation Administration had returned 500 furloughed safety inspectors back to work and would return more to work in the following weeks.As the airline and aircraft safety inspectors were furloughed, the certification process of the Airbus A220 in the US was stalled.Delta Air Lines was forced to delay the launch of the new aircraft, and to use other models of aircraft to serve those routes that was supposed to be served with A220.Many TSA employees also called out sick, most of them because they were trying to find other jobs that would provide immediate paychecks.\n\nThe shutdown initially prevented the National Transportation Safety Board from assisting the Mexican government\'s investigation of the 2018 Puebla helicopter crash that killed a state governor and senator; an exception allowed the NTSB to assist with the Mexican government in the investigation along with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.The NTSB also had to delay several investigations until the government reopened and only continued investigations into accidents that were considered the most serious.Issues in receiving certification and oversight from the FAA led to a month-long delay in the commencement of passenger service at Paine Field in Everett, Washington.\n\nAs the shutdown continued into its fourth week, the unions representing airline pilots, flight attendants and air traffic controllers issued a statement asserting, ""we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play"" because of the shutdown.\n\nSome airports such as the Philadelphia International Airport, launched food and item donations for federal employees who were affected by the shutdown.Other airports such as the Miami International Airport, and the George Bush International Airport, closed down terminals in order to spread out the TSA workers that were available.\n\nOn January 25, flights destined for LaGuardia Airport in New York were halted to a groundstop by FAA officials due to staffing shortages directly as a result of the shutdown.As a result, several flights to and from neighboring airports in the Northeast, specifically Philadelphia and Newark, suffered significant delays of their own.Soon after that, appropriations passed and the government reopened.\n\nThe shutdown delayed software updates to the Boeing 737 MAX airplane which may have caused the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.\n\nDuring the shutdown, court-appointed private lawyers who represent indigent defendants worked without pay.The Federal Judiciary initially had a goal of sustaining paid operations through January 18, 2019.It said it would run out of money to sustain court operations no earlier than January 25, but perhaps as late as February 1.Failing funding, the Judiciary would operate under the terms of the Antideficiency Act.This Act does not allow federal agencies to expend federal funds before an appropriation, nor to accept any voluntary services.The judiciary had 33,000 employees nationwide.Under the Constitution, Supreme Court Justices, appeals court judges and district judges would continue to be paid.\n\nThe shutdown caused many delays and disruptions in cases.Budgets were watched carefully to be able to pay public defenders, DNA testing, informants, and travel costs to interview victims and witnesses.Staffing issues also brought about concerns and constraints with prisons lacking the staff to safely hold attorney-client visits, and caused a delay in bail hearings.\n\nAgents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed in a report released on January 22, 2019, by the FBI Agents Association, that several different investigations were compromised by the shutdown.The report was called ""Voices from the Field"" and was 72 pages long.FBI agents were unable to pay Confidential Human Sources which risks losing that informant permanently.Some FBI divisions no longer have Spanish-speaking staff on hand and could not work with informants who only speak Spanish.Some agents reported that they did not have the funds to assist in joint operations with local law enforcement.\n\nFederal law enforcement agencies working on Native American land worked without pay through the shutdown.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was forced to cancel a trip to the United States/Mexico border in early January due to the shutdown.DHS was also unable to inspect Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities during the shutdown to ensure that immigrants were being held in facilities appropriately.During the shutdown, the federal government\'s e-Verify system—a system for employers to check the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States—was halted.\n\nDuring the shutdown, a wave of Domain Name System (DNS) attacks on government sites was detected by Homeland Security.The attacks were serious because these Internet sites could be hijacked.\n\nOfficial websites for agencies were rendered insecure or inaccessible through the shutdown, as the expired digital certificates were not renewed.On January 23, DHS asked all government agencies to secure their DNS records; however, many agencies were not able to respond quickly to this request.\n\nExecutive and legislative affairs of the local government of the District of Columbia continued operating through the shutdown, due to a provision previously enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017.The District\'s local court system, including the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, are part of the federal judiciary.Thus, they were partially shut down, preventing District residents from accessing services such as marriage licensing.The District of Columbia government said it would take over trash collection and snow plowing operations for National Park Service facilities in Washington.\n\nThe shutdown also interfered with the response to the 2018 Sunda Strait tsunami, as the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta\'s Twitter account was unable to tweet updates, and the United States Geological Survey was unable to provide data on the tsunami.The American weather model, the GFS, suffered a significant drop in forecast quality when a data format change during the shutdown prevented certain weather data from being recognized by the GFS, and the shutdown prevented the bug from being corrected.\n\nBy mid-day Thursday, January 3, 2019, the FCC had suspended operations.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai canceled his trip to the Consumer Electronics Show.The FTC also suspended certain online operations.The EPA and Department of Energy\'s Energy Star website was not available for the duration of the shutdown.\n\nMakers of alcoholic beverages were unable to receive approval from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau for new labels and recipes during the shutdown.\n\nBased on the recalculation of their operating reserves, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) would have had to cease patent operations in the second week of February.A cadre of personnel was allocated to continue receiving patent applications, receive payments, and maintain the IT infrastructure.Even though the USPTO is self-funded, a Congressional appropriation is required to permit the USPTO to spend money.The pipeline of patent applications at the time took 15.8 months for a response from an examiner.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution shortened to two days and downscaled its scheduled ten-day 2019 Folklife Festival on the National Mall because of the shutdown\'s effects.Sabrina Motley, the director of the festival, said that initially, crucial funding for the June—July event arrived later than expected, slowing preparations.Motley stated: ""The government opened back up, but it took a while for systems to come back online. ...We looked at our production schedule, and it became clear we would need more time than we had.""\n\nThe White House residence staff who stage public receptions were among those furloughed, with a minimal staff continuing to work unpaid for the first family.In the midst of the shutdown Trump invited the Clemson Tigers football team to a White House dinner reception on January 14 in recognition of their College Football Playoff National Championship win.On the morning of the reception Trump announced that he intended to serve fast food hamburgers and pizza to the team, a remark that some commentators interpreted as a joke.That evening Trump welcomed the team in the State Dining Room with a buffet of fast food and pizza from McDonald\'s, Wendy\'s and other restaurant chains, which he stated that he had paid for personally.Trump served fast food to other visiting athletes later that year, after the shutdown had ended.\n\nOn January 10, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with several other unions, announced plans to protest the government shutdown at 1:00pm EST in Washington, DC.Leaders of the National Federation of Federal Employees stated they had hoped that bringing federal workers to the President\'s doorstep would show him that it was the individual workers that the shutdown was hurting the most.President Trump had left to visit the US–Mexican border in Texas earlier in the day.\n\nSimilar protests took place in Philadelphia and St. Louis, among other cities.On January 15, representatives for Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, and Vietnam Veterans of America along with others called for an end to shutdown, but avoided placing any blame on political parties.\n\nShortly after the protests, the American Federation of Government Employees sued the Trump administration to challenge the arrangements for work without pay during the shutdown.A similar suit was raised and won during the 2013 Federal Government shutdown.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association also sued the Trump administration, as the shutdown allegedly violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by failing to pay the workers at least a minimum wage during the shutdown.\n\nAs the salaries for members of Congress are written into permanent law and not funded through annual appropriations, the government shutdown did not affect their salaries.Senators and Representatives were still paid their biweekly salaries of $6,700 towards at least $174,000 a year.\n\nSeveral Democratic and Republican Senators and Representatives said they would donate or refuse their salary during the shutdown.Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw stated that he would refuse his salary, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto indicated she would donate hers to a Nevada charity, Senator Mazie Hirono said she would donate her salary to Hawaii food banks, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would give hers to refugee non-profit HIAS, New York Congressman Max Rose stated that he would give his salary to charity and outgoing Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota pledged hers to charity, along with her Republican colleague John Hoeven.Republican senator Kevin Cramer, who defeated Heidi Heitkamp in the 2018 midterm elections, refused to donate his salary, calling the move ""gimmicky"".Representative Brian Fitzpatrick urged all members of Congress to decline their paychecks.He said, ""If you\'re in Congress, don\'t just delay your pay -- forfeit it, write a check back to the US Treasury.Then you\'ll feel the pain of federal workers.""\n\nBy January 17, 2019, 102 members of Congress—20 Senators and 82 Representatives— chose to decline their paychecks or were donating their paychecks to charity.\n\nDuring the shutdown, many federal workers used food banks and food pantries in order to feed themselves and their families.Many food pantries waived certain restrictions in order to help government workers have access to food.During the shutdown, the Salvation Army Emergency Disasters Services program provided meals for federal workers.Chef Jose Andres created the #ChefsForFeds program to feed federal workers in Washington, D.C. and by January 21, made announcements to expand the program nationwide.\n\nSome states such as California, offered furloughed employees unemployment benefits, although the Trump administration allegedly told states that they could not do so with federal funds.Organizations such as state Attorney Generals offices, and credit card companies posted statements to their websites to offer a means to help to consolidate debt, meet mortgages or other payments such as child support or tuition.An employment law firm offered pro bono legal advice to furloughed federal employees.School districts opened up free or reduced lunch options for children of federal employees, and looked into other options to aid parents amid concerns that financial stress at home would adversely affect families and children.Every mainline denomination in America has contributed to efforts to provide relief.One Baptist church emptied its entire disaster fund to aid federal employees.\n\nOn January 24, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross downplayed the financial difficulties faced by the 800,000 federal workers affected by the shutdown, stating that they should borrow money to ""tide them over"" until the shutdown ends.Critics and Democrats criticized the statement as inappropriate, noting that Ross\' own net worth is estimated at almost $700 million, accusing him of being out of touch with the workers.Ross also said that he ""did not understand"" why people who were not getting paid due to the shutdown were visiting food banks.When asked about Ross\' statement, Trump suggested that grocery stores will ""work along"" with the government by voluntarily extending credit to those who are out of funds to buy food.National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow characterized the shutdown as a ""glitch"" and suggested that federal workers who were required to work without pay were ""volunteering"" to work for their love of the country and ""presumably their allegiance to President Trump.""\n\nIn a video message to staff, FBI director Christopher Wray stated, ""Making some people stay home when they don\'t want to, and making others show up without pay, it\'s mind-boggling, it\'s shortsighted and it\'s unfair.It takes a lot to get me angry, but I\'m about as angry as I\'ve been in a long, long time.""\n\nLara Trump, a daughter-in-law of the President, drew outrage after an interview in which she stated that while ""It\'s not fair to you..."" the shutdown was ""...a little bit of pain, but it\'s going to be for the future of our country, and their children and their grandchildren and generations after them will thank them for their sacrifice right now.""Her comments drew criticism by politicians, celebrities, and the general public who felt the advisor and spokeswoman for the Trump 2020 campaign was out of touch, however Lara Trump later claimed the comments were taken out of context.\n\nIn January 2019, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that 56% of the responding public opposed a wall while 39% favored it, and 45% viewed the situation at the border as a crisis.The numbers were similar to the poll in December 2018 yet a later poll by ABC News showed that as the partial shutdown entered its fourth week support for building a wall was increasing.A poll done through YouGov between December 23–25, 2018, reported that 51% of respondents thought Trump deserved ""a lot"" of the blame, 44% thought congressional Democrats and 39% thought congressional Republicans.Similar results were reported by a December 21–25 survey done by Reuters and Ipsos in which 47% of respondents said that the shutdown was the President\'s fault and 33% blamed Congressional Democrats.\n\nOver the course of the shutdown, Trump\'s approval rating marginally declined while his disapproval rating marginally increased.His net approval rating was by the middle of January 2019 at its lowest point since February 2018.On December 27, 2018, it was reported that Trump\'s approval rating of registered voters was at 39%, with 56% disapproval.Broken down the rating was split across party lines, with Republicans reporting an 80% approval rate while Democrats and independents reported a 90% and 57% disapproval rating, respectively.The poll was conducted through Morning Consult between December 21–23.The poll also reported that 43% of respondents blamed Trump for the shutdown, with 31% blaming congressional Democrats and 7% congressional Republicans.Another poll through The New York Times Upshot/Siena College reported that 89% of voters\' views on Trump and the wall were aligned, suggesting that support for the wall was a function of support for Trump.\n\nThe Washington Post–ABC News poll published on January 13, 2019, found that a larger number of Americans blamed Trump and congressional Republicans than congressional Democrats for the shutdown.A PBS NewsHour–Marist poll found that on January 15, 2019, a majority of Americans thought that President Trump was to blame for the shutdown.A January 2019 poll conducted by telephone for CBS News found that 70% of Americans polled did not want a

49,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018–2019 United States federal government shutdown', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The United States federal government shutdown from midnight EST on December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019 (35 days) was the longest government shutdown in history and the second and final federal government shutdown involving furloughs during the presidency of Donald Trump.It occurred when the 115th Congress and Trump could not agree on an appropriations bill to fund the operations of the federal government for the 2019 fiscal year, or a temporary continuing resolution that would extend the deadline for passing a bill.The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal departments or agencies from conducting non-essential operations without appropriations legislation in place.As a result, nine executive departments with around 800,000 employees had to shut down partially or in full, affecting about one-fourth of government activities and causing employees to be furloughed or required to work without being paid.The Congressional Budget Office estimated the shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion USD, excluding indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.\n\nThe shutdown stemmed from an impasse over Trump\'s demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall.In December 2018, the Senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the bill appeared likely to be approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Trump.After Trump faced heavy criticism from some right-wing media outlets and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to ""build the wall"", he announced that he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund its construction.As a result, the House passed a stopgap bill with funding for the wall, but it was blocked in the Senate by the threat of a Democratic filibuster.\n\nIn January 2019, representatives elected in the November 2018 election took office, giving the Democrats a majority in the House.The House immediately voted to approve the appropriations bill that had previously passed the Senate unanimously (which included no funding for the wall).For several weeks, Trump continued to maintain that he would veto any bill that did not fund an entire border wall, and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the Senate from considering any appropriations legislation that Trump would not support, including the bill that had previously passed.Democrats and some Republicans opposed the shutdown and passed multiple bills to reopen the government, arguing that the government shutdown amounted to ""hostage-taking"" civil servants and that negotiations could only begin once the government was reopened.\n\nOn January 25, 2019, Trump agreed to endorse a stopgap bill to reopen the government for three weeks up until February 15 to allow for negotiations to take place to approve an appropriations bill that both parties could agree on.However, Trump reiterated his demand for the border wall funding and said that he would shut down the government again or declare a national emergency and use military funding to build the wall if Congress did not appropriate the funds by February 15.\n\nTrump\'s approval rating dropped during the shutdown.A majority of Americans opposed exploitation of the shutdown as a negotiating strategy and held Trump responsible for the shutdown: A CBS News poll found that 71% of Americans considered the border wall ""not worth the shutdown"" and a Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 53% of Americans blamed Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, compared to 34% who blamed Democrats and 10% who blamed both parties.\n\nOn February 15, 2019, Trump declared a national emergency to fund the wall and bypass Congress, after being unsatisfied with a bipartisan border bill that had passed the House and the Senate a day before.\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign, then-candidate Trump promised to build a wall along the Mexico–United States border for which Mexico would pay.The president of Mexico rejected the idea of providing any funding for a U.S. border wall.In 2018, Trump requested $ in federal funding for some of barrier on the border, mostly to replace of aging fence built under the Secure Fence Act of 2006.On December 25, 2018, Trump reversed course, suggesting that he might accept of either mostly refurbished barrier (rather than new barriers in locations that did not previously have them) by November 2020.Trump\'s proposals and public statements on the wall have shifted widely over time, with varied proposals as to the design, material, length, height, and width of a wall.\n\nIn September 2018, Congress passed two ""minibus"" appropriations bills for the 2019 United States federal budget, which began on October 1, 2018.These bills combined five of the 12 regular appropriations bills covering 77% of federal discretionary funding, and included a continuing resolution until December 7 for the remaining agencies.On December 6, Congress passed a second continuing resolution to December 21, to give more time for negotiations on Trump\'s proposed border wall, which had been delayed due to the funeral of George H. W. Bush.\n\nA Senate Homeland Security appropriations bill, negotiated by both parties and reported by the committee to the Senate, provided for $ for border security, including funds for ""approximately 65 miles of pedestrian fencing along the southwest border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector"".The bill did not receive a vote on the Senate floor, although House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer indicated that such a proposal could be acceptable to House Democrats.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said the Democratic Party would not support $ for the border wall.At a press conference before the government shutdown, he noted ""the $1.6 billion for border security negotiated by Democrats and Republicans is our position.We believe that is the right way to go.""\n\nOn December 11, President Trump held a televised meeting with Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in the Oval Office and asked them to support an appropriation of $5.7 billion for funding of a border wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico.They refused, resulting in an argument between Trump and both Congressional leaders.During the contentious discussion, Trump remarked, ""I am proud to shut down the government for border security ...I will be the one to shut [the government] down.I\'m not going to blame you for it ...I will take the mantle.I will be the one to shut it down.""Schumer replied, ""We shouldn\'t shut down the government over a dispute.""Ten days later, Trump blamed Democrats for the impending shutdown.\n\nThree days later, Politico reported that Trump was willing to sign a bill with no funding for a border wall that delayed a government shutdown into 2019 and the new Congress.On December 18, following a meeting with Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the government would not shut down on December 22 and that Trump was ""flexible"" over funding for a border wall.Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby commented that the most likely resolution was a bill that funded the government until early February.Schumer added that his caucus would ""very seriously"" consider such a bill and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said ""I don\'t know anybody on the Hill that wants a shutdown, and I think all the president\'s advisers are telling him this would not be good.""\n\nOn December 19, the Senate passed a second continuing resolution () that would fund the government until February 8, 2019.Pelosi announced that House Democrats would support the measure, meaning it would overcome opposition from conservative Republicans and pass the House.On December 20, following increased criticism from conservative media, pundits, and political figures, Trump reversed his position and declared that he would not sign any funding bill that did not include border wall funding.The same day, the House passed a continuing resolution that included $5 billion for the wall and $8 billion in disaster aid.This bill failed in the Senate.Trump\'s changing position caused consternation among Senate Republicans.\n\nThe shutdown started December 22 and Trump announced that he would cancel his planned trip to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas and stay in Washington, D.C.The meaning of the term ""wall"" was expected to be an aspect of the negotiations.\n\nCongress adjourned on December 22 for the Christmas and holiday season, with many predicting that the shutdown would not be resolved until the start of the 116th Congress.The Senate reconvened on December 27 for four minutes, with Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) presiding over the session.The House briefly reconvened as well, with Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) saying that members should not expect any further votes for the rest of 2018.Representative Jim McGovern (D-MA) went to the House floor to try to force consideration of a short-term funding bill to end the shutdown that the Senate had already passed, but the Republican Speaker-pro-tem refused to let him speak.\n\nCongress then adjourned again until December 31, 2018, for a pro forma session.On January 2, 2019, the last full day of the 115th United States Congress, there was a pro forma session scheduled to last several minutes.\n\nThe new Congress was sworn in on January 3, 2019, and one of the first orders of business in the House after electing the Speaker and swearing in the new members was a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security until February 8 (), which passed by a vote of 239–192; and a package combining five appropriation bills funding the rest of the government for the remainder of the fiscal year (), passed by a vote of 241–190.The bills contained $1.3 billion of funding for border security, but no additional funding for a border wall.\n\nBeginning on January 9, the Democratic-controlled House voted on four appropriations bills individually:\n\nFinancial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Treasury (including the Internal Revenue Service), federal judiciary, District of Columbia, and a number of independent agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, General Services Administration, and Securities and Exchange Commission.The House passed the legislation on January 9, on a 240–188 vote, with every Democrat and eight Republicans voting yes, and all other Republicans voting no. Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Department of Agriculture (including food stamps), the Food and Drug Administration, and related entities.On January 10, the House passed this bill 243–183.Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore Transportation and Housing and Urban Development (including some federal mortgage programs).On January 10, the House passed this bill 244–180.Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Interior Department, Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies, including the Smithsonian Institution.On January 11, ten House Republicans voted with Democrats in a 240–179 vote to end the shutdown of Interior-Environment programs.It was the most recent of a ""series of standalone appropriations measures"" the House sent to the Senate.\n\nThis strategy has been compared to one used by Republicans during the 2013 shutdown in the form of a series of fourteen mini-continuing resolutions.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed that the Senate would not consider the House bills to reopen the government, indicating that Senate Republicans would not support any bill unless it had Trump\'s support.In January 2019, McConnell and Senate Republicans came under increased pressure to break the impasse and reopen the government.Three Republican Senators—Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Cory Gardner of Colorado—called for an end to the shutdown.Senators Collins and Gardner said they supported the House\'s budget bills to end the shutdown.West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito said that she could support ending the shutdown provided border wall talks continued.Pat Roberts of Kansas said that shutdowns ""never work"" and only turned affected federal workers into ""pawns"" and that, although the time had not yet come for Senate Republicans to override any possible Trump veto and end the shutdown, ""we\'re getting pretty close.""Johnny Isakson of Georgia echoed that sentiment, saying that support for McConnell\'s refusal to support bills that do not include funding for a wall would not last indefinitely: ""There\'s a time when that may run out.""\n\nOn January 16, McConnell again blocked the House appropriation bills to reopen the government from being considered on the Senate floor.The following day, McConnell blocked consideration of bills to reopen most of the closed government agencies for a third time.On January 23, McConnell blocked a bill to reopen most of the government for the fourth time.\n\nOn January 22, McConnell stated that the Senate would be voting on two different bills to end the shutdown on January 24.The first vote is on a bill to reopen the government which includes Trump\'s proposal to provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and temporary protections to some immigration classes.The other bill is a three-week continuing resolution to fund 25% of the government through February 8.\n\nOn January 22, Senator Mark Warner introduced a bill to keep the federal government running in the event of future shutdown events.The bill is called the ""Stop Shutdowns Transferring Unnecessary Pain and Inflicting Damage in the Coming Years Act"" or the ""Stop STUPIDITY Act"".\n\nOn January 24, the Senate held two votes on competing Democratic and Republican proposals to end the shutdown.The Democratic proposal was largely similar to the measure that had previously passed the Senate unanimously in the 115th Congress, and then been passed by the Democratic-controlled House in the 116th Congress.It provided funding for the government with no money for the border wall.The Republican proposal incorporated Trump\'s proposal, which would fund a border wall; temporarily extend TPS and DACA for three years, but would substantially narrow eligibility for DACA; and make significant legal changes to make it more difficult for persons escaping violence and persecution to be granted asylum in the United States.Neither proposal was able to attain the 60 votes needed for passage.The Trump plan failed in a 50–47 vote.The Democratic plan failed in a 52–44 vote.Most Republicans voted for Trump\'s plan and against the Democratic plan.Most Democrats voted for the Democratic plan and against Trump\'s plan.Republicans Tom Cotton and Mike Lee voted against both plans.Democrat Joe Manchin and Republicans Lamar Alexander, Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, Johnny Isakson, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney voted for both plans.Not voting on either were Republicans Rand Paul and Jim Risch and Democrat Jacky Rosen.Republican Richard Burr voted for Trump\'s plan and did not vote on the Democratic plan.\n\nOn January 25, House Democrats prepared a compromise proposal to reopen the government, which would provide $5 billion for border security but no wall construction.However, the shutdown ended the same day.\n\nOn January 4, after the new Congress was sworn-in and Pelosi regained the speakership, she and Schumer, as well as congressional Republican leadership met with Trump at the White House.Pelosi and Schumer argued that the shutdown needed to end and reported that Trump refused.They said that Trump threatened to ""keep the government closed for a very long period of time.Months or even years.""Later that day, Trump admitted to ""absolutely"" making that threat, adding, ""I\'m very proud of doing what I\'m doing.""Trump then said that he was considering declaring a national emergency to use military funding for the wall.At the meeting, Trump reprimanded his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney for attempting to propose a compromise between Trump\'s $5.7 billion demand for a border wall and the Democrats\' proposal of $1.3 billion for border security.\n\nTrump addressed the nation from the Oval Office at 9 p.m. EST on January 8, in a nationally televised address broadcast on both network and cable television.In his speech, Trump asserted that there was a ""growing humanitarian and security crisis"" on the Mexico–United States border that could only be solved by appropriating $5.7 billion for construction of a steel wall.Trump did not make any new proposals in his speech to break the impasse.Immediately after Trump\'s speech, Schumer and Pelosi delivered a response on behalf of the Democrats, in which they demanded an end to the shutdown and said: ""President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government.""\n\nTrump met with congressional leadership again on January 9, in a meeting lasting 14 minutes.Trump asked Pelosi, ""Will you agree to my wall?"" and when she replied that she would not, Trump said ""bye-bye"" and walked out of the meeting, later declaring it ""a total waste of time"".Schumer accused Trump of throwing a ""temper tantrum"" and slamming his hands on the table.Trump rebuked Schumer\'s comments on Twitter.Vice President Mike Pence and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that Trump remained calm and never raised his voice.On January 10, Pelosi described the preceding day\'s meeting with Trump as ""a setup"" staged by White House aides so that Trump could walk out of the meeting.Pelosi described Trump as ""un-presidential""; accused him of ""exploiting this situation in a way that enhances his power""; and said: ""I don\'t think he really wants a solution.I think he loves the distraction.""\n\nAfter Trump walked out of the January 9 meeting with congressional Democratic leaders, no further negotiations were conducted.Several Republican senators met in the office of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, after the meeting to discuss a compromise to end the shutdown.They discussed agreeing to Trump\'s demand for border wall funding and offering the Democrats help for Dreamers, refugee protections and extensions to H-2B visas.On January 13, Graham proposed that Trump agree to a congressional vote to reopen the government pending the resumption of negotiations.Graham suggested that if Trump and congressional Democrats did not come to an agreement at that time, Trump could declare a national emergency.Trump rejected this proposal the next day.\n\nOn January 19, Trump proposed a temporary extension of the two programs that protect about 700,000 immigrants from deportation—Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)—in exchange for funding for the border wall.The protections would be temporary, with no path to citizenship.Trump had previously revoked TPS for people from a number of Latin American and African countries, and taken steps to rescind DACA.In his remarks at the White House, Trump referred to a ""barrier"" rather than a ""wall"" and indicated that he aimed to erect ""steel barriers in high priority locations"" rather than ""a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea.""\n\nIn addition to funding a border wall, the 1,300-page Republican bill released after Trump made his proposal would make major changes to U.S. immigration policy (which were not included in Trump\'s public announcement).The legislation would severely restrict the ability of children from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to apply for asylum in the United States.Specifically, participation in the Central American Minors Program would be subject to an annual cap and migrant children would be barred from applying for asylum in person at the border, and only migrant children with a ""qualified"" parent in the U.S. would be eligible to apply.The bill would also create a new, more burdensome application process for TPS holders, and would exclude TPS holders from Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen.The American Immigration Lawyers Association government relations director said that the proposal ""would categorically block tens of thousands of children from ever applying for asylum,"" while a Cato Institute immigration analyst wrote that the proposal would not extend DACA, but rather replace it with ""a totally different program that will exclude untold thousands of Dreamers who would have been eligible under DACA.""\n\nDemocrats rejected Trump\'s proposal.In a speech on the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""The president\'s proposal is one-sided, harshly partisan and was made in bad faith.The asylum changes are a poison pill, if there ever was one.""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said extending the DACA proposal temporarily was ""unacceptable"" and a ""non-starter"" because it did not ""represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people\'s lives.""Analysts pointed out that Trump had previously rejected a deal that would have provided funding for the border wall in exchange for further protection for DACA recipients.Conversely, Republicans reacted positively to Trump\'s proposal, and Mitch McConnell said he would bring it to a vote in the Senate.\n\nDuring the shutdown, on January 8 in a press conference, a reporter asked Trump if he was considering declaring a national emergency, to which Trump replied, ""I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want"" and suggested that he could declare an emergency.After this, Trump repeatedly threatened to declare a national emergency to unilaterally order wall construction without congressional authorization.Some of Trump\'s advisors, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, reportedly attempted to dissuade him from doing so.Administration officials considered diverting hurricane-relief and wildfire-relief funds from a $13.9 billion February 2018 emergency supplemental appropriations bill (for disaster relief in Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California, among other places) in order to fund a wall, and directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to look into this possibility.\n\nAn attempt by Trump to invoke emergency powers would almost certainly have prompted a lengthy legal challenge in court.Democrats responded that Trump lacked the authority to declare a national emergency; Representative Adam Schiff called it a ""non-starter"" and said that ""if Harry Truman couldn\'t nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this President doesn\'t have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion dollar wall on the border.""Democratic Representative Nydia Velázquez said the notion of redirecting disaster-relief funds to a border wall was ""beyond appalling"".Presidents have declared emergencies in the past, but none has ""involved funding a policy goal after failing to win congressional approval"".Yale Law School professor Bruce Ackerman wrote that the declaration of a national emergency to build a wall as Trump suggested would be unconstitutional and illegal.Other scholars, such as Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice, believed that Trump could make a colorable argument that diverting military-construction appropriations for border-wall construction was legal, but that doing so would be an abuse of power.Law professor Ilya Somin stated that in the unlikely case that Trump succeeded in using the emergency powers in this way, it would set a dangerous precedent, which Republicans would come to regret next time the president was a Democrat.\n\nOn January 11, Trump—while maintaining he has the authority to do so anytime—said he was not in any rush to declare a national emergency to secure wall funding, saying he would rather see Congress ""do its job"" and that the Democrats ""should come back and vote.""The next day he again threatened to use emergency powers if Democrats did not ""come to their senses.""\n\nOn January 16, Pelosi sent a letter to Trump that indicated the House would be unavailable for the 2019 State of the Union Address that was scheduled for January 29.Pelosi wrote, ""Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government reopens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has reopened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on Jan. 29.""The delivery of the State of the Union address had been delayed or substantially changed on only two occasions since 1913.In a letter sent to the Speaker the next day, Trump said she would not be allowed to take military transport aircraft on scheduled visits to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan.Trump replied, ""We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the shutdown is over.""Pelosi and a congressional delegation had planned on visiting overseas American military personnel.\n\nOn January 23, Trump sent a letter to Pelosi insisting that there were no security concerns and that he would hold the State of the Union Address as scheduled.Trump wrote, ""Therefore, I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and Congress of the United States of America regarding the State of our Union.""In a letter sent in reply, Pelosi stated that the House would not consider a concurrent resolution to authorize the State of the Union Address in the House Chamber until the shutdown ended, writing, ""Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened.""\n\nTrump later stated he would look for an alternative, but then retracted that statement in a pair of tweets announcing that he would wait until the end of the shutdown to give the address in the House Chamber.\n\nOn January 25, Trump announced his support for a three-week funding measure that would reopen the government until February 15.The deal, which also moved forward with long-term Department of Homeland Security funding, did not include funds for a wall.As expected, the agreement provided federal employees with back pay.Both the Senate and House of Representatives passed the funding measure by voice vote, sending the resolution to the President\'s desk.Trump signed the bill the same day, ending the shutdown.\n\nLater in January, Republican senators voted unanimously against a bill to provide back pay to federal contractors.\n\nWithout legislation enacted by February 15, a new partial shutdown would have begun, three weeks after the last ended.A bipartisan group of senators and representatives reached an agreement ""in principle"" on February 11, but Trump did not say whether he would sign it.Included was $1.375 billion for 55 miles of steel border fencing.On February 13, it was reported that, against the wishes of Democratic leaders and many Republicans, Trump was blocking the provision of back pay to federal contractors who were still out of pocket from the shutdown.Both houses passed the bill February 14 with enough votes to override a veto if that happened.\n\nOn February 15, at the White House Rose Garden, Trump announced that he had signed the spending bill to keep the government open.He also declared a national emergency, hoping to get access to $8 billion to use for border security.\n\nAgencies funded by two ""minibus"" appropriations bills passed in September 2018 were not affected by the shutdown.About 380,000 federal employees were furloughed, and an additional 420,000 employees for the affected agencies were expected to work with their pay delayed until the end of the shutdown, totaling 800,000 workers affected out of 2.1 million civilian non-postal federal employees.As only about a quarter of the government was shut down, many people who are not federal employees did not fully realize the effects of the shutdown.\n\nAccording to and , these were the affected agencies:\n\nDepartment of State Department of the Treasury Department of Justice Most of the Department of the Interior Department of Agriculture Department of Commerce Department of Housing and Urban Development Department of Transportation Department of Homeland Security Some Department of Health and Human Services agencies Food and Drug Administration Indian Health Service Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Superfund Research Program Executive Office of the President Most independent agencies Judicial Branch\n\nUnaffected agencies include, according to and :\n\nDepartment of Defense Department of Labor Most of the Department of Health and Human Services Department of Energy Department of Education Department of Veterans Affairs Some Department of the Interior agencies Bureau of Reclamation Central Utah Project District of Columbia (excluding courts) Legislative Branch Social Security Administration Nuclear Regulatory Commission Appalachian Regional Commission Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board Delta Regional Authority Denali Commission Northern Border Regional Commission Southeast Crescent Regional Commission Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board American Battle Monuments Commission U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Cemeterial Expenses of the Army, including Arlington National Cemetery and Soldiers\' and Airmen\'s Home National Cemetery Armed Forces Retirement Home Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System Fund Intelligence Community Management Account Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled Corporation for National and Community Service Corporation for Public Broadcasting Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission Institute of Museum and Library Services Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission Medicare Payment Advisory Commission National Council on Disability National Labor Relations Board National Mediation Board Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission Railroad Retirement Board\n\nJobs affected included staff throughout the United States, not just DC area employees.FBI agents, federal corrections officers, FDA inspectors, NASA employees, TSA staff, Border Patrol staff and CBP officers, census staff, National Park Service staff, members of the Coast Guard, and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers either worked without pay or were furloughed, with increasing numbers of unpaid essential employees failing to show up for work.\n\nOn January 11, 800,000 workers for agencies shutdown or furloughed missed their first paycheck.Federal workers normally receive pay on federal holidays, which include Christmas, New Year\'s Day and potentially Martin Luther King Jr. Day.The shutdown affected the employees\' entitlement to paid holidays due to the shutdown.Unemployment assistance to federal workers furloughed under the government shutdown varied by locality.Only non-reporting workers were eligible for assistance, whereas furloughed workers who still reported to work were not.Workers who received unemployment assistance were required pay it back after the shut down ended and they received backpay.Some furloughed workers sought other employment opportunities while they were idled.However, external employment must meet agency-specific ethics guidelines, and mandatory reviews of external employment were also curtailed as most ethics officials were also furloughed.Federal employees were not able to use vacation or sick leave during the shutdown so scheduled holiday vacation time either became unpaid if the worker was deemed non-essential or was cancelled if the worker was deemed essential.In many cases unused leave over a certain threshold expired at year-end, but employees who had leave scheduled in advance of the shutdown did not have ""use or lose"" leave balances deducted from their accrued leave.Many furloughed employees took to crowd-funding campaigns to raise cash to replace missed paychecks, but these types of solicitations also run afoul of government ethics rules.\n\nAs furloughed federal workers and their families shared stories of their hardships, such as not being able to meet rent or mortgage payments and missed bills, the hashtag ""#ShutdownStories"" went viral on social media.The federal government\'s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) responded by publishing sample letters that employees could send to their creditors.One read, in part, ""I am a Federal employee who has recently been furloughed due to a lack of funding of my agency.Because of this, my income has been severely cut and I am unable to pay the entire cost of my mortgage, along with my other expenses.""Other federal workers reached out to other news outlets to share stories about having to stretch their budgets and the impact of the shutdown on their families.In addition to being unable to meet rent or pay bills, many federal workers around the country were unable to pay for groceries and turned to food banks.One federal prison guard in Louisiana attempted suicide after posting about the financial pressures of the shutdown on Facebook.\n\nThe OPM also suggested that employees who had landlords write: ""I would like to discuss with you the possibility of trading my services to perform maintenance (e.g. painting, carpentry work) in exchange for partial rent payments"" and suggested those who lacked funds to pay bills should hire personal attorneys to assist them.Other organizations also posted advice on how to ""find supplemental income""; the Coast Guard suggested that Coast Guard members ""have a garage sale, offer to watch children, walk pets or house sit"" while furloughed.\n\nOn January 4, The Washington Post reported that because the shutdown was triggered by the failure to enact spending bills that continued a federal government pay freeze, hundreds of senior Trump administration political appointees would receive a roughly $10,000 pay raise the following day.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the pending pay raise was an ""unnecessary byproduct of the shutdown.""\n\nOn January 10, the Senate approved by unanimous consent a bill (S.24, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019) providing that furloughed federal employees would receive back pay for the period of the furlough once appropriations were restored; the bill was approved the next day by the House on a vote of 411–7.Trump signed the bill into law on January 16.\n\nNative American tribes were not paid for treaties negotiated with the United States government.These treaties specified that the federal government must provide funding for health clinics, employee salaries, education, infrastructure and other services, which were not paid during the shutdown.Native lands are ""owned, managed and maintained by the federal government.""Native Americans who receive a per capita check for profits from oil and gas sales from tribal land did not receive check for the month of February.Roads were not plowed on tribal land, and some areas received significant snowfall.This caused people of the Navajo Nation to become trapped inside their homes.Food services, which fed 90,000 Native Americans in 2017, were halted.\n\nNative American communities had a high percentage of individuals who worked for the federal government and lost income during the shutdown.In North and South Dakota, one of the largest employers is the Indian Health Service.The Chippewa tribe reported an economic loss of nearly $100,000 daily in funds that the federal government was supposed to provide as a treaty obligation.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was closed for the shutdown.However, 60 percent of the Indian Health Service (IHS) continued to work without pay.IHS provides care for 2.2 million Native Americans and on January 23, began to deny care that was not considered ""life threatening.""The Bureau of Indian Education was able to stay open because it was funded on a different schedule.Unlike other government shutdowns, there was little outreach from the Trump Administration to Native Americans and the Chippewa tribe in Michigan was given a 24-hour notice that the shutdown would take place and affect the tribe.\n\nThe only military branch that was affected by the shutdown was the Coast Guard because it was part of the Department of Homeland Security, while the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps were all funded through the Department of Defense.Officials were able to fund payment on December 31, 2018, but were not able to do so for the paychecks of January 15 and 30, 2019, along with the pay and benefits for civilian workers and retirees.During the shutdown, the Coast Guard continued to engage in patrolling the American coastline and carrying out overseas missions in locations such as the Persian Gulf along with the Navy and in the Caribbean.Other issues arose in the payment processes for Coast Guard members Tricare Health and Dental Program payments, although the individuals were still covered.\n\nMilitary schools, such as the Coast Guard Academy and the National War College, lost funding due to the shutdown and the schools had to work to find funds to pay professors.\n\nAlthough the Department of Defense was not shut down, the February 4, 2019, date for release of the Pentagon\'s 2020 budget was delayed by at least one month.This had repercussions on the interim period which is usually used by Pentagon planners for adjustments before the 2020 fiscal year which will begin in October 2019.The White House Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the Pentagon request, was shut down when the Pentagon budget arrived in December, and remained inactive, so no work was done on the budget.\n\nOn February 25, 2019, the Pentagon\'s counter-drug (interdiction) funding has up to $85 million not yet obligated, but that money was planned for the known corridors in El Paso, Tucson, Yuma, and El Centro for border fencing, lighting, and road projects, so any funds which might possibly be intended for additional projects elsewhere along the border must be obligated by September 30, 2019, in order not to affect the known corridors.Otherwise appropriations above the $85 million not yet obligated for additional interdiction border projects will have to be approved by additional Congressional appropriations, to reach the $2 billion target.\n\nA January 28, 2019 Congressional Budget Office report estimated that the 35-day partial government shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion, including $3 billion in permanent losses; the CBO estimate excluded indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.The furloughing of 145,000 federal workers and 112,500 federal contractors in the Washington Metropolitan Area cost the regional economy $119 million each day, or 7.3% of the region\'s total output.That reduced GDP by over $2.8 billion in the Washington DC area alone.The shutdown also had a noticeable impact on hunger in the national capital region: food pantries in Washington DC and Northern Virginia reported an increase of around 10% in the number of people coming to pick up groceries, with most of that increase coming from federal workers and contractors.\n\nFitch Ratings warned that an extended shutdown might lead to a downgrade in the U.S.\'s Triple-A credit rating if lawmakers were unable to pass a budget or manage the debt ceiling.That in turn would make borrowing more costly for companies and American households, because it is the benchmark for many other lines of credit.The only time the U.S. credit rating has been downgraded by S&P was during the United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011.\n\nSome economists believed that an extended shutdown would weaken consumer confidence and heighten the risk of pushing the U.S. economy into a recession.Between 800,000 federal government employees and some 4 million federal contractors, the shutdown directly affected nearly 3% of the labor force of the United States; in a typical recession, unemployment increases 2–4%.The reduction in spending by those households combined with the reduction of government services could have macroeconomic results similar to a typical recession.The shutdown had an adverse effect on the budgets of state and local governments, as states covered some federal services (particularly the most vulnerable) during the shutdown.\n\nBy mid-January 2019, the White House Council of Economic Advisors estimated that each week of the shutdown reduced GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, the equivalent of 1.2 points per quarter.CEA chairman Kevin Hassett later acknowledged that GDP growth could decline to zero in the first quarter of 2019 if the shutdown lasted the entire quarter.\n\nAs tax season began in the United States on January 28, some 46,000 Internal Revenue Service workers were called back to work to ensure tax refunds and returns were not affected by the shutdown.The recalled workers allowed the department to continue operations that were automatic and those deemed necessary for the safety of human life or protection of government property, such as processing electronic returns, returns with payments, mailing tax forms, appeals, criminal law enforcement investigations and technical support.\n\nDuring the shutdown, 95% of federal staff for the USDA\'s Food and Nutrition Services were furloughed.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the food-stamp program, could be funded through a $3 billion contingency fund appropriated by Congress in 2018; if the shutdown had continued through March 2019, those funds would have been exhausted, leaving some 38 million Americans without food stamps and endangering food security.Concerns were raised that continuation of the shutdown could delay the issuance of some $140 billion in tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees most of the food supply in the U.S.In early January, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner, reported that the FDA suspended food inspections.He noted that inspection of foreign food was continuing as ""almost normal,"" because they are considered vital.Around January 14, ""high-risk"" food inspections resumed.As of January 22, 2019, 46 percent of the FDA were working, though 20 percent of them were working without pay.During the shutdown, two new recalls for contamination with Listeria or Salmonella took place.Consumer advocacy groups advised of food safety issues during the shutdown.Food safety attorney, Bill Marler, advocated against eating ""fresh, uncooked products on the market place.""Because there was a shortage of FDA inspectors, many imported perishable items, such as produce or flowers, were at risk of spoilage.Meat and some egg products are inspected by the USDA\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service.Federal legislation required those inspectors to remain working without pay.\n\nSchool administrations raised concern about how to feed children who purchase food at the schools for lunch, as funding concerns caused some districts to conserve food and funding.Many limited the amount or variation of foods available for the children to purchase, and alerted parents to the concerns and the limited availability of some of the items.Most schools affected were in high-poverty areas, and depended on federally funded lunch programs, such as the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) a federal grant established by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 and operated through the Department of Agriculture.Some 22 million students in nearly 100,000 schools received school meals through that operation.\n\nAs with the January 2018 shutdown, national parks were expected to be open to the extent practical, though there would be no staff and buildings would be closed.The shutdown affected national parks unevenly, some were accessible with bare-bones staffing levels, some operated with money from states or charitable groups, and others were locked off.Diane Regas, president and chief executive of the Trust for Public Land, called upon Trump to close all national parks to protect the public: by the third week of the shutdown, three people had died in national parks.This number was reported as being within \'usual\' levels.At Yosemite National Park, on January 4, 2019, a death from a fall went unreported for a week.\n\nBy January 1, 2019, the problems of neglected trash pileup, overflowing public toilets, and access to first aid were repeated across the Park system.Health and safety concerns were raised, with concerns by scientists that the expansive amount of garbage and human waste could impact water and soil quality, or cause damage to animals in the parks.Other issues that arose due to the shutdown included illegal campsites, protected agriculture being damaged, damaging of government property and trespassing on foot and by vehicle.\n\nNew York kept the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open, as it did during the January 2018 shutdown.Arizona and Utah were able to keep Grand Canyon National Park, Zion National Park, Arches National Park, and Bryce Canyon National Park open and provided services including public restrooms, shuttles and trash collection.Utah\'s funding included visitor centers.The sites closed outright in the southwest alone included Bandelier National Monument and Valles Caldera National Preserve in northern New Mexico, White Sands National Monument in southern New Mexico, Petrified Forest National Park in northern Arizona and Casa Grande Ruins National Monument in south-central Arizona.Access to major parts of Sequoia and Kings Canyon parks were closed, and at Joshua Tree National Park, the administration policy of leaving parks open to visitors despite the staff furloughs resulted in park damage, including the toppling of protected trees.In Texas, Big Bend National Park had no visitor services, such as restrooms.Some trailheads were closed.Regulations continued to be enforced, as the park remained open.Visitors were reminded to remove their own trash and toilet paper.The Alamo remained open but no NPS services were available at the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park.Channel Islands National Park remained open to public access, although services normally provided by the national park service were instead provided by Island Packers Cruises, the company normally in charge of ferries to the islands.\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration closed immediately on December 22, 2018.The Library of Congress, the U.S. Botanic Garden, the Capitol Visitor Center, and the U.S. Capitol Building remained open as they were funded by the 2019 Legislative Branch appropriations bill.The Smithsonian Institution operated on ""prior-year funds"" through January 1, 2019.On January 2, 2019, the Smithsonian Institution initiated an orderly shutdown of all its facilities, including 19 museums in Washington, D.C., and New York City, the National Zoo, and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.The following day, the National Gallery of Art was closed.The National Zoo also closed on January 3, 2019.Tourism attendance on the National Mall was affected.On January 5, 2019, acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt directed the diversion of fee revenue defined by the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to be used to fund minimal maintenance activities so as to preserve access to highly visited parks.\n\nAccording to a January 12, 2019, article in The Economist, on January 11, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was unable to pay its workers who had not been paid since December 22; 55% more of them called in sick than in January 2018.\n\nAs the air traffic controllers were deemed essential employees, they were required to work without pay.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents air traffic controllers, filed a lawsuit against the federal government for the shutdown on January 11, 2019, claiming that requiring 16,000 air traffic controllers to work without being paid violated their constitutional rights and federal minimum wage law.That was the third lawsuit filed against the federal government since the beginning of the shutdown.\n\nAirline and aircraft safety inspectors, on the other hand, were deemed nonessential and furloughed.A news report on January 12, 2019, stated that the Federal Aviation Administration had returned 500 furloughed safety inspectors back to work and would return more to work in the following weeks.As the airline and aircraft safety inspectors were furloughed, the certification process of the Airbus A220 in the US was stalled.Delta Air Lines was forced to delay the launch of the new aircraft, and to use other models of aircraft to serve those routes that was supposed to be served with A220.Many TSA employees also called out sick, most of them because they were trying to find other jobs that would provide immediate paychecks.\n\nThe shutdown initially prevented the National Transportation Safety Board from assisting the Mexican government\'s investigation of the 2018 Puebla helicopter crash that killed a state governor and senator; an exception allowed the NTSB to assist with the Mexican government in the investigation along with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.The NTSB also had to delay several investigations until the government reopened and only continued investigations into accidents that were considered the most serious.Issues in receiving certification and oversight from the FAA led to a month-long delay in the commencement of passenger service at Paine Field in Everett, Washington.\n\nAs the shutdown continued into its fourth week, the unions representing airline pilots, flight attendants and air traffic controllers issued a statement asserting, ""we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play"" because of the shutdown.\n\nSome airports such as the Philadelphia International Airport, launched food and item donations for federal employees who were affected by the shutdown.Other airports such as the Miami International Airport, and the George Bush International Airport, closed down terminals in order to spread out the TSA workers that were available.\n\nOn January 25, flights destined for LaGuardia Airport in New York were halted to a groundstop by FAA officials due to staffing shortages directly as a result of the shutdown.As a result, several flights to and from neighboring airports in the Northeast, specifically Philadelphia and Newark, suffered significant delays of their own.Soon after that, appropriations passed and the government reopened.\n\nThe shutdown delayed software updates to the Boeing 737 MAX airplane which may have caused the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.\n\nDuring the shutdown, court-appointed private lawyers who represent indigent defendants worked without pay.The Federal Judiciary initially had a goal of sustaining paid operations through January 18, 2019.It said it would run out of money to sustain court operations no earlier than January 25, but perhaps as late as February 1.Failing funding, the Judiciary would operate under the terms of the Antideficiency Act.This Act does not allow federal agencies to expend federal funds before an appropriation, nor to accept any voluntary services.The judiciary had 33,000 employees nationwide.Under the Constitution, Supreme Court Justices, appeals court judges and district judges would continue to be paid.\n\nThe shutdown caused many delays and disruptions in cases.Budgets were watched carefully to be able to pay public defenders, DNA testing, informants, and travel costs to interview victims and witnesses.Staffing issues also brought about concerns and constraints with prisons lacking the staff to safely hold attorney-client visits, and caused a delay in bail hearings.\n\nAgents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed in a report released on January 22, 2019, by the FBI Agents Association, that several different investigations were compromised by the shutdown.The report was called ""Voices from the Field"" and was 72 pages long.FBI agents were unable to pay Confidential Human Sources which risks losing that informant permanently.Some FBI divisions no longer have Spanish-speaking staff on hand and could not work with informants who only speak Spanish.Some agents reported that they did not have the funds to assist in joint operations with local law enforcement.\n\nFederal law enforcement agencies working on Native American land worked without pay through the shutdown.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was forced to cancel a trip to the United States/Mexico border in early January due to the shutdown.DHS was also unable to inspect Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities during the shutdown to ensure that immigrants were being held in facilities appropriately.During the shutdown, the federal government\'s e-Verify system—a system for employers to check the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States—was halted.\n\nDuring the shutdown, a wave of Domain Name System (DNS) attacks on government sites was detected by Homeland Security.The attacks were serious because these Internet sites could be hijacked.\n\nOfficial websites for agencies were rendered insecure or inaccessible through the shutdown, as the expired digital certificates were not renewed.On January 23, DHS asked all government agencies to secure their DNS records; however, many agencies were not able to respond quickly to this request.\n\nExecutive and legislative affairs of the local government of the District of Columbia continued operating through the shutdown, due to a provision previously enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017.The District\'s local court system, including the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, are part of the federal judiciary.Thus, they were partially shut down, preventing District residents from accessing services such as marriage licensing.The District of Columbia government said it would take over trash collection and snow plowing operations for National Park Service facilities in Washington.\n\nThe shutdown also interfered with the response to the 2018 Sunda Strait tsunami, as the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta\'s Twitter account was unable to tweet updates, and the United States Geological Survey was unable to provide data on the tsunami.The American weather model, the GFS, suffered a significant drop in forecast quality when a data format change during the shutdown prevented certain weather data from being recognized by the GFS, and the shutdown prevented the bug from being corrected.\n\nBy mid-day Thursday, January 3, 2019, the FCC had suspended operations.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai canceled his trip to the Consumer Electronics Show.The FTC also suspended certain online operations.The EPA and Department of Energy\'s Energy Star website was not available for the duration of the shutdown.\n\nMakers of alcoholic beverages were unable to receive approval from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau for new labels and recipes during the shutdown.\n\nBased on the recalculation of their operating reserves, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) would have had to cease patent operations in the second week of February.A cadre of personnel was allocated to continue receiving patent applications, receive payments, and maintain the IT infrastructure.Even though the USPTO is self-funded, a Congressional appropriation is required to permit the USPTO to spend money.The pipeline of patent applications at the time took 15.8 months for a response from an examiner.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution shortened to two days and downscaled its scheduled ten-day 2019 Folklife Festival on the National Mall because of the shutdown\'s effects.Sabrina Motley, the director of the festival, said that initially, crucial funding for the June—July event arrived later than expected, slowing preparations.Motley stated: ""The government opened back up, but it took a while for systems to come back online. ...We looked at our production schedule, and it became clear we would need more time than we had.""\n\nThe White House residence staff who stage public receptions were among those furloughed, with a minimal staff continuing to work unpaid for the first family.In the midst of the shutdown Trump invited the Clemson Tigers football team to a White House dinner reception on January 14 in recognition of their College Football Playoff National Championship win.On the morning of the reception Trump announced that he intended to serve fast food hamburgers and pizza to the team, a remark that some commentators interpreted as a joke.That evening Trump welcomed the team in the State Dining Room with a buffet of fast food and pizza from McDonald\'s, Wendy\'s and other restaurant chains, which he stated that he had paid for personally.Trump served fast food to other visiting athletes later that year, after the shutdown had ended.\n\nOn January 10, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with several other unions, announced plans to protest the government shutdown at 1:00pm EST in Washington, DC.Leaders of the National Federation of Federal Employees stated they had hoped that bringing federal workers to the President\'s doorstep would show him that it was the individual workers that the shutdown was hurting the most.President Trump had left to visit the US–Mexican border in Texas earlier in the day.\n\nSimilar protests took place in Philadelphia and St. Louis, among other cities.On January 15, representatives for Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, and Vietnam Veterans of America along with others called for an end to shutdown, but avoided placing any blame on political parties.\n\nShortly after the protests, the American Federation of Government Employees sued the Trump administration to challenge the arrangements for work without pay during the shutdown.A similar suit was raised and won during the 2013 Federal Government shutdown.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association also sued the Trump administration, as the shutdown allegedly violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by failing to pay the workers at least a minimum wage during the shutdown.\n\nAs the salaries for members of Congress are written into permanent law and not funded through annual appropriations, the government shutdown did not affect their salaries.Senators and Representatives were still paid their biweekly salaries of $6,700 towards at least $174,000 a year.\n\nSeveral Democratic and Republican Senators and Representatives said they would donate or refuse their salary during the shutdown.Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw stated that he would refuse his salary, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto indicated she would donate hers to a Nevada charity, Senator Mazie Hirono said she would donate her salary to Hawaii food banks, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would give hers to refugee non-profit HIAS, New York Congressman Max Rose stated that he would give his salary to charity and outgoing Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota pledged hers to charity, along with her Republican colleague John Hoeven.Republican senator Kevin Cramer, who defeated Heidi Heitkamp in the 2018 midterm elections, refused to donate his salary, calling the move ""gimmicky"".Representative Brian Fitzpatrick urged all members of Congress to decline their paychecks.He said, ""If you\'re in Congress, don\'t just delay your pay -- forfeit it, write a check back to the US Treasury.Then you\'ll feel the pain of federal workers.""\n\nBy January 17, 2019, 102 members of Congress—20 Senators and 82 Representatives— chose to decline their paychecks or were donating their paychecks to charity.\n\nDuring the shutdown, many federal workers used food banks and food pantries in order to feed themselves and their families.Many food pantries waived certain restrictions in order to help government workers have access to food.During the shutdown, the Salvation Army Emergency Disasters Services program provided meals for federal workers.Chef Jose Andres created the #ChefsForFeds program to feed federal workers in Washington, D.C. and by January 21, made announcements to expand the program nationwide.\n\nSome states such as California, offered furloughed employees unemployment benefits, although the Trump administration allegedly told states that they could not do so with federal funds.Organizations such as state Attorney Generals offices, and credit card companies posted statements to their websites to offer a means to help to consolidate debt, meet mortgages or other payments such as child support or tuition.An employment law firm offered pro bono legal advice to furloughed federal employees.School districts opened up free or reduced lunch options for children of federal employees, and looked into other options to aid parents amid concerns that financial stress at home would adversely affect families and children.Every mainline denomination in America has contributed to efforts to provide relief.One Baptist church emptied its entire disaster fund to aid federal employees.\n\nOn January 24, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross downplayed the financial difficulties faced by the 800,000 federal workers affected by the shutdown, stating that they should borrow money to ""tide them over"" until the shutdown ends.Critics and Democrats criticized the statement as inappropriate, noting that Ross\' own net worth is estimated at almost $700 million, accusing him of being out of touch with the workers.Ross also said that he ""did not understand"" why people who were not getting paid due to the shutdown were visiting food banks.When asked about Ross\' statement, Trump suggested that grocery stores will ""work along"" with the government by voluntarily extending credit to those who are out of funds to buy food.National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow characterized the shutdown as a ""glitch"" and suggested that federal workers who were required to work without pay were ""volunteering"" to work for their love of the country and ""presumably their allegiance to President Trump.""\n\nIn a video message to staff, FBI director Christopher Wray stated, ""Making some people stay home when they don\'t want to, and making others show up without pay, it\'s mind-boggling, it\'s shortsighted and it\'s unfair.It takes a lot to get me angry, but I\'m about as angry as I\'ve been in a long, long time.""\n\nLara Trump, a daughter-in-law of the President, drew outrage after an interview in which she stated that while ""It\'s not fair to you..."" the shutdown was ""...a little bit of pain, but it\'s going to be for the future of our country, and their children and their grandchildren and generations after them will thank them for their sacrifice right now.""Her comments drew criticism by politicians, celebrities, and the general public who felt the advisor and spokeswoman for the Trump 2020 campaign was out of touch, however Lara Trump later claimed the comments were taken out of context.\n\nIn January 2019, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that 56% of the responding public opposed a wall while 39% favored it, and 45% viewed the situation at the border as a crisis.The numbers were similar to the poll in December 2018 yet a later poll by ABC News showed that as the partial shutdown entered its fourth week support for building a wall was increasing.A poll done through YouGov between December 23–25, 2018, reported that 51% of respondents thought Trump deserved ""a lot"" of the blame, 44% thought congressional Democrats and 39% thought congressional Republicans.Similar results were reported by a December 21–25 survey done by Reuters and Ipsos in which 47% of respondents said that the shutdown was the President\'s fault and 33% blamed Congressional Democrats.\n\nOver the course of the shutdown, Trump\'s approval rating marginally declined while his disapproval rating marginally increased.His net approval rating was by the middle of January 2019 at its lowest point since February 2018.On December 27, 2018, it was reported that Trump\'s approval rating of registered voters was at 39%, with 56% disapproval.Broken down the rating was split across party lines, with Republicans reporting an 80% approval rate while Democrats and independents reported a 90% and 57% disapproval rating, respectively.The poll was conducted through Morning Consult between December 21–23.The poll also reported that 43% of respondents blamed Trump for the shutdown, with 31% blaming congressional Democrats and 7% congressional Republicans.Another poll through The New York Times Upshot/Siena College reported that 89% of voters\' views on Trump and the wall were aligned, suggesting that support for the wall was a function of support for Trump.\n\nThe Washington Post–ABC News poll published on January 13, 2019, found that a larger number of Americans blamed Trump and congressional Republicans than congressional Democrats for the shutdown.A PBS NewsHour–Marist poll found that on January 15, 2019, a majority of Americans thought that President Trump was to blame for the shutdown.A January 2019 poll conducted by telephone for CBS News found that 70% of Americans polled did not want a government shutdown over the issue of building a border wall; 66% believed that Trump should agree to a budget without wall funding.\n\nPresidency of Donald Trump Donald Trump January 2018 United

50,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018–2019 United States federal government shutdown', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The United States federal government shutdown from midnight EST on December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019 (35 days) was the longest government shutdown in history and the second and final federal government shutdown involving furloughs during the presidency of Donald Trump.It occurred when the 115th Congress and Trump could not agree on an appropriations bill to fund the operations of the federal government for the 2019 fiscal year, or a temporary continuing resolution that would extend the deadline for passing a bill.The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal departments or agencies from conducting non-essential operations without appropriations legislation in place.As a result, nine executive departments with around 800,000 employees had to shut down partially or in full, affecting about one-fourth of government activities and causing employees to be furloughed or required to work without being paid.The Congressional Budget Office estimated the shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion USD, excluding indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.\n\nThe shutdown stemmed from an impasse over Trump\'s demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall.In December 2018, the Senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the bill appeared likely to be approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Trump.After Trump faced heavy criticism from some right-wing media outlets and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to ""build the wall"", he announced that he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund its construction.As a result, the House passed a stopgap bill with funding for the wall, but it was blocked in the Senate by the threat of a Democratic filibuster.\n\nIn January 2019, representatives elected in the November 2018 election took office, giving the Democrats a majority in the House.The House immediately voted to approve the appropriations bill that had previously passed the Senate unanimously (which included no funding for the wall).For several weeks, Trump continued to maintain that he would veto any bill that did not fund an entire border wall, and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the Senate from considering any appropriations legislation that Trump would not support, including the bill that had previously passed.Democrats and some Republicans opposed the shutdown and passed multiple bills to reopen the government, arguing that the government shutdown amounted to ""hostage-taking"" civil servants and that negotiations could only begin once the government was reopened.\n\nOn January 25, 2019, Trump agreed to endorse a stopgap bill to reopen the government for three weeks up until February 15 to allow for negotiations to take place to approve an appropriations bill that both parties could agree on.However, Trump reiterated his demand for the border wall funding and said that he would shut down the government again or declare a national emergency and use military funding to build the wall if Congress did not appropriate the funds by February 15.\n\nTrump\'s approval rating dropped during the shutdown.A majority of Americans opposed exploitation of the shutdown as a negotiating strategy and held Trump responsible for the shutdown: A CBS News poll found that 71% of Americans considered the border wall ""not worth the shutdown"" and a Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 53% of Americans blamed Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, compared to 34% who blamed Democrats and 10% who blamed both parties.\n\nOn February 15, 2019, Trump declared a national emergency to fund the wall and bypass Congress, after being unsatisfied with a bipartisan border bill that had passed the House and the Senate a day before.\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign, then-candidate Trump promised to build a wall along the Mexico–United States border for which Mexico would pay.The president of Mexico rejected the idea of providing any funding for a U.S. border wall.In 2018, Trump requested $ in federal funding for some of barrier on the border, mostly to replace of aging fence built under the Secure Fence Act of 2006.On December 25, 2018, Trump reversed course, suggesting that he might accept of either mostly refurbished barrier (rather than new barriers in locations that did not previously have them) by November 2020.Trump\'s proposals and public statements on the wall have shifted widely over time, with varied proposals as to the design, material, length, height, and width of a wall.\n\nIn September 2018, Congress passed two ""minibus"" appropriations bills for the 2019 United States federal budget, which began on October 1, 2018.These bills combined five of the 12 regular appropriations bills covering 77% of federal discretionary funding, and included a continuing resolution until December 7 for the remaining agencies.On December 6, Congress passed a second continuing resolution to December 21, to give more time for negotiations on Trump\'s proposed border wall, which had been delayed due to the funeral of George H. W. Bush.\n\nA Senate Homeland Security appropriations bill, negotiated by both parties and reported by the committee to the Senate, provided for $ for border security, including funds for ""approximately 65 miles of pedestrian fencing along the southwest border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector"".The bill did not receive a vote on the Senate floor, although House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer indicated that such a proposal could be acceptable to House Democrats.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said the Democratic Party would not support $ for the border wall.At a press conference before the government shutdown, he noted ""the $1.6 billion for border security negotiated by Democrats and Republicans is our position.We believe that is the right way to go.""\n\nOn December 11, President Trump held a televised meeting with Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in the Oval Office and asked them to support an appropriation of $5.7 billion for funding of a border wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico.They refused, resulting in an argument between Trump and both Congressional leaders.During the contentious discussion, Trump remarked, ""I am proud to shut down the government for border security ...I will be the one to shut [the government] down.I\'m not going to blame you for it ...I will take the mantle.I will be the one to shut it down.""Schumer replied, ""We shouldn\'t shut down the government over a dispute.""Ten days later, Trump blamed Democrats for the impending shutdown.\n\nThree days later, Politico reported that Trump was willing to sign a bill with no funding for a border wall that delayed a government shutdown into 2019 and the new Congress.On December 18, following a meeting with Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the government would not shut down on December 22 and that Trump was ""flexible"" over funding for a border wall.Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby commented that the most likely resolution was a bill that funded the government until early February.Schumer added that his caucus would ""very seriously"" consider such a bill and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said ""I don\'t know anybody on the Hill that wants a shutdown, and I think all the president\'s advisers are telling him this would not be good.""\n\nOn December 19, the Senate passed a second continuing resolution () that would fund the government until February 8, 2019.Pelosi announced that House Democrats would support the measure, meaning it would overcome opposition from conservative Republicans and pass the House.On December 20, following increased criticism from conservative media, pundits, and political figures, Trump reversed his position and declared that he would not sign any funding bill that did not include border wall funding.The same day, the House passed a continuing resolution that included $5 billion for the wall and $8 billion in disaster aid.This bill failed in the Senate.Trump\'s changing position caused consternation among Senate Republicans.\n\nThe shutdown started December 22 and Trump announced that he would cancel his planned trip to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas and stay in Washington, D.C.The meaning of the term ""wall"" was expected to be an aspect of the negotiations.\n\nCongress adjourned on December 22 for the Christmas and holiday season, with many predicting that the shutdown would not be resolved until the start of the 116th Congress.The Senate reconvened on December 27 for four minutes, with Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) presiding over the session.The House briefly reconvened as well, with Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) saying that members should not expect any further votes for the rest of 2018.Representative Jim McGovern (D-MA) went to the House floor to try to force consideration of a short-term funding bill to end the shutdown that the Senate had already passed, but the Republican Speaker-pro-tem refused to let him speak.\n\nCongress then adjourned again until December 31, 2018, for a pro forma session.On January 2, 2019, the last full day of the 115th United States Congress, there was a pro forma session scheduled to last several minutes.\n\nThe new Congress was sworn in on January 3, 2019, and one of the first orders of business in the House after electing the Speaker and swearing in the new members was a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security until February 8 (), which passed by a vote of 239–192; and a package combining five appropriation bills funding the rest of the government for the remainder of the fiscal year (), passed by a vote of 241–190.The bills contained $1.3 billion of funding for border security, but no additional funding for a border wall.\n\nBeginning on January 9, the Democratic-controlled House voted on four appropriations bills individually:\n\nFinancial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Treasury (including the Internal Revenue Service), federal judiciary, District of Columbia, and a number of independent agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, General Services Administration, and Securities and Exchange Commission.The House passed the legislation on January 9, on a 240–188 vote, with every Democrat and eight Republicans voting yes, and all other Republicans voting no. Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Department of Agriculture (including food stamps), the Food and Drug Administration, and related entities.On January 10, the House passed this bill 243–183.Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore Transportation and Housing and Urban Development (including some federal mortgage programs).On January 10, the House passed this bill 244–180.Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Interior Department, Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies, including the Smithsonian Institution.On January 11, ten House Republicans voted with Democrats in a 240–179 vote to end the shutdown of Interior-Environment programs.It was the most recent of a ""series of standalone appropriations measures"" the House sent to the Senate.\n\nThis strategy has been compared to one used by Republicans during the 2013 shutdown in the form of a series of fourteen mini-continuing resolutions.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed that the Senate would not consider the House bills to reopen the government, indicating that Senate Republicans would not support any bill unless it had Trump\'s support.In January 2019, McConnell and Senate Republicans came under increased pressure to break the impasse and reopen the government.Three Republican Senators—Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Cory Gardner of Colorado—called for an end to the shutdown.Senators Collins and Gardner said they supported the House\'s budget bills to end the shutdown.West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito said that she could support ending the shutdown provided border wall talks continued.Pat Roberts of Kansas said that shutdowns ""never work"" and only turned affected federal workers into ""pawns"" and that, although the time had not yet come for Senate Republicans to override any possible Trump veto and end the shutdown, ""we\'re getting pretty close.""Johnny Isakson of Georgia echoed that sentiment, saying that support for McConnell\'s refusal to support bills that do not include funding for a wall would not last indefinitely: ""There\'s a time when that may run out.""\n\nOn January 16, McConnell again blocked the House appropriation bills to reopen the government from being considered on the Senate floor.The following day, McConnell blocked consideration of bills to reopen most of the closed government agencies for a third time.On January 23, McConnell blocked a bill to reopen most of the government for the fourth time.\n\nOn January 22, McConnell stated that the Senate would be voting on two different bills to end the shutdown on January 24.The first vote is on a bill to reopen the government which includes Trump\'s proposal to provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and temporary protections to some immigration classes.The other bill is a three-week continuing resolution to fund 25% of the government through February 8.\n\nOn January 22, Senator Mark Warner introduced a bill to keep the federal government running in the event of future shutdown events.The bill is called the ""Stop Shutdowns Transferring Unnecessary Pain and Inflicting Damage in the Coming Years Act"" or the ""Stop STUPIDITY Act"".\n\nOn January 24, the Senate held two votes on competing Democratic and Republican proposals to end the shutdown.The Democratic proposal was largely similar to the measure that had previously passed the Senate unanimously in the 115th Congress, and then been passed by the Democratic-controlled House in the 116th Congress.It provided funding for the government with no money for the border wall.The Republican proposal incorporated Trump\'s proposal, which would fund a border wall; temporarily extend TPS and DACA for three years, but would substantially narrow eligibility for DACA; and make significant legal changes to make it more difficult for persons escaping violence and persecution to be granted asylum in the United States.Neither proposal was able to attain the 60 votes needed for passage.The Trump plan failed in a 50–47 vote.The Democratic plan failed in a 52–44 vote.Most Republicans voted for Trump\'s plan and against the Democratic plan.Most Democrats voted for the Democratic plan and against Trump\'s plan.Republicans Tom Cotton and Mike Lee voted against both plans.Democrat Joe Manchin and Republicans Lamar Alexander, Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, Johnny Isakson, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney voted for both plans.Not voting on either were Republicans Rand Paul and Jim Risch and Democrat Jacky Rosen.Republican Richard Burr voted for Trump\'s plan and did not vote on the Democratic plan.\n\nOn January 25, House Democrats prepared a compromise proposal to reopen the government, which would provide $5 billion for border security but no wall construction.However, the shutdown ended the same day.\n\nOn January 4, after the new Congress was sworn-in and Pelosi regained the speakership, she and Schumer, as well as congressional Republican leadership met with Trump at the White House.Pelosi and Schumer argued that the shutdown needed to end and reported that Trump refused.They said that Trump threatened to ""keep the government closed for a very long period of time.Months or even years.""Later that day, Trump admitted to ""absolutely"" making that threat, adding, ""I\'m very proud of doing what I\'m doing.""Trump then said that he was considering declaring a national emergency to use military funding for the wall.At the meeting, Trump reprimanded his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney for attempting to propose a compromise between Trump\'s $5.7 billion demand for a border wall and the Democrats\' proposal of $1.3 billion for border security.\n\nTrump addressed the nation from the Oval Office at 9 p.m. EST on January 8, in a nationally televised address broadcast on both network and cable television.In his speech, Trump asserted that there was a ""growing humanitarian and security crisis"" on the Mexico–United States border that could only be solved by appropriating $5.7 billion for construction of a steel wall.Trump did not make any new proposals in his speech to break the impasse.Immediately after Trump\'s speech, Schumer and Pelosi delivered a response on behalf of the Democrats, in which they demanded an end to the shutdown and said: ""President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government.""\n\nTrump met with congressional leadership again on January 9, in a meeting lasting 14 minutes.Trump asked Pelosi, ""Will you agree to my wall?"" and when she replied that she would not, Trump said ""bye-bye"" and walked out of the meeting, later declaring it ""a total waste of time"".Schumer accused Trump of throwing a ""temper tantrum"" and slamming his hands on the table.Trump rebuked Schumer\'s comments on Twitter.Vice President Mike Pence and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that Trump remained calm and never raised his voice.On January 10, Pelosi described the preceding day\'s meeting with Trump as ""a setup"" staged by White House aides so that Trump could walk out of the meeting.Pelosi described Trump as ""un-presidential""; accused him of ""exploiting this situation in a way that enhances his power""; and said: ""I don\'t think he really wants a solution.I think he loves the distraction.""\n\nAfter Trump walked out of the January 9 meeting with congressional Democratic leaders, no further negotiations were conducted.Several Republican senators met in the office of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, after the meeting to discuss a compromise to end the shutdown.They discussed agreeing to Trump\'s demand for border wall funding and offering the Democrats help for Dreamers, refugee protections and extensions to H-2B visas.On January 13, Graham proposed that Trump agree to a congressional vote to reopen the government pending the resumption of negotiations.Graham suggested that if Trump and congressional Democrats did not come to an agreement at that time, Trump could declare a national emergency.Trump rejected this proposal the next day.\n\nOn January 19, Trump proposed a temporary extension of the two programs that protect about 700,000 immigrants from deportation—Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)—in exchange for funding for the border wall.The protections would be temporary, with no path to citizenship.Trump had previously revoked TPS for people from a number of Latin American and African countries, and taken steps to rescind DACA.In his remarks at the White House, Trump referred to a ""barrier"" rather than a ""wall"" and indicated that he aimed to erect ""steel barriers in high priority locations"" rather than ""a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea.""\n\nIn addition to funding a border wall, the 1,300-page Republican bill released after Trump made his proposal would make major changes to U.S. immigration policy (which were not included in Trump\'s public announcement).The legislation would severely restrict the ability of children from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to apply for asylum in the United States.Specifically, participation in the Central American Minors Program would be subject to an annual cap and migrant children would be barred from applying for asylum in person at the border, and only migrant children with a ""qualified"" parent in the U.S. would be eligible to apply.The bill would also create a new, more burdensome application process for TPS holders, and would exclude TPS holders from Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen.The American Immigration Lawyers Association government relations director said that the proposal ""would categorically block tens of thousands of children from ever applying for asylum,"" while a Cato Institute immigration analyst wrote that the proposal would not extend DACA, but rather replace it with ""a totally different program that will exclude untold thousands of Dreamers who would have been eligible under DACA.""\n\nDemocrats rejected Trump\'s proposal.In a speech on the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""The president\'s proposal is one-sided, harshly partisan and was made in bad faith.The asylum changes are a poison pill, if there ever was one.""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said extending the DACA proposal temporarily was ""unacceptable"" and a ""non-starter"" because it did not ""represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people\'s lives.""Analysts pointed out that Trump had previously rejected a deal that would have provided funding for the border wall in exchange for further protection for DACA recipients.Conversely, Republicans reacted positively to Trump\'s proposal, and Mitch McConnell said he would bring it to a vote in the Senate.\n\nDuring the shutdown, on January 8 in a press conference, a reporter asked Trump if he was considering declaring a national emergency, to which Trump replied, ""I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want"" and suggested that he could declare an emergency.After this, Trump repeatedly threatened to declare a national emergency to unilaterally order wall construction without congressional authorization.Some of Trump\'s advisors, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, reportedly attempted to dissuade him from doing so.Administration officials considered diverting hurricane-relief and wildfire-relief funds from a $13.9 billion February 2018 emergency supplemental appropriations bill (for disaster relief in Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California, among other places) in order to fund a wall, and directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to look into this possibility.\n\nAn attempt by Trump to invoke emergency powers would almost certainly have prompted a lengthy legal challenge in court.Democrats responded that Trump lacked the authority to declare a national emergency; Representative Adam Schiff called it a ""non-starter"" and said that ""if Harry Truman couldn\'t nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this President doesn\'t have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion dollar wall on the border.""Democratic Representative Nydia Velázquez said the notion of redirecting disaster-relief funds to a border wall was ""beyond appalling"".Presidents have declared emergencies in the past, but none has ""involved funding a policy goal after failing to win congressional approval"".Yale Law School professor Bruce Ackerman wrote that the declaration of a national emergency to build a wall as Trump suggested would be unconstitutional and illegal.Other scholars, such as Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice, believed that Trump could make a colorable argument that diverting military-construction appropriations for border-wall construction was legal, but that doing so would be an abuse of power.Law professor Ilya Somin stated that in the unlikely case that Trump succeeded in using the emergency powers in this way, it would set a dangerous precedent, which Republicans would come to regret next time the president was a Democrat.\n\nOn January 11, Trump—while maintaining he has the authority to do so anytime—said he was not in any rush to declare a national emergency to secure wall funding, saying he would rather see Congress ""do its job"" and that the Democrats ""should come back and vote.""The next day he again threatened to use emergency powers if Democrats did not ""come to their senses.""\n\nOn January 16, Pelosi sent a letter to Trump that indicated the House would be unavailable for the 2019 State of the Union Address that was scheduled for January 29.Pelosi wrote, ""Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government reopens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has reopened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on Jan. 29.""The delivery of the State of the Union address had been delayed or substantially changed on only two occasions since 1913.In a letter sent to the Speaker the next day, Trump said she would not be allowed to take military transport aircraft on scheduled visits to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan.Trump replied, ""We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the shutdown is over.""Pelosi and a congressional delegation had planned on visiting overseas American military personnel.\n\nOn January 23, Trump sent a letter to Pelosi insisting that there were no security concerns and that he would hold the State of the Union Address as scheduled.Trump wrote, ""Therefore, I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and Congress of the United States of America regarding the State of our Union.""In a letter sent in reply, Pelosi stated that the House would not consider a concurrent resolution to authorize the State of the Union Address in the House Chamber until the shutdown ended, writing, ""Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened.""\n\nTrump later stated he would look for an alternative, but then retracted that statement in a pair of tweets announcing that he would wait until the end of the shutdown to give the address in the House Chamber.\n\nOn January 25, Trump announced his support for a three-week funding measure that would reopen the government until February 15.The deal, which also moved forward with long-term Department of Homeland Security funding, did not include funds for a wall.As expected, the agreement provided federal employees with back pay.Both the Senate and House of Representatives passed the funding measure by voice vote, sending the resolution to the President\'s desk.Trump signed the bill the same day, ending the shutdown.\n\nLater in January, Republican senators voted unanimously against a bill to provide back pay to federal contractors.\n\nWithout legislation enacted by February 15, a new partial shutdown would have begun, three weeks after the last ended.A bipartisan group of senators and representatives reached an agreement ""in principle"" on February 11, but Trump did not say whether he would sign it.Included was $1.375 billion for 55 miles of steel border fencing.On February 13, it was reported that, against the wishes of Democratic leaders and many Republicans, Trump was blocking the provision of back pay to federal contractors who were still out of pocket from the shutdown.Both houses passed the bill February 14 with enough votes to override a veto if that happened.\n\nOn February 15, at the White House Rose Garden, Trump announced that he had signed the spending bill to keep the government open.He also declared a national emergency, hoping to get access to $8 billion to use for border security.\n\nAgencies funded by two ""minibus"" appropriations bills passed in September 2018 were not affected by the shutdown.About 380,000 federal employees were furloughed, and an additional 420,000 employees for the affected agencies were expected to work with their pay delayed until the end of the shutdown, totaling 800,000 workers affected out of 2.1 million civilian non-postal federal employees.As only about a quarter of the government was shut down, many people who are not federal employees did not fully realize the effects of the shutdown.\n\nAccording to and , these were the affected agencies:\n\nDepartment of State Department of the Treasury Department of Justice Most of the Department of the Interior Department of Agriculture Department of Commerce Department of Housing and Urban Development Department of Transportation Department of Homeland Security Some Department of Health and Human Services agencies Food and Drug Administration Indian Health Service Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Superfund Research Program Executive Office of the President Most independent agencies Judicial Branch\n\nUnaffected agencies include, according to and :\n\nDepartment of Defense Department of Labor Most of the Department of Health and Human Services Department of Energy Department of Education Department of Veterans Affairs Some Department of the Interior agencies Bureau of Reclamation Central Utah Project District of Columbia (excluding courts) Legislative Branch Social Security Administration Nuclear Regulatory Commission Appalachian Regional Commission Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board Delta Regional Authority Denali Commission Northern Border Regional Commission Southeast Crescent Regional Commission Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board American Battle Monuments Commission U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Cemeterial Expenses of the Army, including Arlington National Cemetery and Soldiers\' and Airmen\'s Home National Cemetery Armed Forces Retirement Home Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System Fund Intelligence Community Management Account Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled Corporation for National and Community Service Corporation for Public Broadcasting Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission Institute of Museum and Library Services Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission Medicare Payment Advisory Commission National Council on Disability National Labor Relations Board National Mediation Board Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission Railroad Retirement Board\n\nJobs affected included staff throughout the United States, not just DC area employees.FBI agents, federal corrections officers, FDA inspectors, NASA employees, TSA staff, Border Patrol staff and CBP officers, census staff, National Park Service staff, members of the Coast Guard, and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers either worked without pay or were furloughed, with increasing numbers of unpaid essential employees failing to show up for work.\n\nOn January 11, 800,000 workers for agencies shutdown or furloughed missed their first paycheck.Federal workers normally receive pay on federal holidays, which include Christmas, New Year\'s Day and potentially Martin Luther King Jr. Day.The shutdown affected the employees\' entitlement to paid holidays due to the shutdown.Unemployment assistance to federal workers furloughed under the government shutdown varied by locality.Only non-reporting workers were eligible for assistance, whereas furloughed workers who still reported to work were not.Workers who received unemployment assistance were required pay it back after the shut down ended and they received backpay.Some furloughed workers sought other employment opportunities while they were idled.However, external employment must meet agency-specific ethics guidelines, and mandatory reviews of external employment were also curtailed as most ethics officials were also furloughed.Federal employees were not able to use vacation or sick leave during the shutdown so scheduled holiday vacation time either became unpaid if the worker was deemed non-essential or was cancelled if the worker was deemed essential.In many cases unused leave over a certain threshold expired at year-end, but employees who had leave scheduled in advance of the shutdown did not have ""use or lose"" leave balances deducted from their accrued leave.Many furloughed employees took to crowd-funding campaigns to raise cash to replace missed paychecks, but these types of solicitations also run afoul of government ethics rules.\n\nAs furloughed federal workers and their families shared stories of their hardships, such as not being able to meet rent or mortgage payments and missed bills, the hashtag ""#ShutdownStories"" went viral on social media.The federal government\'s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) responded by publishing sample letters that employees could send to their creditors.One read, in part, ""I am a Federal employee who has recently been furloughed due to a lack of funding of my agency.Because of this, my income has been severely cut and I am unable to pay the entire cost of my mortgage, along with my other expenses.""Other federal workers reached out to other news outlets to share stories about having to stretch their budgets and the impact of the shutdown on their families.In addition to being unable to meet rent or pay bills, many federal workers around the country were unable to pay for groceries and turned to food banks.One federal prison guard in Louisiana attempted suicide after posting about the financial pressures of the shutdown on Facebook.\n\nThe OPM also suggested that employees who had landlords write: ""I would like to discuss with you the possibility of trading my services to perform maintenance (e.g. painting, carpentry work) in exchange for partial rent payments"" and suggested those who lacked funds to pay bills should hire personal attorneys to assist them.Other organizations also posted advice on how to ""find supplemental income""; the Coast Guard suggested that Coast Guard members ""have a garage sale, offer to watch children, walk pets or house sit"" while furloughed.\n\nOn January 4, The Washington Post reported that because the shutdown was triggered by the failure to enact spending bills that continued a federal government pay freeze, hundreds of senior Trump administration political appointees would receive a roughly $10,000 pay raise the following day.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the pending pay raise was an ""unnecessary byproduct of the shutdown.""\n\nOn January 10, the Senate approved by unanimous consent a bill (S.24, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019) providing that furloughed federal employees would receive back pay for the period of the furlough once appropriations were restored; the bill was approved the next day by the House on a vote of 411–7.Trump signed the bill into law on January 16.\n\nNative American tribes were not paid for treaties negotiated with the United States government.These treaties specified that the federal government must provide funding for health clinics, employee salaries, education, infrastructure and other services, which were not paid during the shutdown.Native lands are ""owned, managed and maintained by the federal government.""Native Americans who receive a per capita check for profits from oil and gas sales from tribal land did not receive check for the month of February.Roads were not plowed on tribal land, and some areas received significant snowfall.This caused people of the Navajo Nation to become trapped inside their homes.Food services, which fed 90,000 Native Americans in 2017, were halted.\n\nNative American communities had a high percentage of individuals who worked for the federal government and lost income during the shutdown.In North and South Dakota, one of the largest employers is the Indian Health Service.The Chippewa tribe reported an economic loss of nearly $100,000 daily in funds that the federal government was supposed to provide as a treaty obligation.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was closed for the shutdown.However, 60 percent of the Indian Health Service (IHS) continued to work without pay.IHS provides care for 2.2 million Native Americans and on January 23, began to deny care that was not considered ""life threatening.""The Bureau of Indian Education was able to stay open because it was funded on a different schedule.Unlike other government shutdowns, there was little outreach from the Trump Administration to Native Americans and the Chippewa tribe in Michigan was given a 24-hour notice that the shutdown would take place and affect the tribe.\n\nThe only military branch that was affected by the shutdown was the Coast Guard because it was part of the Department of Homeland Security, while the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps were all funded through the Department of Defense.Officials were able to fund payment on December 31, 2018, but were not able to do so for the paychecks of January 15 and 30, 2019, along with the pay and benefits for civilian workers and retirees.During the shutdown, the Coast Guard continued to engage in patrolling the American coastline and carrying out overseas missions in locations such as the Persian Gulf along with the Navy and in the Caribbean.Other issues arose in the payment processes for Coast Guard members Tricare Health and Dental Program payments, although the individuals were still covered.\n\nMilitary schools, such as the Coast Guard Academy and the National War College, lost funding due to the shutdown and the schools had to work to find funds to pay professors.\n\nAlthough the Department of Defense was not shut down, the February 4, 2019, date for release of the Pentagon\'s 2020 budget was delayed by at least one month.This had repercussions on the interim period which is usually used by Pentagon planners for adjustments before the 2020 fiscal year which will begin in October 2019.The White House Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the Pentagon request, was shut down when the Pentagon budget arrived in December, and remained inactive, so no work was done on the budget.\n\nOn February 25, 2019, the Pentagon\'s counter-drug (interdiction) funding has up to $85 million not yet obligated, but that money was planned for the known corridors in El Paso, Tucson, Yuma, and El Centro for border fencing, lighting, and road projects, so any funds which might possibly be intended for additional projects elsewhere along the border must be obligated by September 30, 2019, in order not to affect the known corridors.Otherwise appropriations above the $85 million not yet obligated for additional interdiction border projects will have to be approved by additional Congressional appropriations, to reach the $2 billion target.\n\nA January 28, 2019 Congressional Budget Office report estimated that the 35-day partial government shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion, including $3 billion in permanent losses; the CBO estimate excluded indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.The furloughing of 145,000 federal workers and 112,500 federal contractors in the Washington Metropolitan Area cost the regional economy $119 million each day, or 7.3% of the region\'s total output.That reduced GDP by over $2.8 billion in the Washington DC area alone.The shutdown also had a noticeable impact on hunger in the national capital region: food pantries in Washington DC and Northern Virginia reported an increase of around 10% in the number of people coming to pick up groceries, with most of that increase coming from federal workers and contractors.\n\nFitch Ratings warned that an extended shutdown might lead to a downgrade in the U.S.\'s Triple-A credit rating if lawmakers were unable to pass a budget or manage the debt ceiling.That in turn would make borrowing more costly for companies and American households, because it is the benchmark for many other lines of credit.The only time the U.S. credit rating has been downgraded by S&P was during the United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011.\n\nSome economists believed that an extended shutdown would weaken consumer confidence and heighten the risk of pushing the U.S. economy into a recession.Between 800,000 federal government employees and some 4 million federal contractors, the shutdown directly affected nearly 3% of the labor force of the United States; in a typical recession, unemployment increases 2–4%.The reduction in spending by those households combined with the reduction of government services could have macroeconomic results similar to a typical recession.The shutdown had an adverse effect on the budgets of state and local governments, as states covered some federal services (particularly the most vulnerable) during the shutdown.\n\nBy mid-January 2019, the White House Council of Economic Advisors estimated that each week of the shutdown reduced GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, the equivalent of 1.2 points per quarter.CEA chairman Kevin Hassett later acknowledged that GDP growth could decline to zero in the first quarter of 2019 if the shutdown lasted the entire quarter.\n\nAs tax season began in the United States on January 28, some 46,000 Internal Revenue Service workers were called back to work to ensure tax refunds and returns were not affected by the shutdown.The recalled workers allowed the department to continue operations that were automatic and those deemed necessary for the safety of human life or protection of government property, such as processing electronic returns, returns with payments, mailing tax forms, appeals, criminal law enforcement investigations and technical support.\n\nDuring the shutdown, 95% of federal staff for the USDA\'s Food and Nutrition Services were furloughed.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the food-stamp program, could be funded through a $3 billion contingency fund appropriated by Congress in 2018; if the shutdown had continued through March 2019, those funds would have been exhausted, leaving some 38 million Americans without food stamps and endangering food security.Concerns were raised that continuation of the shutdown could delay the issuance of some $140 billion in tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees most of the food supply in the U.S.In early January, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner, reported that the FDA suspended food inspections.He noted that inspection of foreign food was continuing as ""almost normal,"" because they are considered vital.Around January 14, ""high-risk"" food inspections resumed.As of January 22, 2019, 46 percent of the FDA were working, though 20 percent of them were working without pay.During the shutdown, two new recalls for contamination with Listeria or Salmonella took place.Consumer advocacy groups advised of food safety issues during the shutdown.Food safety attorney, Bill Marler, advocated against eating ""fresh, uncooked products on the market place.""Because there was a shortage of FDA inspectors, many imported perishable items, such as produce or flowers, were at risk of spoilage.Meat and some egg products are inspected by the USDA\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service.Federal legislation required those inspectors to remain working without pay.\n\nSchool administrations raised concern about how to feed children who purchase food at the schools for lunch, as funding concerns caused some districts to conserve food and funding.Many limited the amount or variation of foods available for the children to purchase, and alerted parents to the concerns and the limited availability of some of the items.Most schools affected were in high-poverty areas, and depended on federally funded lunch programs, such as the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) a federal grant established by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 and operated through the Department of Agriculture.Some 22 million students in nearly 100,000 schools received school meals through that operation.\n\nAs with the January 2018 shutdown, national parks were expected to be open to the extent practical, though there would be no staff and buildings would be closed.The shutdown affected national parks unevenly, some were accessible with bare-bones staffing levels, some operated with money from states or charitable groups, and others were locked off.Diane Regas, president and chief executive of the Trust for Public Land, called upon Trump to close all national parks to protect the public: by the third week of the shutdown, three people had died in national parks.This number was reported as being within \'usual\' levels.At Yosemite National Park, on January 4, 2019, a death from a fall went unreported for a week.\n\nBy January 1, 2019, the problems of neglected trash pileup, overflowing public toilets, and access to first aid were repeated across the Park system.Health and safety concerns were raised, with concerns by scientists that the expansive amount of garbage and human waste could impact water and soil quality, or cause damage to animals in the parks.Other issues that arose due to the shutdown included illegal campsites, protected agriculture being damaged, damaging of government property and trespassing on foot and by vehicle.\n\nNew York kept the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open, as it did during the January 2018 shutdown.Arizona and Utah were able to keep Grand Canyon National Park, Zion National Park, Arches National Park, and Bryce Canyon National Park open and provided services including public restrooms, shuttles and trash collection.Utah\'s funding included visitor centers.The sites closed outright in the southwest alone included Bandelier National Monument and Valles Caldera National Preserve in northern New Mexico, White Sands National Monument in southern New Mexico, Petrified Forest National Park in northern Arizona and Casa Grande Ruins National Monument in south-central Arizona.Access to major parts of Sequoia and Kings Canyon parks were closed, and at Joshua Tree National Park, the administration policy of leaving parks open to visitors despite the staff furloughs resulted in park damage, including the toppling of protected trees.In Texas, Big Bend National Park had no visitor services, such as restrooms.Some trailheads were closed.Regulations continued to be enforced, as the park remained open.Visitors were reminded to remove their own trash and toilet paper.The Alamo remained open but no NPS services were available at the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park.Channel Islands National Park remained open to public access, although services normally provided by the national park service were instead provided by Island Packers Cruises, the company normally in charge of ferries to the islands.\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration closed immediately on December 22, 2018.The Library of Congress, the U.S. Botanic Garden, the Capitol Visitor Center, and the U.S. Capitol Building remained open as they were funded by the 2019 Legislative Branch appropriations bill.The Smithsonian Institution operated on ""prior-year funds"" through January 1, 2019.On January 2, 2019, the Smithsonian Institution initiated an orderly shutdown of all its facilities, including 19 museums in Washington, D.C., and New York City, the National Zoo, and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.The following day, the National Gallery of Art was closed.The National Zoo also closed on January 3, 2019.Tourism attendance on the National Mall was affected.On January 5, 2019, acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt directed the diversion of fee revenue defined by the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to be used to fund minimal maintenance activities so as to preserve access to highly visited parks.\n\nAccording to a January 12, 2019, article in The Economist, on January 11, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was unable to pay its workers who had not been paid since December 22; 55% more of them called in sick than in January 2018.\n\nAs the air traffic controllers were deemed essential employees, they were required to work without pay.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents air traffic controllers, filed a lawsuit against the federal government for the shutdown on January 11, 2019, claiming that requiring 16,000 air traffic controllers to work without being paid violated their constitutional rights and federal minimum wage law.That was the third lawsuit filed against the federal government since the beginning of the shutdown.\n\nAirline and aircraft safety inspectors, on the other hand, were deemed nonessential and furloughed.A news report on January 12, 2019, stated that the Federal Aviation Administration had returned 500 furloughed safety inspectors back to work and would return more to work in the following weeks.As the airline and aircraft safety inspectors were furloughed, the certification process of the Airbus A220 in the US was stalled.Delta Air Lines was forced to delay the launch of the new aircraft, and to use other models of aircraft to serve those routes that was supposed to be served with A220.Many TSA employees also called out sick, most of them because they were trying to find other jobs that would provide immediate paychecks.\n\nThe shutdown initially prevented the National Transportation Safety Board from assisting the Mexican government\'s investigation of the 2018 Puebla helicopter crash that killed a state governor and senator; an exception allowed the NTSB to assist with the Mexican government in the investigation along with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.The NTSB also had to delay several investigations until the government reopened and only continued investigations into accidents that were considered the most serious.Issues in receiving certification and oversight from the FAA led to a month-long delay in the commencement of passenger service at Paine Field in Everett, Washington.\n\nAs the shutdown continued into its fourth week, the unions representing airline pilots, flight attendants and air traffic controllers issued a statement asserting, ""we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play"" because of the shutdown.\n\nSome airports such as the Philadelphia International Airport, launched food and item donations for federal employees who were affected by the shutdown.Other airports such as the Miami International Airport, and the George Bush International Airport, closed down terminals in order to spread out the TSA workers that were available.\n\nOn January 25, flights destined for LaGuardia Airport in New York were halted to a groundstop by FAA officials due to staffing shortages directly as a result of the shutdown.As a result, several flights to and from neighboring airports in the Northeast, specifically Philadelphia and Newark, suffered significant delays of their own.Soon after that, appropriations passed and the government reopened.\n\nThe shutdown delayed software updates to the Boeing 737 MAX airplane which may have caused the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.\n\nDuring the shutdown, court-appointed private lawyers who represent indigent defendants worked without pay.The Federal Judiciary initially had a goal of sustaining paid operations through January 18, 2019.It said it would run out of money to sustain court operations no earlier than January 25, but perhaps as late as February 1.Failing funding, the Judiciary would operate under the terms of the Antideficiency Act.This Act does not allow federal agencies to expend federal funds before an appropriation, nor to accept any voluntary services.The judiciary had 33,000 employees nationwide.Under the Constitution, Supreme Court Justices, appeals court judges and district judges would continue to be paid.\n\nThe shutdown caused many delays and disruptions in cases.Budgets were watched carefully to be able to pay public defenders, DNA testing, informants, and travel costs to interview victims and witnesses.Staffing issues also brought about concerns and constraints with prisons lacking the staff to safely hold attorney-client visits, and caused a delay in bail hearings.\n\nAgents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed in a report released on January 22, 2019, by the FBI Agents Association, that several different investigations were compromised by the shutdown.The report was called ""Voices from the Field"" and was 72 pages long.FBI agents were unable to pay Confidential Human Sources which risks losing that informant permanently.Some FBI divisions no longer have Spanish-speaking staff on hand and could not work with informants who only speak Spanish.Some agents reported that they did not have the funds to assist in joint operations with local law enforcement.\n\nFederal law enforcement agencies working on Native American land worked without pay through the shutdown.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was forced to cancel a trip to the United States/Mexico border in early January due to the shutdown.DHS was also unable to inspect Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities during the shutdown to ensure that immigrants were being held in facilities appropriately.During the shutdown, the federal government\'s e-Verify system—a system for employers to check the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States—was halted.\n\nDuring the shutdown, a wave of Domain Name System (DNS) attacks on government sites was detected by Homeland Security.The attacks were serious because these Internet sites could be hijacked.\n\nOfficial websites for agencies were rendered insecure or inaccessible through the shutdown, as the expired digital certificates were not renewed.On January 23, DHS asked all government agencies to secure their DNS records; however, many agencies were not able to respond quickly to this request.\n\nExecutive and legislative affairs of the local government of the District of Columbia continued operating through the shutdown, due to a provision previously enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017.The District\'s local court system, including the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, are part of the federal judiciary.Thus, they were partially shut down, preventing District residents from accessing services such as marriage licensing.The District of Columbia government said it would take over trash collection and snow plowing operations for National Park Service facilities in Washington.\n\nThe shutdown also interfered with the response to the 2018 Sunda Strait tsunami, as the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta\'s Twitter account was unable to tweet updates, and the United States Geological Survey was unable to provide data on the tsunami.The American weather model, the GFS, suffered a significant drop in forecast quality when a data format change during the shutdown prevented certain weather data from being recognized by the GFS, and the shutdown prevented the bug from being corrected.\n\nBy mid-day Thursday, January 3, 2019, the FCC had suspended operations.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai canceled his trip to the Consumer Electronics Show.The FTC also suspended certain online operations.The EPA and Department of Energy\'s Energy Star website was not available for the duration of the shutdown.\n\nMakers of alcoholic beverages were unable to receive approval from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau for new labels and recipes during the shutdown.\n\nBased on the recalculation of their operating reserves, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) would have had to cease patent operations in the second week of February.A cadre of personnel was allocated to continue receiving patent applications, receive payments, and maintain the IT infrastructure.Even though the USPTO is self-funded, a Congressional appropriation is required to permit the USPTO to spend money.The pipeline of patent applications at the time took 15.8 months for a response from an examiner.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution shortened to two days and downscaled its scheduled ten-day 2019 Folklife Festival on the National Mall because of the shutdown\'s effects.Sabrina Motley, the director of the festival, said that initially, crucial funding for the June—July event arrived later than expected, slowing preparations.Motley stated: ""The government opened back up, but it took a while for systems to come back online. ...We looked at our production schedule, and it became clear we would need more time than we had.""\n\nThe White House residence staff who stage public receptions were among those furloughed, with a minimal staff continuing to work unpaid for the first family.In the midst of the shutdown Trump invited the Clemson Tigers football team to a White House dinner reception on January 14 in recognition of their College Football Playoff National Championship win.On the morning of the reception Trump announced that he intended to serve fast food hamburgers and pizza to the team, a remark that some commentators interpreted as a joke.That evening Trump welcomed the team in the State Dining Room with a buffet of fast food and pizza from McDonald\'s, Wendy\'s and other restaurant chains, which he stated that he had paid for personally.Trump served fast food to other visiting athletes later that year, after the shutdown had ended.\n\nOn January 10, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with several other unions, announced plans to protest the government shutdown at 1:00pm EST in Washington, DC.Leaders of the National Federation of Federal Employees stated they had hoped that bringing federal workers to the President\'s doorstep would show him that it was the individual workers that the shutdown was hurting the most.President Trump had left to visit the US–Mexican border in Texas earlier in the day.\n\nSimilar protests took place in Philadelphia and St. Louis, among other cities.On January 15, representatives for Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, and Vietnam Veterans of America along with others called for an end to shutdown, but avoided placing any blame on political parties.\n\nShortly after the protests, the American Federation of Government Employees sued the Trump administration to challenge the arrangements for work without pay during the shutdown.A similar suit was raised and won during the 2013 Federal Government shutdown.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association also sued the Trump administration, as the shutdown allegedly violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by failing to pay the workers at least a minimum wage during the shutdown.\n\nAs the salaries for members of Congress are written into permanent law and not funded through annual appropriations, the government shutdown did not affect their salaries.Senators and Representatives were still paid their biweekly salaries of $6,700 towards at least $174,000 a year.\n\nSeveral Democratic and Republican Senators and Representatives said they would donate or refuse their salary during the shutdown.Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw stated that he would refuse his salary, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto indicated she would donate hers to a Nevada charity, Senator Mazie Hirono said she would donate her salary to Hawaii food banks, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would give hers to refugee non-profit HIAS, New York Congressman Max Rose stated that he would give his salary to charity and outgoing Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota pledged hers to charity, along with her Republican colleague John Hoeven.Republican senator Kevin Cramer, who defeated Heidi Heitkamp in the 2018 midterm elections, refused to donate his salary, calling the move ""gimmicky"".Representative Brian Fitzpatrick urged all members of Congress to decline their paychecks.He said, ""If you\'re in Congress, don\'t just delay your pay -- forfeit it, write a check back to the US Treasury.Then you\'ll feel the pain of federal workers.""\n\nBy January 17, 2019, 102 members of Congress—20 Senators and 82 Representatives— chose to decline their paychecks or were donating their paychecks to charity.\n\nDuring the shutdown, many federal workers used food banks and food pantries in order to feed themselves and their families.Many food pantries waived certain restrictions in order to help government workers have access to food.During the shutdown, the Salvation Army Emergency Disasters Services program provided meals for federal workers.Chef Jose Andres created the #ChefsForFeds program to feed federal workers in Washington, D.C. and by January 21, made announcements to expand the program nationwide.\n\nSome states such as California, offered furloughed employees unemployment benefits, although the Trump administration allegedly told states that they could not do so with federal funds.Organizations such as state Attorney Generals offices, and credit card companies posted statements to their websites to offer a means to help to consolidate debt, meet mortgages or other payments such as child support or tuition.An employment law firm offered pro bono legal advice to furloughed federal employees.School districts opened up free or reduced lunch options for children of federal employees, and looked into other options to aid parents amid concerns that financial stress at home would adversely affect families and children.Every mainline denomination in America has contributed to efforts to provide relief.One Baptist church emptied its entire disaster fund to aid federal employees.\n\nOn January 24, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross downplayed the financial difficulties faced by the 800,000 federal workers affected by the shutdown, stating that they should borrow money to ""tide them over"" until the shutdown ends.Critics and Democrats criticized the statement as inappropriate, noting that Ross\' own net worth is estimated at almost $700 million, accusing him of being out of touch with the workers.Ross also said that he ""did not understand"" why people who were not getting paid due to the shutdown were visiting food banks.When asked about Ross\' statement, Trump suggested that grocery stores will ""work along"" with the government by voluntarily extending credit to those who are out of funds to buy food.National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow characterized the shutdown as a ""glitch"" and suggested that federal workers who were required to work without pay were ""volunteering"" to work for their love of the country and ""presumably their allegiance to President Trump.""\n\nIn a video message to staff, FBI director Christopher Wray stated, ""Making some people stay home when they don\'t want to, and making others show up without pay, it\'s mind-boggling, it\'s shortsighted and it\'s unfair.It takes a lot to get me angry, but I\'m about as angry as I\'ve been in a long, long time.""\n\nLara Trump, a daughter-in-law of the President, drew outrage after an interview in which she stated that while ""It\'s not fair to you..."" the shutdown was ""...a little bit of pain, but it\'s going to be for the future of our country, and their children and their grandchildren and generations after them will thank them for their sacrifice right now.""Her comments drew criticism by politicians, celebrities, and the general public who felt the advisor and spokeswoman for the Trump 2020 campaign was out of touch, however Lara Trump later claimed the comments were taken out of context.\n\nIn January 2019, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that 56% of the responding public opposed a wall while 39% favored it, and 45% viewed the situation at the border as a crisis.The numbers were similar to the poll in December 2018 yet a later poll by ABC News showed that as the partial shutdown entered its fourth week support for building a wall was increasing.A poll done through YouGov between December 23–25, 2018, reported that 51% of respondents thought Trump deserved ""a lot"" of the blame, 44% thought congressional Democrats and 39% thought congressional Republicans.Similar results were reported by a December 21–25 survey done by Reuters and Ipsos in which 47% of respondents said that the shutdown was the President\'s fault and 33% blamed Congressional Democrats.\n\nOver the course of the shutdown, Trump\'s approval rating marginally declined while his disapproval rating marginally increased.His net approval rating was by the middle of January 2019 at its lowest point since February 2018.On December 27, 2018, it was reported that Trump\'s approval rating of registered voters was at 39%, with 56% disapproval.Broken down the rating was split across party lines, with Republicans reporting an 80% approval rate while Democrats and independents reported a 90% and 57% disapproval rating, respectively.The poll was conducted through Morning Consult between December 21–23.The poll also reported that 43% of respondents blamed Trump for the shutdown, with 31% blaming congressional Democrats and 7% congressional Republicans.Another poll through The New York Times Upshot/Siena College reported that 89% of voters\' views on Trump and the wall were aligned, suggesting that support for the wall was a function of support for Trump.\n\nThe Washington Post–ABC News poll published on January 13, 2019, found that a larger number of Americans blamed Trump and congressional Republicans than congressional Democrats for the shutdown.A PBS NewsHour–Marist poll found that on January 15, 2019, a majority of Americans thought that President Trump was to blame for the shutdown.A January 2019 poll conducted by telephone for CBS News found that 70% of Americans polled did not want a government shutdown over the issue of building a border wall; 66% believed that Trump should agree to a budget without wall funding.\n\nPresidency of Donald Trump Donald Trump January 2018 United

51,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018–2019 United States federal government shutdown', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The United States federal government shutdown from midnight EST on December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019 (35 days) was the longest government shutdown in history and the second and final federal government shutdown involving furloughs during the presidency of Donald Trump.It occurred when the 115th Congress and Trump could not agree on an appropriations bill to fund the operations of the federal government for the 2019 fiscal year, or a temporary continuing resolution that would extend the deadline for passing a bill.The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal departments or agencies from conducting non-essential operations without appropriations legislation in place.As a result, nine executive departments with around 800,000 employees had to shut down partially or in full, affecting about one-fourth of government activities and causing employees to be furloughed or required to work without being paid.The Congressional Budget Office estimated the shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion USD, excluding indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.\n\nThe shutdown stemmed from an impasse over Trump\'s demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall.In December 2018, the Senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the bill appeared likely to be approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Trump.After Trump faced heavy criticism from some right-wing media outlets and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to ""build the wall"", he announced that he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund its construction.As a result, the House passed a stopgap bill with funding for the wall, but it was blocked in the Senate by the threat of a Democratic filibuster.\n\nIn January 2019, representatives elected in the November 2018 election took office, giving the Democrats a majority in the House.The House immediately voted to approve the appropriations bill that had previously passed the Senate unanimously (which included no funding for the wall).For several weeks, Trump continued to maintain that he would veto any bill that did not fund an entire border wall, and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the Senate from considering any appropriations legislation that Trump would not support, including the bill that had previously passed.Democrats and some Republicans opposed the shutdown and passed multiple bills to reopen the government, arguing that the government shutdown amounted to ""hostage-taking"" civil servants and that negotiations could only begin once the government was reopened.\n\nOn January 25, 2019, Trump agreed to endorse a stopgap bill to reopen the government for three weeks up until February 15 to allow for negotiations to take place to approve an appropriations bill that both parties could agree on.However, Trump reiterated his demand for the border wall funding and said that he would shut down the government again or declare a national emergency and use military funding to build the wall if Congress did not appropriate the funds by February 15.\n\nTrump\'s approval rating dropped during the shutdown.A majority of Americans opposed exploitation of the shutdown as a negotiating strategy and held Trump responsible for the shutdown: A CBS News poll found that 71% of Americans considered the border wall ""not worth the shutdown"" and a Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 53% of Americans blamed Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, compared to 34% who blamed Democrats and 10% who blamed both parties.\n\nOn February 15, 2019, Trump declared a national emergency to fund the wall and bypass Congress, after being unsatisfied with a bipartisan border bill that had passed the House and the Senate a day before.\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign, then-candidate Trump promised to build a wall along the Mexico–United States border for which Mexico would pay.The president of Mexico rejected the idea of providing any funding for a U.S. border wall.In 2018, Trump requested $ in federal funding for some of barrier on the border, mostly to replace of aging fence built under the Secure Fence Act of 2006.On December 25, 2018, Trump reversed course, suggesting that he might accept of either mostly refurbished barrier (rather than new barriers in locations that did not previously have them) by November 2020.Trump\'s proposals and public statements on the wall have shifted widely over time, with varied proposals as to the design, material, length, height, and width of a wall.\n\nIn September 2018, Congress passed two ""minibus"" appropriations bills for the 2019 United States federal budget, which began on October 1, 2018.These bills combined five of the 12 regular appropriations bills covering 77% of federal discretionary funding, and included a continuing resolution until December 7 for the remaining agencies.On December 6, Congress passed a second continuing resolution to December 21, to give more time for negotiations on Trump\'s proposed border wall, which had been delayed due to the funeral of George H. W. Bush.\n\nA Senate Homeland Security appropriations bill, negotiated by both parties and reported by the committee to the Senate, provided for $ for border security, including funds for ""approximately 65 miles of pedestrian fencing along the southwest border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector"".The bill did not receive a vote on the Senate floor, although House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer indicated that such a proposal could be acceptable to House Democrats.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said the Democratic Party would not support $ for the border wall.At a press conference before the government shutdown, he noted ""the $1.6 billion for border security negotiated by Democrats and Republicans is our position.We believe that is the right way to go.""\n\nOn December 11, President Trump held a televised meeting with Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in the Oval Office and asked them to support an appropriation of $5.7 billion for funding of a border wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico.They refused, resulting in an argument between Trump and both Congressional leaders.During the contentious discussion, Trump remarked, ""I am proud to shut down the government for border security ...I will be the one to shut [the government] down.I\'m not going to blame you for it ...I will take the mantle.I will be the one to shut it down.""Schumer replied, ""We shouldn\'t shut down the government over a dispute.""Ten days later, Trump blamed Democrats for the impending shutdown.\n\nThree days later, Politico reported that Trump was willing to sign a bill with no funding for a border wall that delayed a government shutdown into 2019 and the new Congress.On December 18, following a meeting with Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the government would not shut down on December 22 and that Trump was ""flexible"" over funding for a border wall.Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby commented that the most likely resolution was a bill that funded the government until early February.Schumer added that his caucus would ""very seriously"" consider such a bill and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said ""I don\'t know anybody on the Hill that wants a shutdown, and I think all the president\'s advisers are telling him this would not be good.""\n\nOn December 19, the Senate passed a second continuing resolution () that would fund the government until February 8, 2019.Pelosi announced that House Democrats would support the measure, meaning it would overcome opposition from conservative Republicans and pass the House.On December 20, following increased criticism from conservative media, pundits, and political figures, Trump reversed his position and declared that he would not sign any funding bill that did not include border wall funding.The same day, the House passed a continuing resolution that included $5 billion for the wall and $8 billion in disaster aid.This bill failed in the Senate.Trump\'s changing position caused consternation among Senate Republicans.\n\nThe shutdown started December 22 and Trump announced that he would cancel his planned trip to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas and stay in Washington, D.C.The meaning of the term ""wall"" was expected to be an aspect of the negotiations.\n\nCongress adjourned on December 22 for the Christmas and holiday season, with many predicting that the shutdown would not be resolved until the start of the 116th Congress.The Senate reconvened on December 27 for four minutes, with Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) presiding over the session.The House briefly reconvened as well, with Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) saying that members should not expect any further votes for the rest of 2018.Representative Jim McGovern (D-MA) went to the House floor to try to force consideration of a short-term funding bill to end the shutdown that the Senate had already passed, but the Republican Speaker-pro-tem refused to let him speak.\n\nCongress then adjourned again until December 31, 2018, for a pro forma session.On January 2, 2019, the last full day of the 115th United States Congress, there was a pro forma session scheduled to last several minutes.\n\nThe new Congress was sworn in on January 3, 2019, and one of the first orders of business in the House after electing the Speaker and swearing in the new members was a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security until February 8 (), which passed by a vote of 239–192; and a package combining five appropriation bills funding the rest of the government for the remainder of the fiscal year (), passed by a vote of 241–190.The bills contained $1.3 billion of funding for border security, but no additional funding for a border wall.\n\nBeginning on January 9, the Democratic-controlled House voted on four appropriations bills individually:\n\nFinancial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Treasury (including the Internal Revenue Service), federal judiciary, District of Columbia, and a number of independent agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, General Services Administration, and Securities and Exchange Commission.The House passed the legislation on January 9, on a 240–188 vote, with every Democrat and eight Republicans voting yes, and all other Republicans voting no. Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Department of Agriculture (including food stamps), the Food and Drug Administration, and related entities.On January 10, the House passed this bill 243–183.Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore Transportation and Housing and Urban Development (including some federal mortgage programs).On January 10, the House passed this bill 244–180.Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Interior Department, Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies, including the Smithsonian Institution.On January 11, ten House Republicans voted with Democrats in a 240–179 vote to end the shutdown of Interior-Environment programs.It was the most recent of a ""series of standalone appropriations measures"" the House sent to the Senate.\n\nThis strategy has been compared to one used by Republicans during the 2013 shutdown in the form of a series of fourteen mini-continuing resolutions.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed that the Senate would not consider the House bills to reopen the government, indicating that Senate Republicans would not support any bill unless it had Trump\'s support.In January 2019, McConnell and Senate Republicans came under increased pressure to break the impasse and reopen the government.Three Republican Senators—Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Cory Gardner of Colorado—called for an end to the shutdown.Senators Collins and Gardner said they supported the House\'s budget bills to end the shutdown.West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito said that she could support ending the shutdown provided border wall talks continued.Pat Roberts of Kansas said that shutdowns ""never work"" and only turned affected federal workers into ""pawns"" and that, although the time had not yet come for Senate Republicans to override any possible Trump veto and end the shutdown, ""we\'re getting pretty close.""Johnny Isakson of Georgia echoed that sentiment, saying that support for McConnell\'s refusal to support bills that do not include funding for a wall would not last indefinitely: ""There\'s a time when that may run out.""\n\nOn January 16, McConnell again blocked the House appropriation bills to reopen the government from being considered on the Senate floor.The following day, McConnell blocked consideration of bills to reopen most of the closed government agencies for a third time.On January 23, McConnell blocked a bill to reopen most of the government for the fourth time.\n\nOn January 22, McConnell stated that the Senate would be voting on two different bills to end the shutdown on January 24.The first vote is on a bill to reopen the government which includes Trump\'s proposal to provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and temporary protections to some immigration classes.The other bill is a three-week continuing resolution to fund 25% of the government through February 8.\n\nOn January 22, Senator Mark Warner introduced a bill to keep the federal government running in the event of future shutdown events.The bill is called the ""Stop Shutdowns Transferring Unnecessary Pain and Inflicting Damage in the Coming Years Act"" or the ""Stop STUPIDITY Act"".\n\nOn January 24, the Senate held two votes on competing Democratic and Republican proposals to end the shutdown.The Democratic proposal was largely similar to the measure that had previously passed the Senate unanimously in the 115th Congress, and then been passed by the Democratic-controlled House in the 116th Congress.It provided funding for the government with no money for the border wall.The Republican proposal incorporated Trump\'s proposal, which would fund a border wall; temporarily extend TPS and DACA for three years, but would substantially narrow eligibility for DACA; and make significant legal changes to make it more difficult for persons escaping violence and persecution to be granted asylum in the United States.Neither proposal was able to attain the 60 votes needed for passage.The Trump plan failed in a 50–47 vote.The Democratic plan failed in a 52–44 vote.Most Republicans voted for Trump\'s plan and against the Democratic plan.Most Democrats voted for the Democratic plan and against Trump\'s plan.Republicans Tom Cotton and Mike Lee voted against both plans.Democrat Joe Manchin and Republicans Lamar Alexander, Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, Johnny Isakson, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney voted for both plans.Not voting on either were Republicans Rand Paul and Jim Risch and Democrat Jacky Rosen.Republican Richard Burr voted for Trump\'s plan and did not vote on the Democratic plan.\n\nOn January 25, House Democrats prepared a compromise proposal to reopen the government, which would provide $5 billion for border security but no wall construction.However, the shutdown ended the same day.\n\nOn January 4, after the new Congress was sworn-in and Pelosi regained the speakership, she and Schumer, as well as congressional Republican leadership met with Trump at the White House.Pelosi and Schumer argued that the shutdown needed to end and reported that Trump refused.They said that Trump threatened to ""keep the government closed for a very long period of time.Months or even years.""Later that day, Trump admitted to ""absolutely"" making that threat, adding, ""I\'m very proud of doing what I\'m doing.""Trump then said that he was considering declaring a national emergency to use military funding for the wall.At the meeting, Trump reprimanded his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney for attempting to propose a compromise between Trump\'s $5.7 billion demand for a border wall and the Democrats\' proposal of $1.3 billion for border security.\n\nTrump addressed the nation from the Oval Office at 9 p.m. EST on January 8, in a nationally televised address broadcast on both network and cable television.In his speech, Trump asserted that there was a ""growing humanitarian and security crisis"" on the Mexico–United States border that could only be solved by appropriating $5.7 billion for construction of a steel wall.Trump did not make any new proposals in his speech to break the impasse.Immediately after Trump\'s speech, Schumer and Pelosi delivered a response on behalf of the Democrats, in which they demanded an end to the shutdown and said: ""President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government.""\n\nTrump met with congressional leadership again on January 9, in a meeting lasting 14 minutes.Trump asked Pelosi, ""Will you agree to my wall?"" and when she replied that she would not, Trump said ""bye-bye"" and walked out of the meeting, later declaring it ""a total waste of time"".Schumer accused Trump of throwing a ""temper tantrum"" and slamming his hands on the table.Trump rebuked Schumer\'s comments on Twitter.Vice President Mike Pence and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that Trump remained calm and never raised his voice.On January 10, Pelosi described the preceding day\'s meeting with Trump as ""a setup"" staged by White House aides so that Trump could walk out of the meeting.Pelosi described Trump as ""un-presidential""; accused him of ""exploiting this situation in a way that enhances his power""; and said: ""I don\'t think he really wants a solution.I think he loves the distraction.""\n\nAfter Trump walked out of the January 9 meeting with congressional Democratic leaders, no further negotiations were conducted.Several Republican senators met in the office of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, after the meeting to discuss a compromise to end the shutdown.They discussed agreeing to Trump\'s demand for border wall funding and offering the Democrats help for Dreamers, refugee protections and extensions to H-2B visas.On January 13, Graham proposed that Trump agree to a congressional vote to reopen the government pending the resumption of negotiations.Graham suggested that if Trump and congressional Democrats did not come to an agreement at that time, Trump could declare a national emergency.Trump rejected this proposal the next day.\n\nOn January 19, Trump proposed a temporary extension of the two programs that protect about 700,000 immigrants from deportation—Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)—in exchange for funding for the border wall.The protections would be temporary, with no path to citizenship.Trump had previously revoked TPS for people from a number of Latin American and African countries, and taken steps to rescind DACA.In his remarks at the White House, Trump referred to a ""barrier"" rather than a ""wall"" and indicated that he aimed to erect ""steel barriers in high priority locations"" rather than ""a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea.""\n\nIn addition to funding a border wall, the 1,300-page Republican bill released after Trump made his proposal would make major changes to U.S. immigration policy (which were not included in Trump\'s public announcement).The legislation would severely restrict the ability of children from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to apply for asylum in the United States.Specifically, participation in the Central American Minors Program would be subject to an annual cap and migrant children would be barred from applying for asylum in person at the border, and only migrant children with a ""qualified"" parent in the U.S. would be eligible to apply.The bill would also create a new, more burdensome application process for TPS holders, and would exclude TPS holders from Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen.The American Immigration Lawyers Association government relations director said that the proposal ""would categorically block tens of thousands of children from ever applying for asylum,"" while a Cato Institute immigration analyst wrote that the proposal would not extend DACA, but rather replace it with ""a totally different program that will exclude untold thousands of Dreamers who would have been eligible under DACA.""\n\nDemocrats rejected Trump\'s proposal.In a speech on the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""The president\'s proposal is one-sided, harshly partisan and was made in bad faith.The asylum changes are a poison pill, if there ever was one.""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said extending the DACA proposal temporarily was ""unacceptable"" and a ""non-starter"" because it did not ""represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people\'s lives.""Analysts pointed out that Trump had previously rejected a deal that would have provided funding for the border wall in exchange for further protection for DACA recipients.Conversely, Republicans reacted positively to Trump\'s proposal, and Mitch McConnell said he would bring it to a vote in the Senate.\n\nDuring the shutdown, on January 8 in a press conference, a reporter asked Trump if he was considering declaring a national emergency, to which Trump replied, ""I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want"" and suggested that he could declare an emergency.After this, Trump repeatedly threatened to declare a national emergency to unilaterally order wall construction without congressional authorization.Some of Trump\'s advisors, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, reportedly attempted to dissuade him from doing so.Administration officials considered diverting hurricane-relief and wildfire-relief funds from a $13.9 billion February 2018 emergency supplemental appropriations bill (for disaster relief in Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California, among other places) in order to fund a wall, and directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to look into this possibility.\n\nAn attempt by Trump to invoke emergency powers would almost certainly have prompted a lengthy legal challenge in court.Democrats responded that Trump lacked the authority to declare a national emergency; Representative Adam Schiff called it a ""non-starter"" and said that ""if Harry Truman couldn\'t nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this President doesn\'t have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion dollar wall on the border.""Democratic Representative Nydia Velázquez said the notion of redirecting disaster-relief funds to a border wall was ""beyond appalling"".Presidents have declared emergencies in the past, but none has ""involved funding a policy goal after failing to win congressional approval"".Yale Law School professor Bruce Ackerman wrote that the declaration of a national emergency to build a wall as Trump suggested would be unconstitutional and illegal.Other scholars, such as Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice, believed that Trump could make a colorable argument that diverting military-construction appropriations for border-wall construction was legal, but that doing so would be an abuse of power.Law professor Ilya Somin stated that in the unlikely case that Trump succeeded in using the emergency powers in this way, it would set a dangerous precedent, which Republicans would come to regret next time the president was a Democrat.\n\nOn January 11, Trump—while maintaining he has the authority to do so anytime—said he was not in any rush to declare a national emergency to secure wall funding, saying he would rather see Congress ""do its job"" and that the Democrats ""should come back and vote.""The next day he again threatened to use emergency powers if Democrats did not ""come to their senses.""\n\nOn January 16, Pelosi sent a letter to Trump that indicated the House would be unavailable for the 2019 State of the Union Address that was scheduled for January 29.Pelosi wrote, ""Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government reopens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has reopened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on Jan. 29.""The delivery of the State of the Union address had been delayed or substantially changed on only two occasions since 1913.In a letter sent to the Speaker the next day, Trump said she would not be allowed to take military transport aircraft on scheduled visits to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan.Trump replied, ""We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the shutdown is over.""Pelosi and a congressional delegation had planned on visiting overseas American military personnel.\n\nOn January 23, Trump sent a letter to Pelosi insisting that there were no security concerns and that he would hold the State of the Union Address as scheduled.Trump wrote, ""Therefore, I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and Congress of the United States of America regarding the State of our Union.""In a letter sent in reply, Pelosi stated that the House would not consider a concurrent resolution to authorize the State of the Union Address in the House Chamber until the shutdown ended, writing, ""Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened.""\n\nTrump later stated he would look for an alternative, but then retracted that statement in a pair of tweets announcing that he would wait until the end of the shutdown to give the address in the House Chamber.\n\nOn January 25, Trump announced his support for a three-week funding measure that would reopen the government until February 15.The deal, which also moved forward with long-term Department of Homeland Security funding, did not include funds for a wall.As expected, the agreement provided federal employees with back pay.Both the Senate and House of Representatives passed the funding measure by voice vote, sending the resolution to the President\'s desk.Trump signed the bill the same day, ending the shutdown.\n\nLater in January, Republican senators voted unanimously against a bill to provide back pay to federal contractors.\n\nWithout legislation enacted by February 15, a new partial shutdown would have begun, three weeks after the last ended.A bipartisan group of senators and representatives reached an agreement ""in principle"" on February 11, but Trump did not say whether he would sign it.Included was $1.375 billion for 55 miles of steel border fencing.On February 13, it was reported that, against the wishes of Democratic leaders and many Republicans, Trump was blocking the provision of back pay to federal contractors who were still out of pocket from the shutdown.Both houses passed the bill February 14 with enough votes to override a veto if that happened.\n\nOn February 15, at the White House Rose Garden, Trump announced that he had signed the spending bill to keep the government open.He also declared a national emergency, hoping to get access to $8 billion to use for border security.\n\nAgencies funded by two ""minibus"" appropriations bills passed in September 2018 were not affected by the shutdown.About 380,000 federal employees were furloughed, and an additional 420,000 employees for the affected agencies were expected to work with their pay delayed until the end of the shutdown, totaling 800,000 workers affected out of 2.1 million civilian non-postal federal employees.As only about a quarter of the government was shut down, many people who are not federal employees did not fully realize the effects of the shutdown.\n\nAccording to and , these were the affected agencies:\n\nDepartment of State Department of the Treasury Department of Justice Most of the Department of the Interior Department of Agriculture Department of Commerce Department of Housing and Urban Development Department of Transportation Department of Homeland Security Some Department of Health and Human Services agencies Food and Drug Administration Indian Health Service Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Superfund Research Program Executive Office of the President Most independent agencies Judicial Branch\n\nUnaffected agencies include, according to and :\n\nDepartment of Defense Department of Labor Most of the Department of Health and Human Services Department of Energy Department of Education Department of Veterans Affairs Some Department of the Interior agencies Bureau of Reclamation Central Utah Project District of Columbia (excluding courts) Legislative Branch Social Security Administration Nuclear Regulatory Commission Appalachian Regional Commission Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board Delta Regional Authority Denali Commission Northern Border Regional Commission Southeast Crescent Regional Commission Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board American Battle Monuments Commission U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Cemeterial Expenses of the Army, including Arlington National Cemetery and Soldiers\' and Airmen\'s Home National Cemetery Armed Forces Retirement Home Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System Fund Intelligence Community Management Account Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled Corporation for National and Community Service Corporation for Public Broadcasting Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission Institute of Museum and Library Services Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission Medicare Payment Advisory Commission National Council on Disability National Labor Relations Board National Mediation Board Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission Railroad Retirement Board\n\nJobs affected included staff throughout the United States, not just DC area employees.FBI agents, federal corrections officers, FDA inspectors, NASA employees, TSA staff, Border Patrol staff and CBP officers, census staff, National Park Service staff, members of the Coast Guard, and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers either worked without pay or were furloughed, with increasing numbers of unpaid essential employees failing to show up for work.\n\nOn January 11, 800,000 workers for agencies shutdown or furloughed missed their first paycheck.Federal workers normally receive pay on federal holidays, which include Christmas, New Year\'s Day and potentially Martin Luther King Jr. Day.The shutdown affected the employees\' entitlement to paid holidays due to the shutdown.Unemployment assistance to federal workers furloughed under the government shutdown varied by locality.Only non-reporting workers were eligible for assistance, whereas furloughed workers who still reported to work were not.Workers who received unemployment assistance were required pay it back after the shut down ended and they received backpay.Some furloughed workers sought other employment opportunities while they were idled.However, external employment must meet agency-specific ethics guidelines, and mandatory reviews of external employment were also curtailed as most ethics officials were also furloughed.Federal employees were not able to use vacation or sick leave during the shutdown so scheduled holiday vacation time either became unpaid if the worker was deemed non-essential or was cancelled if the worker was deemed essential.In many cases unused leave over a certain threshold expired at year-end, but employees who had leave scheduled in advance of the shutdown did not have ""use or lose"" leave balances deducted from their accrued leave.Many furloughed employees took to crowd-funding campaigns to raise cash to replace missed paychecks, but these types of solicitations also run afoul of government ethics rules.\n\nAs furloughed federal workers and their families shared stories of their hardships, such as not being able to meet rent or mortgage payments and missed bills, the hashtag ""#ShutdownStories"" went viral on social media.The federal government\'s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) responded by publishing sample letters that employees could send to their creditors.One read, in part, ""I am a Federal employee who has recently been furloughed due to a lack of funding of my agency.Because of this, my income has been severely cut and I am unable to pay the entire cost of my mortgage, along with my other expenses.""Other federal workers reached out to other news outlets to share stories about having to stretch their budgets and the impact of the shutdown on their families.In addition to being unable to meet rent or pay bills, many federal workers around the country were unable to pay for groceries and turned to food banks.One federal prison guard in Louisiana attempted suicide after posting about the financial pressures of the shutdown on Facebook.\n\nThe OPM also suggested that employees who had landlords write: ""I would like to discuss with you the possibility of trading my services to perform maintenance (e.g. painting, carpentry work) in exchange for partial rent payments"" and suggested those who lacked funds to pay bills should hire personal attorneys to assist them.Other organizations also posted advice on how to ""find supplemental income""; the Coast Guard suggested that Coast Guard members ""have a garage sale, offer to watch children, walk pets or house sit"" while furloughed.\n\nOn January 4, The Washington Post reported that because the shutdown was triggered by the failure to enact spending bills that continued a federal government pay freeze, hundreds of senior Trump administration political appointees would receive a roughly $10,000 pay raise the following day.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the pending pay raise was an ""unnecessary byproduct of the shutdown.""\n\nOn January 10, the Senate approved by unanimous consent a bill (S.24, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019) providing that furloughed federal employees would receive back pay for the period of the furlough once appropriations were restored; the bill was approved the next day by the House on a vote of 411–7.Trump signed the bill into law on January 16.\n\nNative American tribes were not paid for treaties negotiated with the United States government.These treaties specified that the federal government must provide funding for health clinics, employee salaries, education, infrastructure and other services, which were not paid during the shutdown.Native lands are ""owned, managed and maintained by the federal government.""Native Americans who receive a per capita check for profits from oil and gas sales from tribal land did not receive check for the month of February.Roads were not plowed on tribal land, and some areas received significant snowfall.This caused people of the Navajo Nation to become trapped inside their homes.Food services, which fed 90,000 Native Americans in 2017, were halted.\n\nNative American communities had a high percentage of individuals who worked for the federal government and lost income during the shutdown.In North and South Dakota, one of the largest employers is the Indian Health Service.The Chippewa tribe reported an economic loss of nearly $100,000 daily in funds that the federal government was supposed to provide as a treaty obligation.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was closed for the shutdown.However, 60 percent of the Indian Health Service (IHS) continued to work without pay.IHS provides care for 2.2 million Native Americans and on January 23, began to deny care that was not considered ""life threatening.""The Bureau of Indian Education was able to stay open because it was funded on a different schedule.Unlike other government shutdowns, there was little outreach from the Trump Administration to Native Americans and the Chippewa tribe in Michigan was given a 24-hour notice that the shutdown would take place and affect the tribe.\n\nThe only military branch that was affected by the shutdown was the Coast Guard because it was part of the Department of Homeland Security, while the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps were all funded through the Department of Defense.Officials were able to fund payment on December 31, 2018, but were not able to do so for the paychecks of January 15 and 30, 2019, along with the pay and benefits for civilian workers and retirees.During the shutdown, the Coast Guard continued to engage in patrolling the American coastline and carrying out overseas missions in locations such as the Persian Gulf along with the Navy and in the Caribbean.Other issues arose in the payment processes for Coast Guard members Tricare Health and Dental Program payments, although the individuals were still covered.\n\nMilitary schools, such as the Coast Guard Academy and the National War College, lost funding due to the shutdown and the schools had to work to find funds to pay professors.\n\nAlthough the Department of Defense was not shut down, the February 4, 2019, date for release of the Pentagon\'s 2020 budget was delayed by at least one month.This had repercussions on the interim period which is usually used by Pentagon planners for adjustments before the 2020 fiscal year which will begin in October 2019.The White House Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the Pentagon request, was shut down when the Pentagon budget arrived in December, and remained inactive, so no work was done on the budget.\n\nOn February 25, 2019, the Pentagon\'s counter-drug (interdiction) funding has up to $85 million not yet obligated, but that money was planned for the known corridors in El Paso, Tucson, Yuma, and El Centro for border fencing, lighting, and road projects, so any funds which might possibly be intended for additional projects elsewhere along the border must be obligated by September 30, 2019, in order not to affect the known corridors.Otherwise appropriations above the $85 million not yet obligated for additional interdiction border projects will have to be approved by additional Congressional appropriations, to reach the $2 billion target.\n\nA January 28, 2019 Congressional Budget Office report estimated that the 35-day partial government shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion, including $3 billion in permanent losses; the CBO estimate excluded indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.The furloughing of 145,000 federal workers and 112,500 federal contractors in the Washington Metropolitan Area cost the regional economy $119 million each day, or 7.3% of the region\'s total output.That reduced GDP by over $2.8 billion in the Washington DC area alone.The shutdown also had a noticeable impact on hunger in the national capital region: food pantries in Washington DC and Northern Virginia reported an increase of around 10% in the number of people coming to pick up groceries, with most of that increase coming from federal workers and contractors.\n\nFitch Ratings warned that an extended shutdown might lead to a downgrade in the U.S.\'s Triple-A credit rating if lawmakers were unable to pass a budget or manage the debt ceiling.That in turn would make borrowing more costly for companies and American households, because it is the benchmark for many other lines of credit.The only time the U.S. credit rating has been downgraded by S&P was during the United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011.\n\nSome economists believed that an extended shutdown would weaken consumer confidence and heighten the risk of pushing the U.S. economy into a recession.Between 800,000 federal government employees and some 4 million federal contractors, the shutdown directly affected nearly 3% of the labor force of the United States; in a typical recession, unemployment increases 2–4%.The reduction in spending by those households combined with the reduction of government services could have macroeconomic results similar to a typical recession.The shutdown had an adverse effect on the budgets of state and local governments, as states covered some federal services (particularly the most vulnerable) during the shutdown.\n\nBy mid-January 2019, the White House Council of Economic Advisors estimated that each week of the shutdown reduced GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, the equivalent of 1.2 points per quarter.CEA chairman Kevin Hassett later acknowledged that GDP growth could decline to zero in the first quarter of 2019 if the shutdown lasted the entire quarter.\n\nAs tax season began in the United States on January 28, some 46,000 Internal Revenue Service workers were called back to work to ensure tax refunds and returns were not affected by the shutdown.The recalled workers allowed the department to continue operations that were automatic and those deemed necessary for the safety of human life or protection of government property, such as processing electronic returns, returns with payments, mailing tax forms, appeals, criminal law enforcement investigations and technical support.\n\nDuring the shutdown, 95% of federal staff for the USDA\'s Food and Nutrition Services were furloughed.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the food-stamp program, could be funded through a $3 billion contingency fund appropriated by Congress in 2018; if the shutdown had continued through March 2019, those funds would have been exhausted, leaving some 38 million Americans without food stamps and endangering food security.Concerns were raised that continuation of the shutdown could delay the issuance of some $140 billion in tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees most of the food supply in the U.S.In early January, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner, reported that the FDA suspended food inspections.He noted that inspection of foreign food was continuing as ""almost normal,"" because they are considered vital.Around January 14, ""high-risk"" food inspections resumed.As of January 22, 2019, 46 percent of the FDA were working, though 20 percent of them were working without pay.During the shutdown, two new recalls for contamination with Listeria or Salmonella took place.Consumer advocacy groups advised of food safety issues during the shutdown.Food safety attorney, Bill Marler, advocated against eating ""fresh, uncooked products on the market place.""Because there was a shortage of FDA inspectors, many imported perishable items, such as produce or flowers, were at risk of spoilage.Meat and some egg products are inspected by the USDA\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service.Federal legislation required those inspectors to remain working without pay.\n\nSchool administrations raised concern about how to feed children who purchase food at the schools for lunch, as funding concerns caused some districts to conserve food and funding.Many limited the amount or variation of foods available for the children to purchase, and alerted parents to the concerns and the limited availability of some of the items.Most schools affected were in high-poverty areas, and depended on federally funded lunch programs, such as the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) a federal grant established by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 and operated through the Department of Agriculture.Some 22 million students in nearly 100,000 schools received school meals through that operation.\n\nAs with the January 2018 shutdown, national parks were expected to be open to the extent practical, though there would be no staff and buildings would be closed.The shutdown affected national parks unevenly, some were accessible with bare-bones staffing levels, some operated with money from states or charitable groups, and others were locked off.Diane Regas, president and chief executive of the Trust for Public Land, called upon Trump to close all national parks to protect the public: by the third week of the shutdown, three people had died in national parks.This number was reported as being within \'usual\' levels.At Yosemite National Park, on January 4, 2019, a death from a fall went unreported for a week.\n\nBy January 1, 2019, the problems of neglected trash pileup, overflowing public toilets, and access to first aid were repeated across the Park system.Health and safety concerns were raised, with concerns by scientists that the expansive amount of garbage and human waste could impact water and soil quality, or cause damage to animals in the parks.Other issues that arose due to the shutdown included illegal campsites, protected agriculture being damaged, damaging of government property and trespassing on foot and by vehicle.\n\nNew York kept the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open, as it did during the January 2018 shutdown.Arizona and Utah were able to keep Grand Canyon National Park, Zion National Park, Arches National Park, and Bryce Canyon National Park open and provided services including public restrooms, shuttles and trash collection.Utah\'s funding included visitor centers.The sites closed outright in the southwest alone included Bandelier National Monument and Valles Caldera National Preserve in northern New Mexico, White Sands National Monument in southern New Mexico, Petrified Forest National Park in northern Arizona and Casa Grande Ruins National Monument in south-central Arizona.Access to major parts of Sequoia and Kings Canyon parks were closed, and at Joshua Tree National Park, the administration policy of leaving parks open to visitors despite the staff furloughs resulted in park damage, including the toppling of protected trees.In Texas, Big Bend National Park had no visitor services, such as restrooms.Some trailheads were closed.Regulations continued to be enforced, as the park remained open.Visitors were reminded to remove their own trash and toilet paper.The Alamo remained open but no NPS services were available at the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park.Channel Islands National Park remained open to public access, although services normally provided by the national park service were instead provided by Island Packers Cruises, the company normally in charge of ferries to the islands.\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration closed immediately on December 22, 2018.The Library of Congress, the U.S. Botanic Garden, the Capitol Visitor Center, and the U.S. Capitol Building remained open as they were funded by the 2019 Legislative Branch appropriations bill.The Smithsonian Institution operated on ""prior-year funds"" through January 1, 2019.On January 2, 2019, the Smithsonian Institution initiated an orderly shutdown of all its facilities, including 19 museums in Washington, D.C., and New York City, the National Zoo, and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.The following day, the National Gallery of Art was closed.The National Zoo also closed on January 3, 2019.Tourism attendance on the National Mall was affected.On January 5, 2019, acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt directed the diversion of fee revenue defined by the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to be used to fund minimal maintenance activities so as to preserve access to highly visited parks.\n\nAccording to a January 12, 2019, article in The Economist, on January 11, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was unable to pay its workers who had not been paid since December 22; 55% more of them called in sick than in January 2018.\n\nAs the air traffic controllers were deemed essential employees, they were required to work without pay.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents air traffic controllers, filed a lawsuit against the federal government for the shutdown on January 11, 2019, claiming that requiring 16,000 air traffic controllers to work without being paid violated their constitutional rights and federal minimum wage law.That was the third lawsuit filed against the federal government since the beginning of the shutdown.\n\nAirline and aircraft safety inspectors, on the other hand, were deemed nonessential and furloughed.A news report on January 12, 2019, stated that the Federal Aviation Administration had returned 500 furloughed safety inspectors back to work and would return more to work in the following weeks.As the airline and aircraft safety inspectors were furloughed, the certification process of the Airbus A220 in the US was stalled.Delta Air Lines was forced to delay the launch of the new aircraft, and to use other models of aircraft to serve those routes that was supposed to be served with A220.Many TSA employees also called out sick, most of them because they were trying to find other jobs that would provide immediate paychecks.\n\nThe shutdown initially prevented the National Transportation Safety Board from assisting the Mexican government\'s investigation of the 2018 Puebla helicopter crash that killed a state governor and senator; an exception allowed the NTSB to assist with the Mexican government in the investigation along with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.The NTSB also had to delay several investigations until the government reopened and only continued investigations into accidents that were considered the most serious.Issues in receiving certification and oversight from the FAA led to a month-long delay in the commencement of passenger service at Paine Field in Everett, Washington.\n\nAs the shutdown continued into its fourth week, the unions representing airline pilots, flight attendants and air traffic controllers issued a statement asserting, ""we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play"" because of the shutdown.\n\nSome airports such as the Philadelphia International Airport, launched food and item donations for federal employees who were affected by the shutdown.Other airports such as the Miami International Airport, and the George Bush International Airport, closed down terminals in order to spread out the TSA workers that were available.\n\nOn January 25, flights destined for LaGuardia Airport in New York were halted to a groundstop by FAA officials due to staffing shortages directly as a result of the shutdown.As a result, several flights to and from neighboring airports in the Northeast, specifically Philadelphia and Newark, suffered significant delays of their own.Soon after that, appropriations passed and the government reopened.\n\nThe shutdown delayed software updates to the Boeing 737 MAX airplane which may have caused the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.\n\nDuring the shutdown, court-appointed private lawyers who represent indigent defendants worked without pay.The Federal Judiciary initially had a goal of sustaining paid operations through January 18, 2019.It said it would run out of money to sustain court operations no earlier than January 25, but perhaps as late as February 1.Failing funding, the Judiciary would operate under the terms of the Antideficiency Act.This Act does not allow federal agencies to expend federal funds before an appropriation, nor to accept any voluntary services.The judiciary had 33,000 employees nationwide.Under the Constitution, Supreme Court Justices, appeals court judges and district judges would continue to be paid.\n\nThe shutdown caused many delays and disruptions in cases.Budgets were watched carefully to be able to pay public defenders, DNA testing, informants, and travel costs to interview victims and witnesses.Staffing issues also brought about concerns and constraints with prisons lacking the staff to safely hold attorney-client visits, and caused a delay in bail hearings.\n\nAgents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed in a report released on January 22, 2019, by the FBI Agents Association, that several different investigations were compromised by the shutdown.The report was called ""Voices from the Field"" and was 72 pages long.FBI agents were unable to pay Confidential Human Sources which risks losing that informant permanently.Some FBI divisions no longer have Spanish-speaking staff on hand and could not work with informants who only speak Spanish.Some agents reported that they did not have the funds to assist in joint operations with local law enforcement.\n\nFederal law enforcement agencies working on Native American land worked without pay through the shutdown.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was forced to cancel a trip to the United States/Mexico border in early January due to the shutdown.DHS was also unable to inspect Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities during the shutdown to ensure that immigrants were being held in facilities appropriately.During the shutdown, the federal government\'s e-Verify system—a system for employers to check the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States—was halted.\n\nDuring the shutdown, a wave of Domain Name System (DNS) attacks on government sites was detected by Homeland Security.The attacks were serious because these Internet sites could be hijacked.\n\nOfficial websites for agencies were rendered insecure or inaccessible through the shutdown, as the expired digital certificates were not renewed.On January 23, DHS asked all government agencies to secure their DNS records; however, many agencies were not able to respond quickly to this request.\n\nExecutive and legislative affairs of the local government of the District of Columbia continued operating through the shutdown, due to a provision previously enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017.The District\'s local court system, including the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, are part of the federal judiciary.Thus, they were partially shut down, preventing District residents from accessing services such as marriage licensing.The District of Columbia government said it would take over trash collection and snow plowing operations for National Park Service facilities in Washington.\n\nThe shutdown also interfered with the response to the 2018 Sunda Strait tsunami, as the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta\'s Twitter account was unable to tweet updates, and the United States Geological Survey was unable to provide data on the tsunami.The American weather model, the GFS, suffered a significant drop in forecast quality when a data format change during the shutdown prevented certain weather data from being recognized by the GFS, and the shutdown prevented the bug from being corrected.\n\nBy mid-day Thursday, January 3, 2019, the FCC had suspended operations.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai canceled his trip to the Consumer Electronics Show.The FTC also suspended certain online operations.The EPA and Department of Energy\'s Energy Star website was not available for the duration of the shutdown.\n\nMakers of alcoholic beverages were unable to receive approval from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau for new labels and recipes during the shutdown.\n\nBased on the recalculation of their operating reserves, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) would have had to cease patent operations in the second week of February.A cadre of personnel was allocated to continue receiving patent applications, receive payments, and maintain the IT infrastructure.Even though the USPTO is self-funded, a Congressional appropriation is required to permit the USPTO to spend money.The pipeline of patent applications at the time took 15.8 months for a response from an examiner.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution shortened to two days and downscaled its scheduled ten-day 2019 Folklife Festival on the National Mall because of the shutdown\'s effects.Sabrina Motley, the director of the festival, said that initially, crucial funding for the June—July event arrived later than expected, slowing preparations.Motley stated: ""The government opened back up, but it took a while for systems to come back online. ...We looked at our production schedule, and it became clear we would need more time than we had.""\n\nThe White House residence staff who stage public receptions were among those furloughed, with a minimal staff continuing to work unpaid for the first family.In the midst of the shutdown Trump invited the Clemson Tigers football team to a White House dinner reception on January 14 in recognition of their College Football Playoff National Championship win.On the morning of the reception Trump announced that he intended to serve fast food hamburgers and pizza to the team, a remark that some commentators interpreted as a joke.That evening Trump welcomed the team in the State Dining Room with a buffet of fast food and pizza from McDonald\'s, Wendy\'s and other restaurant chains, which he stated that he had paid for personally.Trump served fast food to other visiting athletes later that year, after the shutdown had ended.\n\nOn January 10, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with several other unions, announced plans to protest the government shutdown at 1:00pm EST in Washington, DC.Leaders of the National Federation of Federal Employees stated they had hoped that bringing federal workers to the President\'s doorstep would show him that it was the individual workers that the shutdown was hurting the most.President Trump had left to visit the US–Mexican border in Texas earlier in the day.\n\nSimilar protests took place in Philadelphia and St. Louis, among other cities.On January 15, representatives for Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, and Vietnam Veterans of America along with others called for an end to shutdown, but avoided placing any blame on political parties.\n\nShortly after the protests, the American Federation of Government Employees sued the Trump administration to challenge the arrangements for work without pay during the shutdown.A similar suit was raised and won during the 2013 Federal Government shutdown.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association also sued the Trump administration, as the shutdown allegedly violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by failing to pay the workers at least a minimum wage during the shutdown.\n\nAs the salaries for members of Congress are written into permanent law and not funded through annual appropriations, the government shutdown did not affect their salaries.Senators and Representatives were still paid their biweekly salaries of $6,700 towards at least $174,000 a year.\n\nSeveral Democratic and Republican Senators and Representatives said they would donate or refuse their salary during the shutdown.Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw stated that he would refuse his salary, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto indicated she would donate hers to a Nevada charity, Senator Mazie Hirono said she would donate her salary to Hawaii food banks, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would give hers to refugee non-profit HIAS, New York Congressman Max Rose stated that he would give his salary to charity and outgoing Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota pledged hers to charity, along with her Republican colleague John Hoeven.Republican senator Kevin Cramer, who defeated Heidi Heitkamp in the 2018 midterm elections, refused to donate his salary, calling the move ""gimmicky"".Representative Brian Fitzpatrick urged all members of Congress to decline their paychecks.He said, ""If you\'re in Congress, don\'t just delay your pay -- forfeit it, write a check back to the US Treasury.Then you\'ll feel the pain of federal workers.""\n\nBy January 17, 2019, 102 members of Congress—20 Senators and 82 Representatives— chose to decline their paychecks or were donating their paychecks to charity.\n\nDuring the shutdown, many federal workers used food banks and food pantries in order to feed themselves and their families.Many food pantries waived certain restrictions in order to help government workers have access to food.During the shutdown, the Salvation Army Emergency Disasters Services program provided meals for federal workers.Chef Jose Andres created the #ChefsForFeds program to feed federal workers in Washington, D.C. and by January 21, made announcements to expand the program nationwide.\n\nSome states such as California, offered furloughed employees unemployment benefits, although the Trump administration allegedly told states that they could not do so with federal funds.Organizations such as state Attorney Generals offices, and credit card companies posted statements to their websites to offer a means to help to consolidate debt, meet mortgages or other payments such as child support or tuition.An employment law firm offered pro bono legal advice to furloughed federal employees.School districts opened up free or reduced lunch options for children of federal employees, and looked into other options to aid parents amid concerns that financial stress at home would adversely affect families and children.Every mainline denomination in America has contributed to efforts to provide relief.One Baptist church emptied its entire disaster fund to aid federal employees.\n\nOn January 24, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross downplayed the financial difficulties faced by the 800,000 federal workers affected by the shutdown, stating that they should borrow money to ""tide them over"" until the shutdown ends.Critics and Democrats criticized the statement as inappropriate, noting that Ross\' own net worth is estimated at almost $700 million, accusing him of being out of touch with the workers.Ross also said that he ""did not understand"" why people who were not getting paid due to the shutdown were visiting food banks.When asked about Ross\' statement, Trump suggested that grocery stores will ""work along"" with the government by voluntarily extending credit to those who are out of funds to buy food.National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow characterized the shutdown as a ""glitch"" and suggested that federal workers who were required to work without pay were ""volunteering"" to work for their love of the country and ""presumably their allegiance to President Trump.""\n\nIn a video message to staff, FBI director Christopher Wray stated, ""Making some people stay home when they don\'t want to, and making others show up without pay, it\'s mind-boggling, it\'s shortsighted and it\'s unfair.It takes a lot to get me angry, but I\'m about as angry as I\'ve been in a long, long time.""\n\nLara Trump, a daughter-in-law of the President, drew outrage after an interview in which she stated that while ""It\'s not fair to you..."" the shutdown was ""...a little bit of pain, but it\'s going to be for the future of our country, and their children and their grandchildren and generations after them will thank them for their sacrifice right now.""Her comments drew criticism by politicians, celebrities, and the general public who felt the advisor and spokeswoman for the Trump 2020 campaign was out of touch, however Lara Trump later claimed the comments were taken out of context.\n\nIn January 2019, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that 56% of the responding public opposed a wall while 39% favored it, and 45% viewed the situation at the border as a crisis.The numbers were similar to the poll in December 2018 yet a later poll by ABC News showed that as the partial shutdown entered its fourth week support for building a wall was increasing.A poll done through YouGov between December 23–25, 2018, reported that 51% of respondents thought Trump deserved ""a lot"" of the blame, 44% thought congressional Democrats and 39% thought congressional Republicans.Similar results were reported by a December 21–25 survey done by Reuters and Ipsos in which 47% of respondents said that the shutdown was the President\'s fault and 33% blamed Congressional Democrats.\n\nOver the course of the shutdown, Trump\'s approval rating marginally declined while his disapproval rating marginally increased.His net approval rating was by the middle of January 2019 at its lowest point since February 2018.On December 27, 2018, it was reported that Trump\'s approval rating of registered voters was at 39%, with 56% disapproval.Broken down the rating was split across party lines, with Republicans reporting an 80% approval rate while Democrats and independents reported a 90% and 57% disapproval rating, respectively.The poll was conducted through Morning Consult between December 21–23.The poll also reported that 43% of respondents blamed Trump for the shutdown, with 31% blaming congressional Democrats and 7% congressional Republicans.Another poll through The New York Times Upshot/Siena College reported that 89% of voters\' views on Trump and the wall were aligned, suggesting that support for the wall was a function of support for Trump.\n\nThe Washington Post–ABC News poll published on January 13, 2019, found that a larger number of Americans blamed Trump and congressional Republicans than congressional Democrats for the shutdown.A PBS NewsHour–Marist poll found that on January 15, 2019, a majority of Americans thought that President Trump was to blame for the shutdown.A January 2019 poll conducted by telephone for CBS News found that 70% of Americans polled did not want a government shutdown over the issue of building a border wall; 66% believed that Trump should agree to a budget without wall funding.\n\nPresidency of Donald Trump Donald Trump January 2018 United

52,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018–2019 United States federal government shutdown', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The United States federal government shutdown from midnight EST on December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019 (35 days) was the longest government shutdown in history and the second and final federal government shutdown involving furloughs during the presidency of Donald Trump.It occurred when the 115th Congress and Trump could not agree on an appropriations bill to fund the operations of the federal government for the 2019 fiscal year, or a temporary continuing resolution that would extend the deadline for passing a bill.The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal departments or agencies from conducting non-essential operations without appropriations legislation in place.As a result, nine executive departments with around 800,000 employees had to shut down partially or in full, affecting about one-fourth of government activities and causing employees to be furloughed or required to work without being paid.The Congressional Budget Office estimated the shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion USD, excluding indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.\n\nThe shutdown stemmed from an impasse over Trump\'s demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall.In December 2018, the Senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the bill appeared likely to be approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Trump.After Trump faced heavy criticism from some right-wing media outlets and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to ""build the wall"", he announced that he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund its construction.As a result, the House passed a stopgap bill with funding for the wall, but it was blocked in the Senate by the threat of a Democratic filibuster.\n\nIn January 2019, representatives elected in the November 2018 election took office, giving the Democrats a majority in the House.The House immediately voted to approve the appropriations bill that had previously passed the Senate unanimously (which included no funding for the wall).For several weeks, Trump continued to maintain that he would veto any bill that did not fund an entire border wall, and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the Senate from considering any appropriations legislation that Trump would not support, including the bill that had previously passed.Democrats and some Republicans opposed the shutdown and passed multiple bills to reopen the government, arguing that the government shutdown amounted to ""hostage-taking"" civil servants and that negotiations could only begin once the government was reopened.\n\nOn January 25, 2019, Trump agreed to endorse a stopgap bill to reopen the government for three weeks up until February 15 to allow for negotiations to take place to approve an appropriations bill that both parties could agree on.However, Trump reiterated his demand for the border wall funding and said that he would shut down the government again or declare a national emergency and use military funding to build the wall if Congress did not appropriate the funds by February 15.\n\nTrump\'s approval rating dropped during the shutdown.A majority of Americans opposed exploitation of the shutdown as a negotiating strategy and held Trump responsible for the shutdown: A CBS News poll found that 71% of Americans considered the border wall ""not worth the shutdown"" and a Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 53% of Americans blamed Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, compared to 34% who blamed Democrats and 10% who blamed both parties.\n\nOn February 15, 2019, Trump declared a national emergency to fund the wall and bypass Congress, after being unsatisfied with a bipartisan border bill that had passed the House and the Senate a day before.\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign, then-candidate Trump promised to build a wall along the Mexico–United States border for which Mexico would pay.The president of Mexico rejected the idea of providing any funding for a U.S. border wall.In 2018, Trump requested $ in federal funding for some of barrier on the border, mostly to replace of aging fence built under the Secure Fence Act of 2006.On December 25, 2018, Trump reversed course, suggesting that he might accept of either mostly refurbished barrier (rather than new barriers in locations that did not previously have them) by November 2020.Trump\'s proposals and public statements on the wall have shifted widely over time, with varied proposals as to the design, material, length, height, and width of a wall.\n\nIn September 2018, Congress passed two ""minibus"" appropriations bills for the 2019 United States federal budget, which began on October 1, 2018.These bills combined five of the 12 regular appropriations bills covering 77% of federal discretionary funding, and included a continuing resolution until December 7 for the remaining agencies.On December 6, Congress passed a second continuing resolution to December 21, to give more time for negotiations on Trump\'s proposed border wall, which had been delayed due to the funeral of George H. W. Bush.\n\nA Senate Homeland Security appropriations bill, negotiated by both parties and reported by the committee to the Senate, provided for $ for border security, including funds for ""approximately 65 miles of pedestrian fencing along the southwest border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector"".The bill did not receive a vote on the Senate floor, although House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer indicated that such a proposal could be acceptable to House Democrats.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said the Democratic Party would not support $ for the border wall.At a press conference before the government shutdown, he noted ""the $1.6 billion for border security negotiated by Democrats and Republicans is our position.We believe that is the right way to go.""\n\nOn December 11, President Trump held a televised meeting with Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in the Oval Office and asked them to support an appropriation of $5.7 billion for funding of a border wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico.They refused, resulting in an argument between Trump and both Congressional leaders.During the contentious discussion, Trump remarked, ""I am proud to shut down the government for border security ...I will be the one to shut [the government] down.I\'m not going to blame you for it ...I will take the mantle.I will be the one to shut it down.""Schumer replied, ""We shouldn\'t shut down the government over a dispute.""Ten days later, Trump blamed Democrats for the impending shutdown.\n\nThree days later, Politico reported that Trump was willing to sign a bill with no funding for a border wall that delayed a government shutdown into 2019 and the new Congress.On December 18, following a meeting with Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the government would not shut down on December 22 and that Trump was ""flexible"" over funding for a border wall.Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby commented that the most likely resolution was a bill that funded the government until early February.Schumer added that his caucus would ""very seriously"" consider such a bill and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said ""I don\'t know anybody on the Hill that wants a shutdown, and I think all the president\'s advisers are telling him this would not be good.""\n\nOn December 19, the Senate passed a second continuing resolution () that would fund the government until February 8, 2019.Pelosi announced that House Democrats would support the measure, meaning it would overcome opposition from conservative Republicans and pass the House.On December 20, following increased criticism from conservative media, pundits, and political figures, Trump reversed his position and declared that he would not sign any funding bill that did not include border wall funding.The same day, the House passed a continuing resolution that included $5 billion for the wall and $8 billion in disaster aid.This bill failed in the Senate.Trump\'s changing position caused consternation among Senate Republicans.\n\nThe shutdown started December 22 and Trump announced that he would cancel his planned trip to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas and stay in Washington, D.C.The meaning of the term ""wall"" was expected to be an aspect of the negotiations.\n\nCongress adjourned on December 22 for the Christmas and holiday season, with many predicting that the shutdown would not be resolved until the start of the 116th Congress.The Senate reconvened on December 27 for four minutes, with Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) presiding over the session.The House briefly reconvened as well, with Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) saying that members should not expect any further votes for the rest of 2018.Representative Jim McGovern (D-MA) went to the House floor to try to force consideration of a short-term funding bill to end the shutdown that the Senate had already passed, but the Republican Speaker-pro-tem refused to let him speak.\n\nCongress then adjourned again until December 31, 2018, for a pro forma session.On January 2, 2019, the last full day of the 115th United States Congress, there was a pro forma session scheduled to last several minutes.\n\nThe new Congress was sworn in on January 3, 2019, and one of the first orders of business in the House after electing the Speaker and swearing in the new members was a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security until February 8 (), which passed by a vote of 239–192; and a package combining five appropriation bills funding the rest of the government for the remainder of the fiscal year (), passed by a vote of 241–190.The bills contained $1.3 billion of funding for border security, but no additional funding for a border wall.\n\nBeginning on January 9, the Democratic-controlled House voted on four appropriations bills individually:\n\nFinancial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Treasury (including the Internal Revenue Service), federal judiciary, District of Columbia, and a number of independent agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, General Services Administration, and Securities and Exchange Commission.The House passed the legislation on January 9, on a 240–188 vote, with every Democrat and eight Republicans voting yes, and all other Republicans voting no. Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Department of Agriculture (including food stamps), the Food and Drug Administration, and related entities.On January 10, the House passed this bill 243–183.Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore Transportation and Housing and Urban Development (including some federal mortgage programs).On January 10, the House passed this bill 244–180.Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Interior Department, Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies, including the Smithsonian Institution.On January 11, ten House Republicans voted with Democrats in a 240–179 vote to end the shutdown of Interior-Environment programs.It was the most recent of a ""series of standalone appropriations measures"" the House sent to the Senate.\n\nThis strategy has been compared to one used by Republicans during the 2013 shutdown in the form of a series of fourteen mini-continuing resolutions.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed that the Senate would not consider the House bills to reopen the government, indicating that Senate Republicans would not support any bill unless it had Trump\'s support.In January 2019, McConnell and Senate Republicans came under increased pressure to break the impasse and reopen the government.Three Republican Senators—Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Cory Gardner of Colorado—called for an end to the shutdown.Senators Collins and Gardner said they supported the House\'s budget bills to end the shutdown.West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito said that she could support ending the shutdown provided border wall talks continued.Pat Roberts of Kansas said that shutdowns ""never work"" and only turned affected federal workers into ""pawns"" and that, although the time had not yet come for Senate Republicans to override any possible Trump veto and end the shutdown, ""we\'re getting pretty close.""Johnny Isakson of Georgia echoed that sentiment, saying that support for McConnell\'s refusal to support bills that do not include funding for a wall would not last indefinitely: ""There\'s a time when that may run out.""\n\nOn January 16, McConnell again blocked the House appropriation bills to reopen the government from being considered on the Senate floor.The following day, McConnell blocked consideration of bills to reopen most of the closed government agencies for a third time.On January 23, McConnell blocked a bill to reopen most of the government for the fourth time.\n\nOn January 22, McConnell stated that the Senate would be voting on two different bills to end the shutdown on January 24.The first vote is on a bill to reopen the government which includes Trump\'s proposal to provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and temporary protections to some immigration classes.The other bill is a three-week continuing resolution to fund 25% of the government through February 8.\n\nOn January 22, Senator Mark Warner introduced a bill to keep the federal government running in the event of future shutdown events.The bill is called the ""Stop Shutdowns Transferring Unnecessary Pain and Inflicting Damage in the Coming Years Act"" or the ""Stop STUPIDITY Act"".\n\nOn January 24, the Senate held two votes on competing Democratic and Republican proposals to end the shutdown.The Democratic proposal was largely similar to the measure that had previously passed the Senate unanimously in the 115th Congress, and then been passed by the Democratic-controlled House in the 116th Congress.It provided funding for the government with no money for the border wall.The Republican proposal incorporated Trump\'s proposal, which would fund a border wall; temporarily extend TPS and DACA for three years, but would substantially narrow eligibility for DACA; and make significant legal changes to make it more difficult for persons escaping violence and persecution to be granted asylum in the United States.Neither proposal was able to attain the 60 votes needed for passage.The Trump plan failed in a 50–47 vote.The Democratic plan failed in a 52–44 vote.Most Republicans voted for Trump\'s plan and against the Democratic plan.Most Democrats voted for the Democratic plan and against Trump\'s plan.Republicans Tom Cotton and Mike Lee voted against both plans.Democrat Joe Manchin and Republicans Lamar Alexander, Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, Johnny Isakson, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney voted for both plans.Not voting on either were Republicans Rand Paul and Jim Risch and Democrat Jacky Rosen.Republican Richard Burr voted for Trump\'s plan and did not vote on the Democratic plan.\n\nOn January 25, House Democrats prepared a compromise proposal to reopen the government, which would provide $5 billion for border security but no wall construction.However, the shutdown ended the same day.\n\nOn January 4, after the new Congress was sworn-in and Pelosi regained the speakership, she and Schumer, as well as congressional Republican leadership met with Trump at the White House.Pelosi and Schumer argued that the shutdown needed to end and reported that Trump refused.They said that Trump threatened to ""keep the government closed for a very long period of time.Months or even years.""Later that day, Trump admitted to ""absolutely"" making that threat, adding, ""I\'m very proud of doing what I\'m doing.""Trump then said that he was considering declaring a national emergency to use military funding for the wall.At the meeting, Trump reprimanded his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney for attempting to propose a compromise between Trump\'s $5.7 billion demand for a border wall and the Democrats\' proposal of $1.3 billion for border security.\n\nTrump addressed the nation from the Oval Office at 9 p.m. EST on January 8, in a nationally televised address broadcast on both network and cable television.In his speech, Trump asserted that there was a ""growing humanitarian and security crisis"" on the Mexico–United States border that could only be solved by appropriating $5.7 billion for construction of a steel wall.Trump did not make any new proposals in his speech to break the impasse.Immediately after Trump\'s speech, Schumer and Pelosi delivered a response on behalf of the Democrats, in which they demanded an end to the shutdown and said: ""President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government.""\n\nTrump met with congressional leadership again on January 9, in a meeting lasting 14 minutes.Trump asked Pelosi, ""Will you agree to my wall?"" and when she replied that she would not, Trump said ""bye-bye"" and walked out of the meeting, later declaring it ""a total waste of time"".Schumer accused Trump of throwing a ""temper tantrum"" and slamming his hands on the table.Trump rebuked Schumer\'s comments on Twitter.Vice President Mike Pence and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that Trump remained calm and never raised his voice.On January 10, Pelosi described the preceding day\'s meeting with Trump as ""a setup"" staged by White House aides so that Trump could walk out of the meeting.Pelosi described Trump as ""un-presidential""; accused him of ""exploiting this situation in a way that enhances his power""; and said: ""I don\'t think he really wants a solution.I think he loves the distraction.""\n\nAfter Trump walked out of the January 9 meeting with congressional Democratic leaders, no further negotiations were conducted.Several Republican senators met in the office of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, after the meeting to discuss a compromise to end the shutdown.They discussed agreeing to Trump\'s demand for border wall funding and offering the Democrats help for Dreamers, refugee protections and extensions to H-2B visas.On January 13, Graham proposed that Trump agree to a congressional vote to reopen the government pending the resumption of negotiations.Graham suggested that if Trump and congressional Democrats did not come to an agreement at that time, Trump could declare a national emergency.Trump rejected this proposal the next day.\n\nOn January 19, Trump proposed a temporary extension of the two programs that protect about 700,000 immigrants from deportation—Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)—in exchange for funding for the border wall.The protections would be temporary, with no path to citizenship.Trump had previously revoked TPS for people from a number of Latin American and African countries, and taken steps to rescind DACA.In his remarks at the White House, Trump referred to a ""barrier"" rather than a ""wall"" and indicated that he aimed to erect ""steel barriers in high priority locations"" rather than ""a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea.""\n\nIn addition to funding a border wall, the 1,300-page Republican bill released after Trump made his proposal would make major changes to U.S. immigration policy (which were not included in Trump\'s public announcement).The legislation would severely restrict the ability of children from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to apply for asylum in the United States.Specifically, participation in the Central American Minors Program would be subject to an annual cap and migrant children would be barred from applying for asylum in person at the border, and only migrant children with a ""qualified"" parent in the U.S. would be eligible to apply.The bill would also create a new, more burdensome application process for TPS holders, and would exclude TPS holders from Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen.The American Immigration Lawyers Association government relations director said that the proposal ""would categorically block tens of thousands of children from ever applying for asylum,"" while a Cato Institute immigration analyst wrote that the proposal would not extend DACA, but rather replace it with ""a totally different program that will exclude untold thousands of Dreamers who would have been eligible under DACA.""\n\nDemocrats rejected Trump\'s proposal.In a speech on the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""The president\'s proposal is one-sided, harshly partisan and was made in bad faith.The asylum changes are a poison pill, if there ever was one.""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said extending the DACA proposal temporarily was ""unacceptable"" and a ""non-starter"" because it did not ""represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people\'s lives.""Analysts pointed out that Trump had previously rejected a deal that would have provided funding for the border wall in exchange for further protection for DACA recipients.Conversely, Republicans reacted positively to Trump\'s proposal, and Mitch McConnell said he would bring it to a vote in the Senate.\n\nDuring the shutdown, on January 8 in a press conference, a reporter asked Trump if he was considering declaring a national emergency, to which Trump replied, ""I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want"" and suggested that he could declare an emergency.After this, Trump repeatedly threatened to declare a national emergency to unilaterally order wall construction without congressional authorization.Some of Trump\'s advisors, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, reportedly attempted to dissuade him from doing so.Administration officials considered diverting hurricane-relief and wildfire-relief funds from a $13.9 billion February 2018 emergency supplemental appropriations bill (for disaster relief in Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California, among other places) in order to fund a wall, and directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to look into this possibility.\n\nAn attempt by Trump to invoke emergency powers would almost certainly have prompted a lengthy legal challenge in court.Democrats responded that Trump lacked the authority to declare a national emergency; Representative Adam Schiff called it a ""non-starter"" and said that ""if Harry Truman couldn\'t nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this President doesn\'t have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion dollar wall on the border.""Democratic Representative Nydia Velázquez said the notion of redirecting disaster-relief funds to a border wall was ""beyond appalling"".Presidents have declared emergencies in the past, but none has ""involved funding a policy goal after failing to win congressional approval"".Yale Law School professor Bruce Ackerman wrote that the declaration of a national emergency to build a wall as Trump suggested would be unconstitutional and illegal.Other scholars, such as Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice, believed that Trump could make a colorable argument that diverting military-construction appropriations for border-wall construction was legal, but that doing so would be an abuse of power.Law professor Ilya Somin stated that in the unlikely case that Trump succeeded in using the emergency powers in this way, it would set a dangerous precedent, which Republicans would come to regret next time the president was a Democrat.\n\nOn January 11, Trump—while maintaining he has the authority to do so anytime—said he was not in any rush to declare a national emergency to secure wall funding, saying he would rather see Congress ""do its job"" and that the Democrats ""should come back and vote.""The next day he again threatened to use emergency powers if Democrats did not ""come to their senses.""\n\nOn January 16, Pelosi sent a letter to Trump that indicated the House would be unavailable for the 2019 State of the Union Address that was scheduled for January 29.Pelosi wrote, ""Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government reopens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has reopened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on Jan. 29.""The delivery of the State of the Union address had been delayed or substantially changed on only two occasions since 1913.In a letter sent to the Speaker the next day, Trump said she would not be allowed to take military transport aircraft on scheduled visits to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan.Trump replied, ""We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the shutdown is over.""Pelosi and a congressional delegation had planned on visiting overseas American military personnel.\n\nOn January 23, Trump sent a letter to Pelosi insisting that there were no security concerns and that he would hold the State of the Union Address as scheduled.Trump wrote, ""Therefore, I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and Congress of the United States of America regarding the State of our Union.""In a letter sent in reply, Pelosi stated that the House would not consider a concurrent resolution to authorize the State of the Union Address in the House Chamber until the shutdown ended, writing, ""Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened.""\n\nTrump later stated he would look for an alternative, but then retracted that statement in a pair of tweets announcing that he would wait until the end of the shutdown to give the address in the House Chamber.\n\nOn January 25, Trump announced his support for a three-week funding measure that would reopen the government until February 15.The deal, which also moved forward with long-term Department of Homeland Security funding, did not include funds for a wall.As expected, the agreement provided federal employees with back pay.Both the Senate and House of Representatives passed the funding measure by voice vote, sending the resolution to the President\'s desk.Trump signed the bill the same day, ending the shutdown.\n\nLater in January, Republican senators voted unanimously against a bill to provide back pay to federal contractors.\n\nWithout legislation enacted by February 15, a new partial shutdown would have begun, three weeks after the last ended.A bipartisan group of senators and representatives reached an agreement ""in principle"" on February 11, but Trump did not say whether he would sign it.Included was $1.375 billion for 55 miles of steel border fencing.On February 13, it was reported that, against the wishes of Democratic leaders and many Republicans, Trump was blocking the provision of back pay to federal contractors who were still out of pocket from the shutdown.Both houses passed the bill February 14 with enough votes to override a veto if that happened.\n\nOn February 15, at the White House Rose Garden, Trump announced that he had signed the spending bill to keep the government open.He also declared a national emergency, hoping to get access to $8 billion to use for border security.\n\nAgencies funded by two ""minibus"" appropriations bills passed in September 2018 were not affected by the shutdown.About 380,000 federal employees were furloughed, and an additional 420,000 employees for the affected agencies were expected to work with their pay delayed until the end of the shutdown, totaling 800,000 workers affected out of 2.1 million civilian non-postal federal employees.As only about a quarter of the government was shut down, many people who are not federal employees did not fully realize the effects of the shutdown.\n\nAccording to and , these were the affected agencies:\n\nDepartment of State Department of the Treasury Department of Justice Most of the Department of the Interior Department of Agriculture Department of Commerce Department of Housing and Urban Development Department of Transportation Department of Homeland Security Some Department of Health and Human Services agencies Food and Drug Administration Indian Health Service Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Superfund Research Program Executive Office of the President Most independent agencies Judicial Branch\n\nUnaffected agencies include, according to and :\n\nDepartment of Defense Department of Labor Most of the Department of Health and Human Services Department of Energy Department of Education Department of Veterans Affairs Some Department of the Interior agencies Bureau of Reclamation Central Utah Project District of Columbia (excluding courts) Legislative Branch Social Security Administration Nuclear Regulatory Commission Appalachian Regional Commission Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board Delta Regional Authority Denali Commission Northern Border Regional Commission Southeast Crescent Regional Commission Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board American Battle Monuments Commission U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Cemeterial Expenses of the Army, including Arlington National Cemetery and Soldiers\' and Airmen\'s Home National Cemetery Armed Forces Retirement Home Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System Fund Intelligence Community Management Account Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled Corporation for National and Community Service Corporation for Public Broadcasting Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission Institute of Museum and Library Services Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission Medicare Payment Advisory Commission National Council on Disability National Labor Relations Board National Mediation Board Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission Railroad Retirement Board\n\nJobs affected included staff throughout the United States, not just DC area employees.FBI agents, federal corrections officers, FDA inspectors, NASA employees, TSA staff, Border Patrol staff and CBP officers, census staff, National Park Service staff, members of the Coast Guard, and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers either worked without pay or were furloughed, with increasing numbers of unpaid essential employees failing to show up for work.\n\nOn January 11, 800,000 workers for agencies shutdown or furloughed missed their first paycheck.Federal workers normally receive pay on federal holidays, which include Christmas, New Year\'s Day and potentially Martin Luther King Jr. Day.The shutdown affected the employees\' entitlement to paid holidays due to the shutdown.Unemployment assistance to federal workers furloughed under the government shutdown varied by locality.Only non-reporting workers were eligible for assistance, whereas furloughed workers who still reported to work were not.Workers who received unemployment assistance were required pay it back after the shut down ended and they received backpay.Some furloughed workers sought other employment opportunities while they were idled.However, external employment must meet agency-specific ethics guidelines, and mandatory reviews of external employment were also curtailed as most ethics officials were also furloughed.Federal employees were not able to use vacation or sick leave during the shutdown so scheduled holiday vacation time either became unpaid if the worker was deemed non-essential or was cancelled if the worker was deemed essential.In many cases unused leave over a certain threshold expired at year-end, but employees who had leave scheduled in advance of the shutdown did not have ""use or lose"" leave balances deducted from their accrued leave.Many furloughed employees took to crowd-funding campaigns to raise cash to replace missed paychecks, but these types of solicitations also run afoul of government ethics rules.\n\nAs furloughed federal workers and their families shared stories of their hardships, such as not being able to meet rent or mortgage payments and missed bills, the hashtag ""#ShutdownStories"" went viral on social media.The federal government\'s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) responded by publishing sample letters that employees could send to their creditors.One read, in part, ""I am a Federal employee who has recently been furloughed due to a lack of funding of my agency.Because of this, my income has been severely cut and I am unable to pay the entire cost of my mortgage, along with my other expenses.""Other federal workers reached out to other news outlets to share stories about having to stretch their budgets and the impact of the shutdown on their families.In addition to being unable to meet rent or pay bills, many federal workers around the country were unable to pay for groceries and turned to food banks.One federal prison guard in Louisiana attempted suicide after posting about the financial pressures of the shutdown on Facebook.\n\nThe OPM also suggested that employees who had landlords write: ""I would like to discuss with you the possibility of trading my services to perform maintenance (e.g. painting, carpentry work) in exchange for partial rent payments"" and suggested those who lacked funds to pay bills should hire personal attorneys to assist them.Other organizations also posted advice on how to ""find supplemental income""; the Coast Guard suggested that Coast Guard members ""have a garage sale, offer to watch children, walk pets or house sit"" while furloughed.\n\nOn January 4, The Washington Post reported that because the shutdown was triggered by the failure to enact spending bills that continued a federal government pay freeze, hundreds of senior Trump administration political appointees would receive a roughly $10,000 pay raise the following day.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the pending pay raise was an ""unnecessary byproduct of the shutdown.""\n\nOn January 10, the Senate approved by unanimous consent a bill (S.24, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019) providing that furloughed federal employees would receive back pay for the period of the furlough once appropriations were restored; the bill was approved the next day by the House on a vote of 411–7.Trump signed the bill into law on January 16.\n\nNative American tribes were not paid for treaties negotiated with the United States government.These treaties specified that the federal government must provide funding for health clinics, employee salaries, education, infrastructure and other services, which were not paid during the shutdown.Native lands are ""owned, managed and maintained by the federal government.""Native Americans who receive a per capita check for profits from oil and gas sales from tribal land did not receive check for the month of February.Roads were not plowed on tribal land, and some areas received significant snowfall.This caused people of the Navajo Nation to become trapped inside their homes.Food services, which fed 90,000 Native Americans in 2017, were halted.\n\nNative American communities had a high percentage of individuals who worked for the federal government and lost income during the shutdown.In North and South Dakota, one of the largest employers is the Indian Health Service.The Chippewa tribe reported an economic loss of nearly $100,000 daily in funds that the federal government was supposed to provide as a treaty obligation.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was closed for the shutdown.However, 60 percent of the Indian Health Service (IHS) continued to work without pay.IHS provides care for 2.2 million Native Americans and on January 23, began to deny care that was not considered ""life threatening.""The Bureau of Indian Education was able to stay open because it was funded on a different schedule.Unlike other government shutdowns, there was little outreach from the Trump Administration to Native Americans and the Chippewa tribe in Michigan was given a 24-hour notice that the shutdown would take place and affect the tribe.\n\nThe only military branch that was affected by the shutdown was the Coast Guard because it was part of the Department of Homeland Security, while the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps were all funded through the Department of Defense.Officials were able to fund payment on December 31, 2018, but were not able to do so for the paychecks of January 15 and 30, 2019, along with the pay and benefits for civilian workers and retirees.During the shutdown, the Coast Guard continued to engage in patrolling the American coastline and carrying out overseas missions in locations such as the Persian Gulf along with the Navy and in the Caribbean.Other issues arose in the payment processes for Coast Guard members Tricare Health and Dental Program payments, although the individuals were still covered.\n\nMilitary schools, such as the Coast Guard Academy and the National War College, lost funding due to the shutdown and the schools had to work to find funds to pay professors.\n\nAlthough the Department of Defense was not shut down, the February 4, 2019, date for release of the Pentagon\'s 2020 budget was delayed by at least one month.This had repercussions on the interim period which is usually used by Pentagon planners for adjustments before the 2020 fiscal year which will begin in October 2019.The White House Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the Pentagon request, was shut down when the Pentagon budget arrived in December, and remained inactive, so no work was done on the budget.\n\nOn February 25, 2019, the Pentagon\'s counter-drug (interdiction) funding has up to $85 million not yet obligated, but that money was planned for the known corridors in El Paso, Tucson, Yuma, and El Centro for border fencing, lighting, and road projects, so any funds which might possibly be intended for additional projects elsewhere along the border must be obligated by September 30, 2019, in order not to affect the known corridors.Otherwise appropriations above the $85 million not yet obligated for additional interdiction border projects will have to be approved by additional Congressional appropriations, to reach the $2 billion target.\n\nA January 28, 2019 Congressional Budget Office report estimated that the 35-day partial government shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion, including $3 billion in permanent losses; the CBO estimate excluded indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.The furloughing of 145,000 federal workers and 112,500 federal contractors in the Washington Metropolitan Area cost the regional economy $119 million each day, or 7.3% of the region\'s total output.That reduced GDP by over $2.8 billion in the Washington DC area alone.The shutdown also had a noticeable impact on hunger in the national capital region: food pantries in Washington DC and Northern Virginia reported an increase of around 10% in the number of people coming to pick up groceries, with most of that increase coming from federal workers and contractors.\n\nFitch Ratings warned that an extended shutdown might lead to a downgrade in the U.S.\'s Triple-A credit rating if lawmakers were unable to pass a budget or manage the debt ceiling.That in turn would make borrowing more costly for companies and American households, because it is the benchmark for many other lines of credit.The only time the U.S. credit rating has been downgraded by S&P was during the United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011.\n\nSome economists believed that an extended shutdown would weaken consumer confidence and heighten the risk of pushing the U.S. economy into a recession.Between 800,000 federal government employees and some 4 million federal contractors, the shutdown directly affected nearly 3% of the labor force of the United States; in a typical recession, unemployment increases 2–4%.The reduction in spending by those households combined with the reduction of government services could have macroeconomic results similar to a typical recession.The shutdown had an adverse effect on the budgets of state and local governments, as states covered some federal services (particularly the most vulnerable) during the shutdown.\n\nBy mid-January 2019, the White House Council of Economic Advisors estimated that each week of the shutdown reduced GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, the equivalent of 1.2 points per quarter.CEA chairman Kevin Hassett later acknowledged that GDP growth could decline to zero in the first quarter of 2019 if the shutdown lasted the entire quarter.\n\nAs tax season began in the United States on January 28, some 46,000 Internal Revenue Service workers were called back to work to ensure tax refunds and returns were not affected by the shutdown.The recalled workers allowed the department to continue operations that were automatic and those deemed necessary for the safety of human life or protection of government property, such as processing electronic returns, returns with payments, mailing tax forms, appeals, criminal law enforcement investigations and technical support.\n\nDuring the shutdown, 95% of federal staff for the USDA\'s Food and Nutrition Services were furloughed.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the food-stamp program, could be funded through a $3 billion contingency fund appropriated by Congress in 2018; if the shutdown had continued through March 2019, those funds would have been exhausted, leaving some 38 million Americans without food stamps and endangering food security.Concerns were raised that continuation of the shutdown could delay the issuance of some $140 billion in tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees most of the food supply in the U.S.In early January, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner, reported that the FDA suspended food inspections.He noted that inspection of foreign food was continuing as ""almost normal,"" because they are considered vital.Around January 14, ""high-risk"" food inspections resumed.As of January 22, 2019, 46 percent of the FDA were working, though 20 percent of them were working without pay.During the shutdown, two new recalls for contamination with Listeria or Salmonella took place.Consumer advocacy groups advised of food safety issues during the shutdown.Food safety attorney, Bill Marler, advocated against eating ""fresh, uncooked products on the market place.""Because there was a shortage of FDA inspectors, many imported perishable items, such as produce or flowers, were at risk of spoilage.Meat and some egg products are inspected by the USDA\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service.Federal legislation required those inspectors to remain working without pay.\n\nSchool administrations raised concern about how to feed children who purchase food at the schools for lunch, as funding concerns caused some districts to conserve food and funding.Many limited the amount or variation of foods available for the children to purchase, and alerted parents to the concerns and the limited availability of some of the items.Most schools affected were in high-poverty areas, and depended on federally funded lunch programs, such as the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) a federal grant established by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 and operated through the Department of Agriculture.Some 22 million students in nearly 100,000 schools received school meals through that operation.\n\nAs with the January 2018 shutdown, national parks were expected to be open to the extent practical, though there would be no staff and buildings would be closed.The shutdown affected national parks unevenly, some were accessible with bare-bones staffing levels, some operated with money from states or charitable groups, and others were locked off.Diane Regas, president and chief executive of the Trust for Public Land, called upon Trump to close all national parks to protect the public: by the third week of the shutdown, three people had died in national parks.This number was reported as being within \'usual\' levels.At Yosemite National Park, on January 4, 2019, a death from a fall went unreported for a week.\n\nBy January 1, 2019, the problems of neglected trash pileup, overflowing public toilets, and access to first aid were repeated across the Park system.Health and safety concerns were raised, with concerns by scientists that the expansive amount of garbage and human waste could impact water and soil quality, or cause damage to animals in the parks.Other issues that arose due to the shutdown included illegal campsites, protected agriculture being damaged, damaging of government property and trespassing on foot and by vehicle.\n\nNew York kept the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open, as it did during the January 2018 shutdown.Arizona and Utah were able to keep Grand Canyon National Park, Zion National Park, Arches National Park, and Bryce Canyon National Park open and provided services including public restrooms, shuttles and trash collection.Utah\'s funding included visitor centers.The sites closed outright in the southwest alone included Bandelier National Monument and Valles Caldera National Preserve in northern New Mexico, White Sands National Monument in southern New Mexico, Petrified Forest National Park in northern Arizona and Casa Grande Ruins National Monument in south-central Arizona.Access to major parts of Sequoia and Kings Canyon parks were closed, and at Joshua Tree National Park, the administration policy of leaving parks open to visitors despite the staff furloughs resulted in park damage, including the toppling of protected trees.In Texas, Big Bend National Park had no visitor services, such as restrooms.Some trailheads were closed.Regulations continued to be enforced, as the park remained open.Visitors were reminded to remove their own trash and toilet paper.The Alamo remained open but no NPS services were available at the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park.Channel Islands National Park remained open to public access, although services normally provided by the national park service were instead provided by Island Packers Cruises, the company normally in charge of ferries to the islands.\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration closed immediately on December 22, 2018.The Library of Congress, the U.S. Botanic Garden, the Capitol Visitor Center, and the U.S. Capitol Building remained open as they were funded by the 2019 Legislative Branch appropriations bill.The Smithsonian Institution operated on ""prior-year funds"" through January 1, 2019.On January 2, 2019, the Smithsonian Institution initiated an orderly shutdown of all its facilities, including 19 museums in Washington, D.C., and New York City, the National Zoo, and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.The following day, the National Gallery of Art was closed.The National Zoo also closed on January 3, 2019.Tourism attendance on the National Mall was affected.On January 5, 2019, acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt directed the diversion of fee revenue defined by the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to be used to fund minimal maintenance activities so as to preserve access to highly visited parks.\n\nAccording to a January 12, 2019, article in The Economist, on January 11, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was unable to pay its workers who had not been paid since December 22; 55% more of them called in sick than in January 2018.\n\nAs the air traffic controllers were deemed essential employees, they were required to work without pay.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents air traffic controllers, filed a lawsuit against the federal government for the shutdown on January 11, 2019, claiming that requiring 16,000 air traffic controllers to work without being paid violated their constitutional rights and federal minimum wage law.That was the third lawsuit filed against the federal government since the beginning of the shutdown.\n\nAirline and aircraft safety inspectors, on the other hand, were deemed nonessential and furloughed.A news report on January 12, 2019, stated that the Federal Aviation Administration had returned 500 furloughed safety inspectors back to work and would return more to work in the following weeks.As the airline and aircraft safety inspectors were furloughed, the certification process of the Airbus A220 in the US was stalled.Delta Air Lines was forced to delay the launch of the new aircraft, and to use other models of aircraft to serve those routes that was supposed to be served with A220.Many TSA employees also called out sick, most of them because they were trying to find other jobs that would provide immediate paychecks.\n\nThe shutdown initially prevented the National Transportation Safety Board from assisting the Mexican government\'s investigation of the 2018 Puebla helicopter crash that killed a state governor and senator; an exception allowed the NTSB to assist with the Mexican government in the investigation along with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.The NTSB also had to delay several investigations until the government reopened and only continued investigations into accidents that were considered the most serious.Issues in receiving certification and oversight from the FAA led to a month-long delay in the commencement of passenger service at Paine Field in Everett, Washington.\n\nAs the shutdown continued into its fourth week, the unions representing airline pilots, flight attendants and air traffic controllers issued a statement asserting, ""we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play"" because of the shutdown.\n\nSome airports such as the Philadelphia International Airport, launched food and item donations for federal employees who were affected by the shutdown.Other airports such as the Miami International Airport, and the George Bush International Airport, closed down terminals in order to spread out the TSA workers that were available.\n\nOn January 25, flights destined for LaGuardia Airport in New York were halted to a groundstop by FAA officials due to staffing shortages directly as a result of the shutdown.As a result, several flights to and from neighboring airports in the Northeast, specifically Philadelphia and Newark, suffered significant delays of their own.Soon after that, appropriations passed and the government reopened.\n\nThe shutdown delayed software updates to the Boeing 737 MAX airplane which may have caused the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.\n\nDuring the shutdown, court-appointed private lawyers who represent indigent defendants worked without pay.The Federal Judiciary initially had a goal of sustaining paid operations through January 18, 2019.It said it would run out of money to sustain court operations no earlier than January 25, but perhaps as late as February 1.Failing funding, the Judiciary would operate under the terms of the Antideficiency Act.This Act does not allow federal agencies to expend federal funds before an appropriation, nor to accept any voluntary services.The judiciary had 33,000 employees nationwide.Under the Constitution, Supreme Court Justices, appeals court judges and district judges would continue to be paid.\n\nThe shutdown caused many delays and disruptions in cases.Budgets were watched carefully to be able to pay public defenders, DNA testing, informants, and travel costs to interview victims and witnesses.Staffing issues also brought about concerns and constraints with prisons lacking the staff to safely hold attorney-client visits, and caused a delay in bail hearings.\n\nAgents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed in a report released on January 22, 2019, by the FBI Agents Association, that several different investigations were compromised by the shutdown.The report was called ""Voices from the Field"" and was 72 pages long.FBI agents were unable to pay Confidential Human Sources which risks losing that informant permanently.Some FBI divisions no longer have Spanish-speaking staff on hand and could not work with informants who only speak Spanish.Some agents reported that they did not have the funds to assist in joint operations with local law enforcement.\n\nFederal law enforcement agencies working on Native American land worked without pay through the shutdown.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was forced to cancel a trip to the United States/Mexico border in early January due to the shutdown.DHS was also unable to inspect Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities during the shutdown to ensure that immigrants were being held in facilities appropriately.During the shutdown, the federal government\'s e-Verify system—a system for employers to check the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States—was halted.\n\nDuring the shutdown, a wave of Domain Name System (DNS) attacks on government sites was detected by Homeland Security.The attacks were serious because these Internet sites could be hijacked.\n\nOfficial websites for agencies were rendered insecure or inaccessible through the shutdown, as the expired digital certificates were not renewed.On January 23, DHS asked all government agencies to secure their DNS records; however, many agencies were not able to respond quickly to this request.\n\nExecutive and legislative affairs of the local government of the District of Columbia continued operating through the shutdown, due to a provision previously enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017.The District\'s local court system, including the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, are part of the federal judiciary.Thus, they were partially shut down, preventing District residents from accessing services such as marriage licensing.The District of Columbia government said it would take over trash collection and snow plowing operations for National Park Service facilities in Washington.\n\nThe shutdown also interfered with the response to the 2018 Sunda Strait tsunami, as the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta\'s Twitter account was unable to tweet updates, and the United States Geological Survey was unable to provide data on the tsunami.The American weather model, the GFS, suffered a significant drop in forecast quality when a data format change during the shutdown prevented certain weather data from being recognized by the GFS, and the shutdown prevented the bug from being corrected.\n\nBy mid-day Thursday, January 3, 2019, the FCC had suspended operations.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai canceled his trip to the Consumer Electronics Show.The FTC also suspended certain online operations.The EPA and Department of Energy\'s Energy Star website was not available for the duration of the shutdown.\n\nMakers of alcoholic beverages were unable to receive approval from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau for new labels and recipes during the shutdown.\n\nBased on the recalculation of their operating reserves, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) would have had to cease patent operations in the second week of February.A cadre of personnel was allocated to continue receiving patent applications, receive payments, and maintain the IT infrastructure.Even though the USPTO is self-funded, a Congressional appropriation is required to permit the USPTO to spend money.The pipeline of patent applications at the time took 15.8 months for a response from an examiner.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution shortened to two days and downscaled its scheduled ten-day 2019 Folklife Festival on the National Mall because of the shutdown\'s effects.Sabrina Motley, the director of the festival, said that initially, crucial funding for the June—July event arrived later than expected, slowing preparations.Motley stated: ""The government opened back up, but it took a while for systems to come back online. ...We looked at our production schedule, and it became clear we would need more time than we had.""\n\nThe White House residence staff who stage public receptions were among those furloughed, with a minimal staff continuing to work unpaid for the first family.In the midst of the shutdown Trump invited the Clemson Tigers football team to a White House dinner reception on January 14 in recognition of their College Football Playoff National Championship win.On the morning of the reception Trump announced that he intended to serve fast food hamburgers and pizza to the team, a remark that some commentators interpreted as a joke.That evening Trump welcomed the team in the State Dining Room with a buffet of fast food and pizza from McDonald\'s, Wendy\'s and other restaurant chains, which he stated that he had paid for personally.Trump served fast food to other visiting athletes later that year, after the shutdown had ended.\n\nOn January 10, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with several other unions, announced plans to protest the government shutdown at 1:00pm EST in Washington, DC.Leaders of the National Federation of Federal Employees stated they had hoped that bringing federal workers to the President\'s doorstep would show him that it was the individual workers that the shutdown was hurting the most.President Trump had left to visit the US–Mexican border in Texas earlier in the day.\n\nSimilar protests took place in Philadelphia and St. Louis, among other cities.On January 15, representatives for Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, and Vietnam Veterans of America along with others called for an end to shutdown, but avoided placing any blame on political parties.\n\nShortly after the protests, the American Federation of Government Employees sued the Trump administration to challenge the arrangements for work without pay during the shutdown.A similar suit was raised and won during the 2013 Federal Government shutdown.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association also sued the Trump administration, as the shutdown allegedly violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by failing to pay the workers at least a minimum wage during the shutdown.\n\nAs the salaries for members of Congress are written into permanent law and not funded through annual appropriations, the government shutdown did not affect their salaries.Senators and Representatives were still paid their biweekly salaries of $6,700 towards at least $174,000 a year.\n\nSeveral Democratic and Republican Senators and Representatives said they would donate or refuse their salary during the shutdown.Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw stated that he would refuse his salary, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto indicated she would donate hers to a Nevada charity, Senator Mazie Hirono said she would donate her salary to Hawaii food banks, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would give hers to refugee non-profit HIAS, New York Congressman Max Rose stated that he would give his salary to charity and outgoing Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota pledged hers to charity, along with her Republican colleague John Hoeven.Republican senator Kevin Cramer, who defeated Heidi Heitkamp in the 2018 midterm elections, refused to donate his salary, calling the move ""gimmicky"".Representative Brian Fitzpatrick urged all members of Congress to decline their paychecks.He said, ""If you\'re in Congress, don\'t just delay your pay -- forfeit it, write a check back to the US Treasury.Then you\'ll feel the pain of federal workers.""\n\nBy January 17, 2019, 102 members of Congress—20 Senators and 82 Representatives— chose to decline their paychecks or were donating their paychecks to charity.\n\nDuring the shutdown, many federal workers used food banks and food pantries in order to feed themselves and their families.Many food pantries waived certain restrictions in order to help government workers have access to food.During the shutdown, the Salvation Army Emergency Disasters Services program provided meals for federal workers.Chef Jose Andres created the #ChefsForFeds program to feed federal workers in Washington, D.C. and by January 21, made announcements to expand the program nationwide.\n\nSome states such as California, offered furloughed employees unemployment benefits, although the Trump administration allegedly told states that they could not do so with federal funds.Organizations such as state Attorney Generals offices, and credit card companies posted statements to their websites to offer a means to help to consolidate debt, meet mortgages or other payments such as child support or tuition.An employment law firm offered pro bono legal advice to furloughed federal employees.School districts opened up free or reduced lunch options for children of federal employees, and looked into other options to aid parents amid concerns that financial stress at home would adversely affect families and children.Every mainline denomination in America has contributed to efforts to provide relief.One Baptist church emptied its entire disaster fund to aid federal employees.\n\nOn January 24, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross downplayed the financial difficulties faced by the 800,000 federal workers affected by the shutdown, stating that they should borrow money to ""tide them over"" until the shutdown ends.Critics and Democrats criticized the statement as inappropriate, noting that Ross\' own net worth is estimated at almost $700 million, accusing him of being out of touch with the workers.Ross also said that he ""did not understand"" why people who were not getting paid due to the shutdown were visiting food banks.When asked about Ross\' statement, Trump suggested that grocery stores will ""work along"" with the government by voluntarily extending credit to those who are out of funds to buy food.National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow characterized the shutdown as a ""glitch"" and suggested that federal workers who were required to work without pay were ""volunteering"" to work for their love of the country and ""presumably their allegiance to President Trump.""\n\nIn a video message to staff, FBI director Christopher Wray stated, ""Making some people stay home when they don\'t want to, and making others show up without pay, it\'s mind-boggling, it\'s shortsighted and it\'s unfair.It takes a lot to get me angry, but I\'m about as angry as I\'ve been in a long, long time.""\n\nLara Trump, a daughter-in-law of the President, drew outrage after an interview in which she stated that while ""It\'s not fair to you..."" the shutdown was ""...a little bit of pain, but it\'s going to be for the future of our country, and their children and their grandchildren and generations after them will thank them for their sacrifice right now.""Her comments drew criticism by politicians, celebrities, and the general public who felt the advisor and spokeswoman for the Trump 2020 campaign was out of touch, however Lara Trump later claimed the comments were taken out of context.\n\nIn January 2019, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that 56% of the responding public opposed a wall while 39% favored it, and 45% viewed the situation at the border as a crisis.The numbers were similar to the poll in December 2018 yet a later poll by ABC News showed that as the partial shutdown entered its fourth week support for building a wall was increasing.A poll done through YouGov between December 23–25, 2018, reported that 51% of respondents thought Trump deserved ""a lot"" of the blame, 44% thought congressional Democrats and 39% thought congressional Republicans.Similar results were reported by a December 21–25 survey done by Reuters and Ipsos in which 47% of respondents said that the shutdown was the President\'s fault and 33% blamed Congressional Democrats.\n\nOver the course of the shutdown, Trump\'s approval rating marginally declined while his disapproval rating marginally increased.His net approval rating was by the middle of January 2019 at its lowest point since February 2018.On December 27, 2018, it was reported that Trump\'s approval rating of registered voters was at 39%, with 56% disapproval.Broken down the rating was split across party lines, with Republicans reporting an 80% approval rate while Democrats and independents reported a 90% and 57% disapproval rating, respectively.The poll was conducted through Morning Consult between December 21–23.The poll also reported that 43% of respondents blamed Trump for the shutdown, with 31% blaming congressional Democrats and 7% congressional Republicans.Another poll through The New York Times Upshot/Siena College reported that 89% of voters\' views on Trump and the wall were aligned, suggesting that support for the wall was a function of support for Trump.\n\nThe Washington Post–ABC News poll published on January 13, 2019, found that a larger number of Americans blamed Trump and congressional Republicans than congressional Democrats for the shutdown.A PBS NewsHour–Marist poll found that on January 15, 2019, a majority of Americans thought that President Trump was to blame for the shutdown.A January 2019 poll conducted by telephone for CBS News found that 70% of Americans polled did not want a government shutdown over the issue of building a border wall; 66% believed that Trump should agree to a budget without wall funding.\n\nPresidency of Donald Trump Donald Trump January 2018 United

53,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018–2019 United States federal government shutdown', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The United States federal government shutdown from midnight EST on December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019 (35 days) was the longest government shutdown in history and the second and final federal government shutdown involving furloughs during the presidency of Donald Trump.It occurred when the 115th Congress and Trump could not agree on an appropriations bill to fund the operations of the federal government for the 2019 fiscal year, or a temporary continuing resolution that would extend the deadline for passing a bill.The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal departments or agencies from conducting non-essential operations without appropriations legislation in place.As a result, nine executive departments with around 800,000 employees had to shut down partially or in full, affecting about one-fourth of government activities and causing employees to be furloughed or required to work without being paid.The Congressional Budget Office estimated the shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion USD, excluding indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.\n\nThe shutdown stemmed from an impasse over Trump\'s demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall.In December 2018, the Senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the bill appeared likely to be approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Trump.After Trump faced heavy criticism from some right-wing media outlets and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to ""build the wall"", he announced that he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund its construction.As a result, the House passed a stopgap bill with funding for the wall, but it was blocked in the Senate by the threat of a Democratic filibuster.\n\nIn January 2019, representatives elected in the November 2018 election took office, giving the Democrats a majority in the House.The House immediately voted to approve the appropriations bill that had previously passed the Senate unanimously (which included no funding for the wall).For several weeks, Trump continued to maintain that he would veto any bill that did not fund an entire border wall, and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the Senate from considering any appropriations legislation that Trump would not support, including the bill that had previously passed.Democrats and some Republicans opposed the shutdown and passed multiple bills to reopen the government, arguing that the government shutdown amounted to ""hostage-taking"" civil servants and that negotiations could only begin once the government was reopened.\n\nOn January 25, 2019, Trump agreed to endorse a stopgap bill to reopen the government for three weeks up until February 15 to allow for negotiations to take place to approve an appropriations bill that both parties could agree on.However, Trump reiterated his demand for the border wall funding and said that he would shut down the government again or declare a national emergency and use military funding to build the wall if Congress did not appropriate the funds by February 15.\n\nTrump\'s approval rating dropped during the shutdown.A majority of Americans opposed exploitation of the shutdown as a negotiating strategy and held Trump responsible for the shutdown: A CBS News poll found that 71% of Americans considered the border wall ""not worth the shutdown"" and a Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 53% of Americans blamed Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, compared to 34% who blamed Democrats and 10% who blamed both parties.\n\nOn February 15, 2019, Trump declared a national emergency to fund the wall and bypass Congress, after being unsatisfied with a bipartisan border bill that had passed the House and the Senate a day before.\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign, then-candidate Trump promised to build a wall along the Mexico–United States border for which Mexico would pay.The president of Mexico rejected the idea of providing any funding for a U.S. border wall.In 2018, Trump requested $ in federal funding for some of barrier on the border, mostly to replace of aging fence built under the Secure Fence Act of 2006.On December 25, 2018, Trump reversed course, suggesting that he might accept of either mostly refurbished barrier (rather than new barriers in locations that did not previously have them) by November 2020.Trump\'s proposals and public statements on the wall have shifted widely over time, with varied proposals as to the design, material, length, height, and width of a wall.\n\nIn September 2018, Congress passed two ""minibus"" appropriations bills for the 2019 United States federal budget, which began on October 1, 2018.These bills combined five of the 12 regular appropriations bills covering 77% of federal discretionary funding, and included a continuing resolution until December 7 for the remaining agencies.On December 6, Congress passed a second continuing resolution to December 21, to give more time for negotiations on Trump\'s proposed border wall, which had been delayed due to the funeral of George H. W. Bush.\n\nA Senate Homeland Security appropriations bill, negotiated by both parties and reported by the committee to the Senate, provided for $ for border security, including funds for ""approximately 65 miles of pedestrian fencing along the southwest border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector"".The bill did not receive a vote on the Senate floor, although House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer indicated that such a proposal could be acceptable to House Democrats.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said the Democratic Party would not support $ for the border wall.At a press conference before the government shutdown, he noted ""the $1.6 billion for border security negotiated by Democrats and Republicans is our position.We believe that is the right way to go.""\n\nOn December 11, President Trump held a televised meeting with Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in the Oval Office and asked them to support an appropriation of $5.7 billion for funding of a border wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico.They refused, resulting in an argument between Trump and both Congressional leaders.During the contentious discussion, Trump remarked, ""I am proud to shut down the government for border security ...I will be the one to shut [the government] down.I\'m not going to blame you for it ...I will take the mantle.I will be the one to shut it down.""Schumer replied, ""We shouldn\'t shut down the government over a dispute.""Ten days later, Trump blamed Democrats for the impending shutdown.\n\nThree days later, Politico reported that Trump was willing to sign a bill with no funding for a border wall that delayed a government shutdown into 2019 and the new Congress.On December 18, following a meeting with Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the government would not shut down on December 22 and that Trump was ""flexible"" over funding for a border wall.Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby commented that the most likely resolution was a bill that funded the government until early February.Schumer added that his caucus would ""very seriously"" consider such a bill and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said ""I don\'t know anybody on the Hill that wants a shutdown, and I think all the president\'s advisers are telling him this would not be good.""\n\nOn December 19, the Senate passed a second continuing resolution () that would fund the government until February 8, 2019.Pelosi announced that House Democrats would support the measure, meaning it would overcome opposition from conservative Republicans and pass the House.On December 20, following increased criticism from conservative media, pundits, and political figures, Trump reversed his position and declared that he would not sign any funding bill that did not include border wall funding.The same day, the House passed a continuing resolution that included $5 billion for the wall and $8 billion in disaster aid.This bill failed in the Senate.Trump\'s changing position caused consternation among Senate Republicans.\n\nThe shutdown started December 22 and Trump announced that he would cancel his planned trip to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas and stay in Washington, D.C.The meaning of the term ""wall"" was expected to be an aspect of the negotiations.\n\nCongress adjourned on December 22 for the Christmas and holiday season, with many predicting that the shutdown would not be resolved until the start of the 116th Congress.The Senate reconvened on December 27 for four minutes, with Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) presiding over the session.The House briefly reconvened as well, with Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) saying that members should not expect any further votes for the rest of 2018.Representative Jim McGovern (D-MA) went to the House floor to try to force consideration of a short-term funding bill to end the shutdown that the Senate had already passed, but the Republican Speaker-pro-tem refused to let him speak.\n\nCongress then adjourned again until December 31, 2018, for a pro forma session.On January 2, 2019, the last full day of the 115th United States Congress, there was a pro forma session scheduled to last several minutes.\n\nThe new Congress was sworn in on January 3, 2019, and one of the first orders of business in the House after electing the Speaker and swearing in the new members was a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security until February 8 (), which passed by a vote of 239–192; and a package combining five appropriation bills funding the rest of the government for the remainder of the fiscal year (), passed by a vote of 241–190.The bills contained $1.3 billion of funding for border security, but no additional funding for a border wall.\n\nBeginning on January 9, the Democratic-controlled House voted on four appropriations bills individually:\n\nFinancial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Treasury (including the Internal Revenue Service), federal judiciary, District of Columbia, and a number of independent agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, General Services Administration, and Securities and Exchange Commission.The House passed the legislation on January 9, on a 240–188 vote, with every Democrat and eight Republicans voting yes, and all other Republicans voting no. Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Department of Agriculture (including food stamps), the Food and Drug Administration, and related entities.On January 10, the House passed this bill 243–183.Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore Transportation and Housing and Urban Development (including some federal mortgage programs).On January 10, the House passed this bill 244–180.Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Interior Department, Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies, including the Smithsonian Institution.On January 11, ten House Republicans voted with Democrats in a 240–179 vote to end the shutdown of Interior-Environment programs.It was the most recent of a ""series of standalone appropriations measures"" the House sent to the Senate.\n\nThis strategy has been compared to one used by Republicans during the 2013 shutdown in the form of a series of fourteen mini-continuing resolutions.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed that the Senate would not consider the House bills to reopen the government, indicating that Senate Republicans would not support any bill unless it had Trump\'s support.In January 2019, McConnell and Senate Republicans came under increased pressure to break the impasse and reopen the government.Three Republican Senators—Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Cory Gardner of Colorado—called for an end to the shutdown.Senators Collins and Gardner said they supported the House\'s budget bills to end the shutdown.West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito said that she could support ending the shutdown provided border wall talks continued.Pat Roberts of Kansas said that shutdowns ""never work"" and only turned affected federal workers into ""pawns"" and that, although the time had not yet come for Senate Republicans to override any possible Trump veto and end the shutdown, ""we\'re getting pretty close.""Johnny Isakson of Georgia echoed that sentiment, saying that support for McConnell\'s refusal to support bills that do not include funding for a wall would not last indefinitely: ""There\'s a time when that may run out.""\n\nOn January 16, McConnell again blocked the House appropriation bills to reopen the government from being considered on the Senate floor.The following day, McConnell blocked consideration of bills to reopen most of the closed government agencies for a third time.On January 23, McConnell blocked a bill to reopen most of the government for the fourth time.\n\nOn January 22, McConnell stated that the Senate would be voting on two different bills to end the shutdown on January 24.The first vote is on a bill to reopen the government which includes Trump\'s proposal to provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and temporary protections to some immigration classes.The other bill is a three-week continuing resolution to fund 25% of the government through February 8.\n\nOn January 22, Senator Mark Warner introduced a bill to keep the federal government running in the event of future shutdown events.The bill is called the ""Stop Shutdowns Transferring Unnecessary Pain and Inflicting Damage in the Coming Years Act"" or the ""Stop STUPIDITY Act"".\n\nOn January 24, the Senate held two votes on competing Democratic and Republican proposals to end the shutdown.The Democratic proposal was largely similar to the measure that had previously passed the Senate unanimously in the 115th Congress, and then been passed by the Democratic-controlled House in the 116th Congress.It provided funding for the government with no money for the border wall.The Republican proposal incorporated Trump\'s proposal, which would fund a border wall; temporarily extend TPS and DACA for three years, but would substantially narrow eligibility for DACA; and make significant legal changes to make it more difficult for persons escaping violence and persecution to be granted asylum in the United States.Neither proposal was able to attain the 60 votes needed for passage.The Trump plan failed in a 50–47 vote.The Democratic plan failed in a 52–44 vote.Most Republicans voted for Trump\'s plan and against the Democratic plan.Most Democrats voted for the Democratic plan and against Trump\'s plan.Republicans Tom Cotton and Mike Lee voted against both plans.Democrat Joe Manchin and Republicans Lamar Alexander, Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, Johnny Isakson, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney voted for both plans.Not voting on either were Republicans Rand Paul and Jim Risch and Democrat Jacky Rosen.Republican Richard Burr voted for Trump\'s plan and did not vote on the Democratic plan.\n\nOn January 25, House Democrats prepared a compromise proposal to reopen the government, which would provide $5 billion for border security but no wall construction.However, the shutdown ended the same day.\n\nOn January 4, after the new Congress was sworn-in and Pelosi regained the speakership, she and Schumer, as well as congressional Republican leadership met with Trump at the White House.Pelosi and Schumer argued that the shutdown needed to end and reported that Trump refused.They said that Trump threatened to ""keep the government closed for a very long period of time.Months or even years.""Later that day, Trump admitted to ""absolutely"" making that threat, adding, ""I\'m very proud of doing what I\'m doing.""Trump then said that he was considering declaring a national emergency to use military funding for the wall.At the meeting, Trump reprimanded his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney for attempting to propose a compromise between Trump\'s $5.7 billion demand for a border wall and the Democrats\' proposal of $1.3 billion for border security.\n\nTrump addressed the nation from the Oval Office at 9 p.m. EST on January 8, in a nationally televised address broadcast on both network and cable television.In his speech, Trump asserted that there was a ""growing humanitarian and security crisis"" on the Mexico–United States border that could only be solved by appropriating $5.7 billion for construction of a steel wall.Trump did not make any new proposals in his speech to break the impasse.Immediately after Trump\'s speech, Schumer and Pelosi delivered a response on behalf of the Democrats, in which they demanded an end to the shutdown and said: ""President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government.""\n\nTrump met with congressional leadership again on January 9, in a meeting lasting 14 minutes.Trump asked Pelosi, ""Will you agree to my wall?"" and when she replied that she would not, Trump said ""bye-bye"" and walked out of the meeting, later declaring it ""a total waste of time"".Schumer accused Trump of throwing a ""temper tantrum"" and slamming his hands on the table.Trump rebuked Schumer\'s comments on Twitter.Vice President Mike Pence and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that Trump remained calm and never raised his voice.On January 10, Pelosi described the preceding day\'s meeting with Trump as ""a setup"" staged by White House aides so that Trump could walk out of the meeting.Pelosi described Trump as ""un-presidential""; accused him of ""exploiting this situation in a way that enhances his power""; and said: ""I don\'t think he really wants a solution.I think he loves the distraction.""\n\nAfter Trump walked out of the January 9 meeting with congressional Democratic leaders, no further negotiations were conducted.Several Republican senators met in the office of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, after the meeting to discuss a compromise to end the shutdown.They discussed agreeing to Trump\'s demand for border wall funding and offering the Democrats help for Dreamers, refugee protections and extensions to H-2B visas.On January 13, Graham proposed that Trump agree to a congressional vote to reopen the government pending the resumption of negotiations.Graham suggested that if Trump and congressional Democrats did not come to an agreement at that time, Trump could declare a national emergency.Trump rejected this proposal the next day.\n\nOn January 19, Trump proposed a temporary extension of the two programs that protect about 700,000 immigrants from deportation—Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)—in exchange for funding for the border wall.The protections would be temporary, with no path to citizenship.Trump had previously revoked TPS for people from a number of Latin American and African countries, and taken steps to rescind DACA.In his remarks at the White House, Trump referred to a ""barrier"" rather than a ""wall"" and indicated that he aimed to erect ""steel barriers in high priority locations"" rather than ""a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea.""\n\nIn addition to funding a border wall, the 1,300-page Republican bill released after Trump made his proposal would make major changes to U.S. immigration policy (which were not included in Trump\'s public announcement).The legislation would severely restrict the ability of children from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to apply for asylum in the United States.Specifically, participation in the Central American Minors Program would be subject to an annual cap and migrant children would be barred from applying for asylum in person at the border, and only migrant children with a ""qualified"" parent in the U.S. would be eligible to apply.The bill would also create a new, more burdensome application process for TPS holders, and would exclude TPS holders from Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen.The American Immigration Lawyers Association government relations director said that the proposal ""would categorically block tens of thousands of children from ever applying for asylum,"" while a Cato Institute immigration analyst wrote that the proposal would not extend DACA, but rather replace it with ""a totally different program that will exclude untold thousands of Dreamers who would have been eligible under DACA.""\n\nDemocrats rejected Trump\'s proposal.In a speech on the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""The president\'s proposal is one-sided, harshly partisan and was made in bad faith.The asylum changes are a poison pill, if there ever was one.""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said extending the DACA proposal temporarily was ""unacceptable"" and a ""non-starter"" because it did not ""represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people\'s lives.""Analysts pointed out that Trump had previously rejected a deal that would have provided funding for the border wall in exchange for further protection for DACA recipients.Conversely, Republicans reacted positively to Trump\'s proposal, and Mitch McConnell said he would bring it to a vote in the Senate.\n\nDuring the shutdown, on January 8 in a press conference, a reporter asked Trump if he was considering declaring a national emergency, to which Trump replied, ""I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want"" and suggested that he could declare an emergency.After this, Trump repeatedly threatened to declare a national emergency to unilaterally order wall construction without congressional authorization.Some of Trump\'s advisors, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, reportedly attempted to dissuade him from doing so.Administration officials considered diverting hurricane-relief and wildfire-relief funds from a $13.9 billion February 2018 emergency supplemental appropriations bill (for disaster relief in Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California, among other places) in order to fund a wall, and directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to look into this possibility.\n\nAn attempt by Trump to invoke emergency powers would almost certainly have prompted a lengthy legal challenge in court.Democrats responded that Trump lacked the authority to declare a national emergency; Representative Adam Schiff called it a ""non-starter"" and said that ""if Harry Truman couldn\'t nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this President doesn\'t have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion dollar wall on the border.""Democratic Representative Nydia Velázquez said the notion of redirecting disaster-relief funds to a border wall was ""beyond appalling"".Presidents have declared emergencies in the past, but none has ""involved funding a policy goal after failing to win congressional approval"".Yale Law School professor Bruce Ackerman wrote that the declaration of a national emergency to build a wall as Trump suggested would be unconstitutional and illegal.Other scholars, such as Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice, believed that Trump could make a colorable argument that diverting military-construction appropriations for border-wall construction was legal, but that doing so would be an abuse of power.Law professor Ilya Somin stated that in the unlikely case that Trump succeeded in using the emergency powers in this way, it would set a dangerous precedent, which Republicans would come to regret next time the president was a Democrat.\n\nOn January 11, Trump—while maintaining he has the authority to do so anytime—said he was not in any rush to declare a national emergency to secure wall funding, saying he would rather see Congress ""do its job"" and that the Democrats ""should come back and vote.""The next day he again threatened to use emergency powers if Democrats did not ""come to their senses.""\n\nOn January 16, Pelosi sent a letter to Trump that indicated the House would be unavailable for the 2019 State of the Union Address that was scheduled for January 29.Pelosi wrote, ""Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government reopens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has reopened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on Jan. 29.""The delivery of the State of the Union address had been delayed or substantially changed on only two occasions since 1913.In a letter sent to the Speaker the next day, Trump said she would not be allowed to take military transport aircraft on scheduled visits to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan.Trump replied, ""We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the shutdown is over.""Pelosi and a congressional delegation had planned on visiting overseas American military personnel.\n\nOn January 23, Trump sent a letter to Pelosi insisting that there were no security concerns and that he would hold the State of the Union Address as scheduled.Trump wrote, ""Therefore, I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and Congress of the United States of America regarding the State of our Union.""In a letter sent in reply, Pelosi stated that the House would not consider a concurrent resolution to authorize the State of the Union Address in the House Chamber until the shutdown ended, writing, ""Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened.""\n\nTrump later stated he would look for an alternative, but then retracted that statement in a pair of tweets announcing that he would wait until the end of the shutdown to give the address in the House Chamber.\n\nOn January 25, Trump announced his support for a three-week funding measure that would reopen the government until February 15.The deal, which also moved forward with long-term Department of Homeland Security funding, did not include funds for a wall.As expected, the agreement provided federal employees with back pay.Both the Senate and House of Representatives passed the funding measure by voice vote, sending the resolution to the President\'s desk.Trump signed the bill the same day, ending the shutdown.\n\nLater in January, Republican senators voted unanimously against a bill to provide back pay to federal contractors.\n\nWithout legislation enacted by February 15, a new partial shutdown would have begun, three weeks after the last ended.A bipartisan group of senators and representatives reached an agreement ""in principle"" on February 11, but Trump did not say whether he would sign it.Included was $1.375 billion for 55 miles of steel border fencing.On February 13, it was reported that, against the wishes of Democratic leaders and many Republicans, Trump was blocking the provision of back pay to federal contractors who were still out of pocket from the shutdown.Both houses passed the bill February 14 with enough votes to override a veto if that happened.\n\nOn February 15, at the White House Rose Garden, Trump announced that he had signed the spending bill to keep the government open.He also declared a national emergency, hoping to get access to $8 billion to use for border security.\n\nAgencies funded by two ""minibus"" appropriations bills passed in September 2018 were not affected by the shutdown.About 380,000 federal employees were furloughed, and an additional 420,000 employees for the affected agencies were expected to work with their pay delayed until the end of the shutdown, totaling 800,000 workers affected out of 2.1 million civilian non-postal federal employees.As only about a quarter of the government was shut down, many people who are not federal employees did not fully realize the effects of the shutdown.\n\nAccording to and , these were the affected agencies:\n\nDepartment of State Department of the Treasury Department of Justice Most of the Department of the Interior Department of Agriculture Department of Commerce Department of Housing and Urban Development Department of Transportation Department of Homeland Security Some Department of Health and Human Services agencies Food and Drug Administration Indian Health Service Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Superfund Research Program Executive Office of the President Most independent agencies Judicial Branch\n\nUnaffected agencies include, according to and :\n\nDepartment of Defense Department of Labor Most of the Department of Health and Human Services Department of Energy Department of Education Department of Veterans Affairs Some Department of the Interior agencies Bureau of Reclamation Central Utah Project District of Columbia (excluding courts) Legislative Branch Social Security Administration Nuclear Regulatory Commission Appalachian Regional Commission Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board Delta Regional Authority Denali Commission Northern Border Regional Commission Southeast Crescent Regional Commission Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board American Battle Monuments Commission U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Cemeterial Expenses of the Army, including Arlington National Cemetery and Soldiers\' and Airmen\'s Home National Cemetery Armed Forces Retirement Home Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System Fund Intelligence Community Management Account Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled Corporation for National and Community Service Corporation for Public Broadcasting Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission Institute of Museum and Library Services Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission Medicare Payment Advisory Commission National Council on Disability National Labor Relations Board National Mediation Board Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission Railroad Retirement Board\n\nJobs affected included staff throughout the United States, not just DC area employees.FBI agents, federal corrections officers, FDA inspectors, NASA employees, TSA staff, Border Patrol staff and CBP officers, census staff, National Park Service staff, members of the Coast Guard, and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers either worked without pay or were furloughed, with increasing numbers of unpaid essential employees failing to show up for work.\n\nOn January 11, 800,000 workers for agencies shutdown or furloughed missed their first paycheck.Federal workers normally receive pay on federal holidays, which include Christmas, New Year\'s Day and potentially Martin Luther King Jr. Day.The shutdown affected the employees\' entitlement to paid holidays due to the shutdown.Unemployment assistance to federal workers furloughed under the government shutdown varied by locality.Only non-reporting workers were eligible for assistance, whereas furloughed workers who still reported to work were not.Workers who received unemployment assistance were required pay it back after the shut down ended and they received backpay.Some furloughed workers sought other employment opportunities while they were idled.However, external employment must meet agency-specific ethics guidelines, and mandatory reviews of external employment were also curtailed as most ethics officials were also furloughed.Federal employees were not able to use vacation or sick leave during the shutdown so scheduled holiday vacation time either became unpaid if the worker was deemed non-essential or was cancelled if the worker was deemed essential.In many cases unused leave over a certain threshold expired at year-end, but employees who had leave scheduled in advance of the shutdown did not have ""use or lose"" leave balances deducted from their accrued leave.Many furloughed employees took to crowd-funding campaigns to raise cash to replace missed paychecks, but these types of solicitations also run afoul of government ethics rules.\n\nAs furloughed federal workers and their families shared stories of their hardships, such as not being able to meet rent or mortgage payments and missed bills, the hashtag ""#ShutdownStories"" went viral on social media.The federal government\'s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) responded by publishing sample letters that employees could send to their creditors.One read, in part, ""I am a Federal employee who has recently been furloughed due to a lack of funding of my agency.Because of this, my income has been severely cut and I am unable to pay the entire cost of my mortgage, along with my other expenses.""Other federal workers reached out to other news outlets to share stories about having to stretch their budgets and the impact of the shutdown on their families.In addition to being unable to meet rent or pay bills, many federal workers around the country were unable to pay for groceries and turned to food banks.One federal prison guard in Louisiana attempted suicide after posting about the financial pressures of the shutdown on Facebook.\n\nThe OPM also suggested that employees who had landlords write: ""I would like to discuss with you the possibility of trading my services to perform maintenance (e.g. painting, carpentry work) in exchange for partial rent payments"" and suggested those who lacked funds to pay bills should hire personal attorneys to assist them.Other organizations also posted advice on how to ""find supplemental income""; the Coast Guard suggested that Coast Guard members ""have a garage sale, offer to watch children, walk pets or house sit"" while furloughed.\n\nOn January 4, The Washington Post reported that because the shutdown was triggered by the failure to enact spending bills that continued a federal government pay freeze, hundreds of senior Trump administration political appointees would receive a roughly $10,000 pay raise the following day.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the pending pay raise was an ""unnecessary byproduct of the shutdown.""\n\nOn January 10, the Senate approved by unanimous consent a bill (S.24, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019) providing that furloughed federal employees would receive back pay for the period of the furlough once appropriations were restored; the bill was approved the next day by the House on a vote of 411–7.Trump signed the bill into law on January 16.\n\nNative American tribes were not paid for treaties negotiated with the United States government.These treaties specified that the federal government must provide funding for health clinics, employee salaries, education, infrastructure and other services, which were not paid during the shutdown.Native lands are ""owned, managed and maintained by the federal government.""Native Americans who receive a per capita check for profits from oil and gas sales from tribal land did not receive check for the month of February.Roads were not plowed on tribal land, and some areas received significant snowfall.This caused people of the Navajo Nation to become trapped inside their homes.Food services, which fed 90,000 Native Americans in 2017, were halted.\n\nNative American communities had a high percentage of individuals who worked for the federal government and lost income during the shutdown.In North and South Dakota, one of the largest employers is the Indian Health Service.The Chippewa tribe reported an economic loss of nearly $100,000 daily in funds that the federal government was supposed to provide as a treaty obligation.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was closed for the shutdown.However, 60 percent of the Indian Health Service (IHS) continued to work without pay.IHS provides care for 2.2 million Native Americans and on January 23, began to deny care that was not considered ""life threatening.""The Bureau of Indian Education was able to stay open because it was funded on a different schedule.Unlike other government shutdowns, there was little outreach from the Trump Administration to Native Americans and the Chippewa tribe in Michigan was given a 24-hour notice that the shutdown would take place and affect the tribe.\n\nThe only military branch that was affected by the shutdown was the Coast Guard because it was part of the Department of Homeland Security, while the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps were all funded through the Department of Defense.Officials were able to fund payment on December 31, 2018, but were not able to do so for the paychecks of January 15 and 30, 2019, along with the pay and benefits for civilian workers and retirees.During the shutdown, the Coast Guard continued to engage in patrolling the American coastline and carrying out overseas missions in locations such as the Persian Gulf along with the Navy and in the Caribbean.Other issues arose in the payment processes for Coast Guard members Tricare Health and Dental Program payments, although the individuals were still covered.\n\nMilitary schools, such as the Coast Guard Academy and the National War College, lost funding due to the shutdown and the schools had to work to find funds to pay professors.\n\nAlthough the Department of Defense was not shut down, the February 4, 2019, date for release of the Pentagon\'s 2020 budget was delayed by at least one month.This had repercussions on the interim period which is usually used by Pentagon planners for adjustments before the 2020 fiscal year which will begin in October 2019.The White House Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the Pentagon request, was shut down when the Pentagon budget arrived in December, and remained inactive, so no work was done on the budget.\n\nOn February 25, 2019, the Pentagon\'s counter-drug (interdiction) funding has up to $85 million not yet obligated, but that money was planned for the known corridors in El Paso, Tucson, Yuma, and El Centro for border fencing, lighting, and road projects, so any funds which might possibly be intended for additional projects elsewhere along the border must be obligated by September 30, 2019, in order not to affect the known corridors.Otherwise appropriations above the $85 million not yet obligated for additional interdiction border projects will have to be approved by additional Congressional appropriations, to reach the $2 billion target.\n\nA January 28, 2019 Congressional Budget Office report estimated that the 35-day partial government shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion, including $3 billion in permanent losses; the CBO estimate excluded indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.The furloughing of 145,000 federal workers and 112,500 federal contractors in the Washington Metropolitan Area cost the regional economy $119 million each day, or 7.3% of the region\'s total output.That reduced GDP by over $2.8 billion in the Washington DC area alone.The shutdown also had a noticeable impact on hunger in the national capital region: food pantries in Washington DC and Northern Virginia reported an increase of around 10% in the number of people coming to pick up groceries, with most of that increase coming from federal workers and contractors.\n\nFitch Ratings warned that an extended shutdown might lead to a downgrade in the U.S.\'s Triple-A credit rating if lawmakers were unable to pass a budget or manage the debt ceiling.That in turn would make borrowing more costly for companies and American households, because it is the benchmark for many other lines of credit.The only time the U.S. credit rating has been downgraded by S&P was during the United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011.\n\nSome economists believed that an extended shutdown would weaken consumer confidence and heighten the risk of pushing the U.S. economy into a recession.Between 800,000 federal government employees and some 4 million federal contractors, the shutdown directly affected nearly 3% of the labor force of the United States; in a typical recession, unemployment increases 2–4%.The reduction in spending by those households combined with the reduction of government services could have macroeconomic results similar to a typical recession.The shutdown had an adverse effect on the budgets of state and local governments, as states covered some federal services (particularly the most vulnerable) during the shutdown.\n\nBy mid-January 2019, the White House Council of Economic Advisors estimated that each week of the shutdown reduced GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, the equivalent of 1.2 points per quarter.CEA chairman Kevin Hassett later acknowledged that GDP growth could decline to zero in the first quarter of 2019 if the shutdown lasted the entire quarter.\n\nAs tax season began in the United States on January 28, some 46,000 Internal Revenue Service workers were called back to work to ensure tax refunds and returns were not affected by the shutdown.The recalled workers allowed the department to continue operations that were automatic and those deemed necessary for the safety of human life or protection of government property, such as processing electronic returns, returns with payments, mailing tax forms, appeals, criminal law enforcement investigations and technical support.\n\nDuring the shutdown, 95% of federal staff for the USDA\'s Food and Nutrition Services were furloughed.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the food-stamp program, could be funded through a $3 billion contingency fund appropriated by Congress in 2018; if the shutdown had continued through March 2019, those funds would have been exhausted, leaving some 38 million Americans without food stamps and endangering food security.Concerns were raised that continuation of the shutdown could delay the issuance of some $140 billion in tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees most of the food supply in the U.S.In early January, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner, reported that the FDA suspended food inspections.He noted that inspection of foreign food was continuing as ""almost normal,"" because they are considered vital.Around January 14, ""high-risk"" food inspections resumed.As of January 22, 2019, 46 percent of the FDA were working, though 20 percent of them were working without pay.During the shutdown, two new recalls for contamination with Listeria or Salmonella took place.Consumer advocacy groups advised of food safety issues during the shutdown.Food safety attorney, Bill Marler, advocated against eating ""fresh, uncooked products on the market place.""Because there was a shortage of FDA inspectors, many imported perishable items, such as produce or flowers, were at risk of spoilage.Meat and some egg products are inspected by the USDA\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service.Federal legislation required those inspectors to remain working without pay.\n\nSchool administrations raised concern about how to feed children who purchase food at the schools for lunch, as funding concerns caused some districts to conserve food and funding.Many limited the amount or variation of foods available for the children to purchase, and alerted parents to the concerns and the limited availability of some of the items.Most schools affected were in high-poverty areas, and depended on federally funded lunch programs, such as the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) a federal grant established by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 and operated through the Department of Agriculture.Some 22 million students in nearly 100,000 schools received school meals through that operation.\n\nAs with the January 2018 shutdown, national parks were expected to be open to the extent practical, though there would be no staff and buildings would be closed.The shutdown affected national parks unevenly, some were accessible with bare-bones staffing levels, some operated with money from states or charitable groups, and others were locked off.Diane Regas, president and chief executive of the Trust for Public Land, called upon Trump to close all national parks to protect the public: by the third week of the shutdown, three people had died in national parks.This number was reported as being within \'usual\' levels.At Yosemite National Park, on January 4, 2019, a death from a fall went unreported for a week.\n\nBy January 1, 2019, the problems of neglected trash pileup, overflowing public toilets, and access to first aid were repeated across the Park system.Health and safety concerns were raised, with concerns by scientists that the expansive amount of garbage and human waste could impact water and soil quality, or cause damage to animals in the parks.Other issues that arose due to the shutdown included illegal campsites, protected agriculture being damaged, damaging of government property and trespassing on foot and by vehicle.\n\nNew York kept the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open, as it did during the January 2018 shutdown.Arizona and Utah were able to keep Grand Canyon National Park, Zion National Park, Arches National Park, and Bryce Canyon National Park open and provided services including public restrooms, shuttles and trash collection.Utah\'s funding included visitor centers.The sites closed outright in the southwest alone included Bandelier National Monument and Valles Caldera National Preserve in northern New Mexico, White Sands National Monument in southern New Mexico, Petrified Forest National Park in northern Arizona and Casa Grande Ruins National Monument in south-central Arizona.Access to major parts of Sequoia and Kings Canyon parks were closed, and at Joshua Tree National Park, the administration policy of leaving parks open to visitors despite the staff furloughs resulted in park damage, including the toppling of protected trees.In Texas, Big Bend National Park had no visitor services, such as restrooms.Some trailheads were closed.Regulations continued to be enforced, as the park remained open.Visitors were reminded to remove their own trash and toilet paper.The Alamo remained open but no NPS services were available at the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park.Channel Islands National Park remained open to public access, although services normally provided by the national park service were instead provided by Island Packers Cruises, the company normally in charge of ferries to the islands.\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration closed immediately on December 22, 2018.The Library of Congress, the U.S. Botanic Garden, the Capitol Visitor Center, and the U.S. Capitol Building remained open as they were funded by the 2019 Legislative Branch appropriations bill.The Smithsonian Institution operated on ""prior-year funds"" through January 1, 2019.On January 2, 2019, the Smithsonian Institution initiated an orderly shutdown of all its facilities, including 19 museums in Washington, D.C., and New York City, the National Zoo, and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.The following day, the National Gallery of Art was closed.The National Zoo also closed on January 3, 2019.Tourism attendance on the National Mall was affected.On January 5, 2019, acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt directed the diversion of fee revenue defined by the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to be used to fund minimal maintenance activities so as to preserve access to highly visited parks.\n\nAccording to a January 12, 2019, article in The Economist, on January 11, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was unable to pay its workers who had not been paid since December 22; 55% more of them called in sick than in January 2018.\n\nAs the air traffic controllers were deemed essential employees, they were required to work without pay.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents air traffic controllers, filed a lawsuit against the federal government for the shutdown on January 11, 2019, claiming that requiring 16,000 air traffic controllers to work without being paid violated their constitutional rights and federal minimum wage law.That was the third lawsuit filed against the federal government since the beginning of the shutdown.\n\nAirline and aircraft safety inspectors, on the other hand, were deemed nonessential and furloughed.A news report on January 12, 2019, stated that the Federal Aviation Administration had returned 500 furloughed safety inspectors back to work and would return more to work in the following weeks.As the airline and aircraft safety inspectors were furloughed, the certification process of the Airbus A220 in the US was stalled.Delta Air Lines was forced to delay the launch of the new aircraft, and to use other models of aircraft to serve those routes that was supposed to be served with A220.Many TSA employees also called out sick, most of them because they were trying to find other jobs that would provide immediate paychecks.\n\nThe shutdown initially prevented the National Transportation Safety Board from assisting the Mexican government\'s investigation of the 2018 Puebla helicopter crash that killed a state governor and senator; an exception allowed the NTSB to assist with the Mexican government in the investigation along with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.The NTSB also had to delay several investigations until the government reopened and only continued investigations into accidents that were considered the most serious.Issues in receiving certification and oversight from the FAA led to a month-long delay in the commencement of passenger service at Paine Field in Everett, Washington.\n\nAs the shutdown continued into its fourth week, the unions representing airline pilots, flight attendants and air traffic controllers issued a statement asserting, ""we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play"" because of the shutdown.\n\nSome airports such as the Philadelphia International Airport, launched food and item donations for federal employees who were affected by the shutdown.Other airports such as the Miami International Airport, and the George Bush International Airport, closed down terminals in order to spread out the TSA workers that were available.\n\nOn January 25, flights destined for LaGuardia Airport in New York were halted to a groundstop by FAA officials due to staffing shortages directly as a result of the shutdown.As a result, several flights to and from neighboring airports in the Northeast, specifically Philadelphia and Newark, suffered significant delays of their own.Soon after that, appropriations passed and the government reopened.\n\nThe shutdown delayed software updates to the Boeing 737 MAX airplane which may have caused the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.\n\nDuring the shutdown, court-appointed private lawyers who represent indigent defendants worked without pay.The Federal Judiciary initially had a goal of sustaining paid operations through January 18, 2019.It said it would run out of money to sustain court operations no earlier than January 25, but perhaps as late as February 1.Failing funding, the Judiciary would operate under the terms of the Antideficiency Act.This Act does not allow federal agencies to expend federal funds before an appropriation, nor to accept any voluntary services.The judiciary had 33,000 employees nationwide.Under the Constitution, Supreme Court Justices, appeals court judges and district judges would continue to be paid.\n\nThe shutdown caused many delays and disruptions in cases.Budgets were watched carefully to be able to pay public defenders, DNA testing, informants, and travel costs to interview victims and witnesses.Staffing issues also brought about concerns and constraints with prisons lacking the staff to safely hold attorney-client visits, and caused a delay in bail hearings.\n\nAgents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed in a report released on January 22, 2019, by the FBI Agents Association, that several different investigations were compromised by the shutdown.The report was called ""Voices from the Field"" and was 72 pages long.FBI agents were unable to pay Confidential Human Sources which risks losing that informant permanently.Some FBI divisions no longer have Spanish-speaking staff on hand and could not work with informants who only speak Spanish.Some agents reported that they did not have the funds to assist in joint operations with local law enforcement.\n\nFederal law enforcement agencies working on Native American land worked without pay through the shutdown.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was forced to cancel a trip to the United States/Mexico border in early January due to the shutdown.DHS was also unable to inspect Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities during the shutdown to ensure that immigrants were being held in facilities appropriately.During the shutdown, the federal government\'s e-Verify system—a system for employers to check the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States—was halted.\n\nDuring the shutdown, a wave of Domain Name System (DNS) attacks on government sites was detected by Homeland Security.The attacks were serious because these Internet sites could be hijacked.\n\nOfficial websites for agencies were rendered insecure or inaccessible through the shutdown, as the expired digital certificates were not renewed.On January 23, DHS asked all government agencies to secure their DNS records; however, many agencies were not able to respond quickly to this request.\n\nExecutive and legislative affairs of the local government of the District of Columbia continued operating through the shutdown, due to a provision previously enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017.The District\'s local court system, including the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, are part of the federal judiciary.Thus, they were partially shut down, preventing District residents from accessing services such as marriage licensing.The District of Columbia government said it would take over trash collection and snow plowing operations for National Park Service facilities in Washington.\n\nThe shutdown also interfered with the response to the 2018 Sunda Strait tsunami, as the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta\'s Twitter account was unable to tweet updates, and the United States Geological Survey was unable to provide data on the tsunami.The American weather model, the GFS, suffered a significant drop in forecast quality when a data format change during the shutdown prevented certain weather data from being recognized by the GFS, and the shutdown prevented the bug from being corrected.\n\nBy mid-day Thursday, January 3, 2019, the FCC had suspended operations.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai canceled his trip to the Consumer Electronics Show.The FTC also suspended certain online operations.The EPA and Department of Energy\'s Energy Star website was not available for the duration of the shutdown.\n\nMakers of alcoholic beverages were unable to receive approval from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau for new labels and recipes during the shutdown.\n\nBased on the recalculation of their operating reserves, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) would have had to cease patent operations in the second week of February.A cadre of personnel was allocated to continue receiving patent applications, receive payments, and maintain the IT infrastructure.Even though the USPTO is self-funded, a Congressional appropriation is required to permit the USPTO to spend money.The pipeline of patent applications at the time took 15.8 months for a response from an examiner.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution shortened to two days and downscaled its scheduled ten-day 2019 Folklife Festival on the National Mall because of the shutdown\'s effects.Sabrina Motley, the director of the festival, said that initially, crucial funding for the June—July event arrived later than expected, slowing preparations.Motley stated: ""The government opened back up, but it took a while for systems to come back online. ...We looked at our production schedule, and it became clear we would need more time than we had.""\n\nThe White House residence staff who stage public receptions were among those furloughed, with a minimal staff continuing to work unpaid for the first family.In the midst of the shutdown Trump invited the Clemson Tigers football team to a White House dinner reception on January 14 in recognition of their College Football Playoff National Championship win.On the morning of the reception Trump announced that he intended to serve fast food hamburgers and pizza to the team, a remark that some commentators interpreted as a joke.That evening Trump welcomed the team in the State Dining Room with a buffet of fast food and pizza from McDonald\'s, Wendy\'s and other restaurant chains, which he stated that he had paid for personally.Trump served fast food to other visiting athletes later that year, after the shutdown had ended.\n\nOn January 10, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with several other unions, announced plans to protest the government shutdown at 1:00pm EST in Washington, DC.Leaders of the National Federation of Federal Employees stated they had hoped that bringing federal workers to the President\'s doorstep would show him that it was the individual workers that the shutdown was hurting the most.President Trump had left to visit the US–Mexican border in Texas earlier in the day.\n\nSimilar protests took place in Philadelphia and St. Louis, among other cities.On January 15, representatives for Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, and Vietnam Veterans of America along with others called for an end to shutdown, but avoided placing any blame on political parties.\n\nShortly after the protests, the American Federation of Government Employees sued the Trump administration to challenge the arrangements for work without pay during the shutdown.A similar suit was raised and won during the 2013 Federal Government shutdown.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association also sued the Trump administration, as the shutdown allegedly violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by failing to pay the workers at least a minimum wage during the shutdown.\n\nAs the salaries for members of Congress are written into permanent law and not funded through annual appropriations, the government shutdown did not affect their salaries.Senators and Representatives were still paid their biweekly salaries of $6,700 towards at least $174,000 a year.\n\nSeveral Democratic and Republican Senators and Representatives said they would donate or refuse their salary during the shutdown.Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw stated that he would refuse his salary, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto indicated she would donate hers to a Nevada charity, Senator Mazie Hirono said she would donate her salary to Hawaii food banks, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would give hers to refugee non-profit HIAS, New York Congressman Max Rose stated that he would give his salary to charity and outgoing Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota pledged hers to charity, along with her Republican colleague John Hoeven.Republican senator Kevin Cramer, who defeated Heidi Heitkamp in the 2018 midterm elections, refused to donate his salary, calling the move ""gimmicky"".Representative Brian Fitzpatrick urged all members of Congress to decline their paychecks.He said, ""If you\'re in Congress, don\'t just delay your pay -- forfeit it, write a check back to the US Treasury.Then you\'ll feel the pain of federal workers.""\n\nBy January 17, 2019, 102 members of Congress—20 Senators and 82 Representatives— chose to decline their paychecks or were donating their paychecks to charity.\n\nDuring the shutdown, many federal workers used food banks and food pantries in order to feed themselves and their families.Many food pantries waived certain restrictions in order to help government workers have access to food.During the shutdown, the Salvation Army Emergency Disasters Services program provided meals for federal workers.Chef Jose Andres created the #ChefsForFeds program to feed federal workers in Washington, D.C. and by January 21, made announcements to expand the program nationwide.\n\nSome states such as California, offered furloughed employees unemployment benefits, although the Trump administration allegedly told states that they could not do so with federal funds.Organizations such as state Attorney Generals offices, and credit card companies posted statements to their websites to offer a means to help to consolidate debt, meet mortgages or other payments such as child support or tuition.An employment law firm offered pro bono legal advice to furloughed federal employees.School districts opened up free or reduced lunch options for children of federal employees, and looked into other options to aid parents amid concerns that financial stress at home would adversely affect families and children.Every mainline denomination in America has contributed to efforts to provide relief.One Baptist church emptied its entire disaster fund to aid federal employees.\n\nOn January 24, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross downplayed the financial difficulties faced by the 800,000 federal workers affected by the shutdown, stating that they should borrow money to ""tide them over"" until the shutdown ends.Critics and Democrats criticized the statement as inappropriate, noting that Ross\' own net worth is estimated at almost $700 million, accusing him of being out of touch with the workers.Ross also said that he ""did not understand"" why people who were not getting paid due to the shutdown were visiting food banks.When asked about Ross\' statement, Trump suggested that grocery stores will ""work along"" with the government by voluntarily extending credit to those who are out of funds to buy food.National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow characterized the shutdown as a ""glitch"" and suggested that federal workers who were required to work without pay were ""volunteering"" to work for their love of the country and ""presumably their allegiance to President Trump.""\n\nIn a video message to staff, FBI director Christopher Wray stated, ""Making some people stay home when they don\'t want to, and making others show up without pay, it\'s mind-boggling, it\'s shortsighted and it\'s unfair.It takes a lot to get me angry, but I\'m about as angry as I\'ve been in a long, long time.""\n\nLara Trump, a daughter-in-law of the President, drew outrage after an interview in which she stated that while ""It\'s not fair to you..."" the shutdown was ""...a little bit of pain, but it\'s going to be for the future of our country, and their children and their grandchildren and generations after them will thank them for their sacrifice right now.""Her comments drew criticism by politicians, celebrities, and the general public who felt the advisor and spokeswoman for the Trump 2020 campaign was out of touch, however Lara Trump later claimed the comments were taken out of context.\n\nIn January 2019, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that 56% of the responding public opposed a wall while 39% favored it, and 45% viewed the situation at the border as a crisis.The numbers were similar to the poll in December 2018 yet a later poll by ABC News showed that as the partial shutdown entered its fourth week support for building a wall was increasing.A poll done through YouGov between December 23–25, 2018, reported that 51% of respondents thought Trump deserved ""a lot"" of the blame, 44% thought congressional Democrats and 39% thought congressional Republicans.Similar results were reported by a December 21–25 survey done by Reuters and Ipsos in which 47% of respondents said that the shutdown was the President\'s fault and 33% blamed Congressional Democrats.\n\nOver the course of the shutdown, Trump\'s approval rating marginally declined while his disapproval rating marginally increased.His net approval rating was by the middle of January 2019 at its lowest point since February 2018.On December 27, 2018, it was reported that Trump\'s approval rating of registered voters was at 39%, with 56% disapproval.Broken down the rating was split across party lines, with Republicans reporting an 80% approval rate while Democrats and independents reported a 90% and 57% disapproval rating, respectively.The poll was conducted through Morning Consult between December 21–23.The poll also reported that 43% of respondents blamed Trump for the shutdown, with 31% blaming congressional Democrats and 7% congressional Republicans.Another poll through The New York Times Upshot/Siena College reported that 89% of voters\' views on Trump and the wall were aligned, suggesting that support for the wall was a function of support for Trump.\n\nThe Washington Post–ABC News poll published on January 13, 2019, found that a larger number of Americans blamed Trump and congressional Republicans than congressional Democrats for the shutdown.A PBS NewsHour–Marist poll found that on January 15, 2019, a majority of Americans thought that President Trump was to blame for the shutdown.A January 2019 poll conducted by telephone for CBS News found that 70% of Americans polled did not want a government shutdown over the issue of building a border wall; 66% believed that Trump should agree to a budget without wall funding.\n\nPresidency of Donald Trump Donald Trump January 2018 United

54,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018–2019 United States federal government shutdown', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The United States federal government shutdown from midnight EST on December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019 (35 days) was the longest government shutdown in history and the second and final federal government shutdown involving furloughs during the presidency of Donald Trump.It occurred when the 115th Congress and Trump could not agree on an appropriations bill to fund the operations of the federal government for the 2019 fiscal year, or a temporary continuing resolution that would extend the deadline for passing a bill.The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal departments or agencies from conducting non-essential operations without appropriations legislation in place.As a result, nine executive departments with around 800,000 employees had to shut down partially or in full, affecting about one-fourth of government activities and causing employees to be furloughed or required to work without being paid.The Congressional Budget Office estimated the shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion USD, excluding indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.\n\nThe shutdown stemmed from an impasse over Trump\'s demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall.In December 2018, the Senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the bill appeared likely to be approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Trump.After Trump faced heavy criticism from some right-wing media outlets and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to ""build the wall"", he announced that he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund its construction.As a result, the House passed a stopgap bill with funding for the wall, but it was blocked in the Senate by the threat of a Democratic filibuster.\n\nIn January 2019, representatives elected in the November 2018 election took office, giving the Democrats a majority in the House.The House immediately voted to approve the appropriations bill that had previously passed the Senate unanimously (which included no funding for the wall).For several weeks, Trump continued to maintain that he would veto any bill that did not fund an entire border wall, and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the Senate from considering any appropriations legislation that Trump would not support, including the bill that had previously passed.Democrats and some Republicans opposed the shutdown and passed multiple bills to reopen the government, arguing that the government shutdown amounted to ""hostage-taking"" civil servants and that negotiations could only begin once the government was reopened.\n\nOn January 25, 2019, Trump agreed to endorse a stopgap bill to reopen the government for three weeks up until February 15 to allow for negotiations to take place to approve an appropriations bill that both parties could agree on.However, Trump reiterated his demand for the border wall funding and said that he would shut down the government again or declare a national emergency and use military funding to build the wall if Congress did not appropriate the funds by February 15.\n\nTrump\'s approval rating dropped during the shutdown.A majority of Americans opposed exploitation of the shutdown as a negotiating strategy and held Trump responsible for the shutdown: A CBS News poll found that 71% of Americans considered the border wall ""not worth the shutdown"" and a Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 53% of Americans blamed Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, compared to 34% who blamed Democrats and 10% who blamed both parties.\n\nOn February 15, 2019, Trump declared a national emergency to fund the wall and bypass Congress, after being unsatisfied with a bipartisan border bill that had passed the House and the Senate a day before.\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign, then-candidate Trump promised to build a wall along the Mexico–United States border for which Mexico would pay.The president of Mexico rejected the idea of providing any funding for a U.S. border wall.In 2018, Trump requested $ in federal funding for some of barrier on the border, mostly to replace of aging fence built under the Secure Fence Act of 2006.On December 25, 2018, Trump reversed course, suggesting that he might accept of either mostly refurbished barrier (rather than new barriers in locations that did not previously have them) by November 2020.Trump\'s proposals and public statements on the wall have shifted widely over time, with varied proposals as to the design, material, length, height, and width of a wall.\n\nIn September 2018, Congress passed two ""minibus"" appropriations bills for the 2019 United States federal budget, which began on October 1, 2018.These bills combined five of the 12 regular appropriations bills covering 77% of federal discretionary funding, and included a continuing resolution until December 7 for the remaining agencies.On December 6, Congress passed a second continuing resolution to December 21, to give more time for negotiations on Trump\'s proposed border wall, which had been delayed due to the funeral of George H. W. Bush.\n\nA Senate Homeland Security appropriations bill, negotiated by both parties and reported by the committee to the Senate, provided for $ for border security, including funds for ""approximately 65 miles of pedestrian fencing along the southwest border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector"".The bill did not receive a vote on the Senate floor, although House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer indicated that such a proposal could be acceptable to House Democrats.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said the Democratic Party would not support $ for the border wall.At a press conference before the government shutdown, he noted ""the $1.6 billion for border security negotiated by Democrats and Republicans is our position.We believe that is the right way to go.""\n\nOn December 11, President Trump held a televised meeting with Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in the Oval Office and asked them to support an appropriation of $5.7 billion for funding of a border wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico.They refused, resulting in an argument between Trump and both Congressional leaders.During the contentious discussion, Trump remarked, ""I am proud to shut down the government for border security ...I will be the one to shut [the government] down.I\'m not going to blame you for it ...I will take the mantle.I will be the one to shut it down.""Schumer replied, ""We shouldn\'t shut down the government over a dispute.""Ten days later, Trump blamed Democrats for the impending shutdown.\n\nThree days later, Politico reported that Trump was willing to sign a bill with no funding for a border wall that delayed a government shutdown into 2019 and the new Congress.On December 18, following a meeting with Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the government would not shut down on December 22 and that Trump was ""flexible"" over funding for a border wall.Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby commented that the most likely resolution was a bill that funded the government until early February.Schumer added that his caucus would ""very seriously"" consider such a bill and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said ""I don\'t know anybody on the Hill that wants a shutdown, and I think all the president\'s advisers are telling him this would not be good.""\n\nOn December 19, the Senate passed a second continuing resolution () that would fund the government until February 8, 2019.Pelosi announced that House Democrats would support the measure, meaning it would overcome opposition from conservative Republicans and pass the House.On December 20, following increased criticism from conservative media, pundits, and political figures, Trump reversed his position and declared that he would not sign any funding bill that did not include border wall funding.The same day, the House passed a continuing resolution that included $5 billion for the wall and $8 billion in disaster aid.This bill failed in the Senate.Trump\'s changing position caused consternation among Senate Republicans.\n\nThe shutdown started December 22 and Trump announced that he would cancel his planned trip to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas and stay in Washington, D.C.The meaning of the term ""wall"" was expected to be an aspect of the negotiations.\n\nCongress adjourned on December 22 for the Christmas and holiday season, with many predicting that the shutdown would not be resolved until the start of the 116th Congress.The Senate reconvened on December 27 for four minutes, with Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) presiding over the session.The House briefly reconvened as well, with Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) saying that members should not expect any further votes for the rest of 2018.Representative Jim McGovern (D-MA) went to the House floor to try to force consideration of a short-term funding bill to end the shutdown that the Senate had already passed, but the Republican Speaker-pro-tem refused to let him speak.\n\nCongress then adjourned again until December 31, 2018, for a pro forma session.On January 2, 2019, the last full day of the 115th United States Congress, there was a pro forma session scheduled to last several minutes.\n\nThe new Congress was sworn in on January 3, 2019, and one of the first orders of business in the House after electing the Speaker and swearing in the new members was a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security until February 8 (), which passed by a vote of 239–192; and a package combining five appropriation bills funding the rest of the government for the remainder of the fiscal year (), passed by a vote of 241–190.The bills contained $1.3 billion of funding for border security, but no additional funding for a border wall.\n\nBeginning on January 9, the Democratic-controlled House voted on four appropriations bills individually:\n\nFinancial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Treasury (including the Internal Revenue Service), federal judiciary, District of Columbia, and a number of independent agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, General Services Administration, and Securities and Exchange Commission.The House passed the legislation on January 9, on a 240–188 vote, with every Democrat and eight Republicans voting yes, and all other Republicans voting no. Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Department of Agriculture (including food stamps), the Food and Drug Administration, and related entities.On January 10, the House passed this bill 243–183.Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore Transportation and Housing and Urban Development (including some federal mortgage programs).On January 10, the House passed this bill 244–180.Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Interior Department, Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies, including the Smithsonian Institution.On January 11, ten House Republicans voted with Democrats in a 240–179 vote to end the shutdown of Interior-Environment programs.It was the most recent of a ""series of standalone appropriations measures"" the House sent to the Senate.\n\nThis strategy has been compared to one used by Republicans during the 2013 shutdown in the form of a series of fourteen mini-continuing resolutions.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed that the Senate would not consider the House bills to reopen the government, indicating that Senate Republicans would not support any bill unless it had Trump\'s support.In January 2019, McConnell and Senate Republicans came under increased pressure to break the impasse and reopen the government.Three Republican Senators—Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Cory Gardner of Colorado—called for an end to the shutdown.Senators Collins and Gardner said they supported the House\'s budget bills to end the shutdown.West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito said that she could support ending the shutdown provided border wall talks continued.Pat Roberts of Kansas said that shutdowns ""never work"" and only turned affected federal workers into ""pawns"" and that, although the time had not yet come for Senate Republicans to override any possible Trump veto and end the shutdown, ""we\'re getting pretty close.""Johnny Isakson of Georgia echoed that sentiment, saying that support for McConnell\'s refusal to support bills that do not include funding for a wall would not last indefinitely: ""There\'s a time when that may run out.""\n\nOn January 16, McConnell again blocked the House appropriation bills to reopen the government from being considered on the Senate floor.The following day, McConnell blocked consideration of bills to reopen most of the closed government agencies for a third time.On January 23, McConnell blocked a bill to reopen most of the government for the fourth time.\n\nOn January 22, McConnell stated that the Senate would be voting on two different bills to end the shutdown on January 24.The first vote is on a bill to reopen the government which includes Trump\'s proposal to provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and temporary protections to some immigration classes.The other bill is a three-week continuing resolution to fund 25% of the government through February 8.\n\nOn January 22, Senator Mark Warner introduced a bill to keep the federal government running in the event of future shutdown events.The bill is called the ""Stop Shutdowns Transferring Unnecessary Pain and Inflicting Damage in the Coming Years Act"" or the ""Stop STUPIDITY Act"".\n\nOn January 24, the Senate held two votes on competing Democratic and Republican proposals to end the shutdown.The Democratic proposal was largely similar to the measure that had previously passed the Senate unanimously in the 115th Congress, and then been passed by the Democratic-controlled House in the 116th Congress.It provided funding for the government with no money for the border wall.The Republican proposal incorporated Trump\'s proposal, which would fund a border wall; temporarily extend TPS and DACA for three years, but would substantially narrow eligibility for DACA; and make significant legal changes to make it more difficult for persons escaping violence and persecution to be granted asylum in the United States.Neither proposal was able to attain the 60 votes needed for passage.The Trump plan failed in a 50–47 vote.The Democratic plan failed in a 52–44 vote.Most Republicans voted for Trump\'s plan and against the Democratic plan.Most Democrats voted for the Democratic plan and against Trump\'s plan.Republicans Tom Cotton and Mike Lee voted against both plans.Democrat Joe Manchin and Republicans Lamar Alexander, Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, Johnny Isakson, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney voted for both plans.Not voting on either were Republicans Rand Paul and Jim Risch and Democrat Jacky Rosen.Republican Richard Burr voted for Trump\'s plan and did not vote on the Democratic plan.\n\nOn January 25, House Democrats prepared a compromise proposal to reopen the government, which would provide $5 billion for border security but no wall construction.However, the shutdown ended the same day.\n\nOn January 4, after the new Congress was sworn-in and Pelosi regained the speakership, she and Schumer, as well as congressional Republican leadership met with Trump at the White House.Pelosi and Schumer argued that the shutdown needed to end and reported that Trump refused.They said that Trump threatened to ""keep the government closed for a very long period of time.Months or even years.""Later that day, Trump admitted to ""absolutely"" making that threat, adding, ""I\'m very proud of doing what I\'m doing.""Trump then said that he was considering declaring a national emergency to use military funding for the wall.At the meeting, Trump reprimanded his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney for attempting to propose a compromise between Trump\'s $5.7 billion demand for a border wall and the Democrats\' proposal of $1.3 billion for border security.\n\nTrump addressed the nation from the Oval Office at 9 p.m. EST on January 8, in a nationally televised address broadcast on both network and cable television.In his speech, Trump asserted that there was a ""growing humanitarian and security crisis"" on the Mexico–United States border that could only be solved by appropriating $5.7 billion for construction of a steel wall.Trump did not make any new proposals in his speech to break the impasse.Immediately after Trump\'s speech, Schumer and Pelosi delivered a response on behalf of the Democrats, in which they demanded an end to the shutdown and said: ""President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government.""\n\nTrump met with congressional leadership again on January 9, in a meeting lasting 14 minutes.Trump asked Pelosi, ""Will you agree to my wall?"" and when she replied that she would not, Trump said ""bye-bye"" and walked out of the meeting, later declaring it ""a total waste of time"".Schumer accused Trump of throwing a ""temper tantrum"" and slamming his hands on the table.Trump rebuked Schumer\'s comments on Twitter.Vice President Mike Pence and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that Trump remained calm and never raised his voice.On January 10, Pelosi described the preceding day\'s meeting with Trump as ""a setup"" staged by White House aides so that Trump could walk out of the meeting.Pelosi described Trump as ""un-presidential""; accused him of ""exploiting this situation in a way that enhances his power""; and said: ""I don\'t think he really wants a solution.I think he loves the distraction.""\n\nAfter Trump walked out of the January 9 meeting with congressional Democratic leaders, no further negotiations were conducted.Several Republican senators met in the office of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, after the meeting to discuss a compromise to end the shutdown.They discussed agreeing to Trump\'s demand for border wall funding and offering the Democrats help for Dreamers, refugee protections and extensions to H-2B visas.On January 13, Graham proposed that Trump agree to a congressional vote to reopen the government pending the resumption of negotiations.Graham suggested that if Trump and congressional Democrats did not come to an agreement at that time, Trump could declare a national emergency.Trump rejected this proposal the next day.\n\nOn January 19, Trump proposed a temporary extension of the two programs that protect about 700,000 immigrants from deportation—Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)—in exchange for funding for the border wall.The protections would be temporary, with no path to citizenship.Trump had previously revoked TPS for people from a number of Latin American and African countries, and taken steps to rescind DACA.In his remarks at the White House, Trump referred to a ""barrier"" rather than a ""wall"" and indicated that he aimed to erect ""steel barriers in high priority locations"" rather than ""a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea.""\n\nIn addition to funding a border wall, the 1,300-page Republican bill released after Trump made his proposal would make major changes to U.S. immigration policy (which were not included in Trump\'s public announcement).The legislation would severely restrict the ability of children from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to apply for asylum in the United States.Specifically, participation in the Central American Minors Program would be subject to an annual cap and migrant children would be barred from applying for asylum in person at the border, and only migrant children with a ""qualified"" parent in the U.S. would be eligible to apply.The bill would also create a new, more burdensome application process for TPS holders, and would exclude TPS holders from Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen.The American Immigration Lawyers Association government relations director said that the proposal ""would categorically block tens of thousands of children from ever applying for asylum,"" while a Cato Institute immigration analyst wrote that the proposal would not extend DACA, but rather replace it with ""a totally different program that will exclude untold thousands of Dreamers who would have been eligible under DACA.""\n\nDemocrats rejected Trump\'s proposal.In a speech on the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""The president\'s proposal is one-sided, harshly partisan and was made in bad faith.The asylum changes are a poison pill, if there ever was one.""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said extending the DACA proposal temporarily was ""unacceptable"" and a ""non-starter"" because it did not ""represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people\'s lives.""Analysts pointed out that Trump had previously rejected a deal that would have provided funding for the border wall in exchange for further protection for DACA recipients.Conversely, Republicans reacted positively to Trump\'s proposal, and Mitch McConnell said he would bring it to a vote in the Senate.\n\nDuring the shutdown, on January 8 in a press conference, a reporter asked Trump if he was considering declaring a national emergency, to which Trump replied, ""I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want"" and suggested that he could declare an emergency.After this, Trump repeatedly threatened to declare a national emergency to unilaterally order wall construction without congressional authorization.Some of Trump\'s advisors, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, reportedly attempted to dissuade him from doing so.Administration officials considered diverting hurricane-relief and wildfire-relief funds from a $13.9 billion February 2018 emergency supplemental appropriations bill (for disaster relief in Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California, among other places) in order to fund a wall, and directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to look into this possibility.\n\nAn attempt by Trump to invoke emergency powers would almost certainly have prompted a lengthy legal challenge in court.Democrats responded that Trump lacked the authority to declare a national emergency; Representative Adam Schiff called it a ""non-starter"" and said that ""if Harry Truman couldn\'t nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this President doesn\'t have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion dollar wall on the border.""Democratic Representative Nydia Velázquez said the notion of redirecting disaster-relief funds to a border wall was ""beyond appalling"".Presidents have declared emergencies in the past, but none has ""involved funding a policy goal after failing to win congressional approval"".Yale Law School professor Bruce Ackerman wrote that the declaration of a national emergency to build a wall as Trump suggested would be unconstitutional and illegal.Other scholars, such as Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice, believed that Trump could make a colorable argument that diverting military-construction appropriations for border-wall construction was legal, but that doing so would be an abuse of power.Law professor Ilya Somin stated that in the unlikely case that Trump succeeded in using the emergency powers in this way, it would set a dangerous precedent, which Republicans would come to regret next time the president was a Democrat.\n\nOn January 11, Trump—while maintaining he has the authority to do so anytime—said he was not in any rush to declare a national emergency to secure wall funding, saying he would rather see Congress ""do its job"" and that the Democrats ""should come back and vote.""The next day he again threatened to use emergency powers if Democrats did not ""come to their senses.""\n\nOn January 16, Pelosi sent a letter to Trump that indicated the House would be unavailable for the 2019 State of the Union Address that was scheduled for January 29.Pelosi wrote, ""Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government reopens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has reopened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on Jan. 29.""The delivery of the State of the Union address had been delayed or substantially changed on only two occasions since 1913.In a letter sent to the Speaker the next day, Trump said she would not be allowed to take military transport aircraft on scheduled visits to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan.Trump replied, ""We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the shutdown is over.""Pelosi and a congressional delegation had planned on visiting overseas American military personnel.\n\nOn January 23, Trump sent a letter to Pelosi insisting that there were no security concerns and that he would hold the State of the Union Address as scheduled.Trump wrote, ""Therefore, I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and Congress of the United States of America regarding the State of our Union.""In a letter sent in reply, Pelosi stated that the House would not consider a concurrent resolution to authorize the State of the Union Address in the House Chamber until the shutdown ended, writing, ""Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened.""\n\nTrump later stated he would look for an alternative, but then retracted that statement in a pair of tweets announcing that he would wait until the end of the shutdown to give the address in the House Chamber.\n\nOn January 25, Trump announced his support for a three-week funding measure that would reopen the government until February 15.The deal, which also moved forward with long-term Department of Homeland Security funding, did not include funds for a wall.As expected, the agreement provided federal employees with back pay.Both the Senate and House of Representatives passed the funding measure by voice vote, sending the resolution to the President\'s desk.Trump signed the bill the same day, ending the shutdown.\n\nLater in January, Republican senators voted unanimously against a bill to provide back pay to federal contractors.\n\nWithout legislation enacted by February 15, a new partial shutdown would have begun, three weeks after the last ended.A bipartisan group of senators and representatives reached an agreement ""in principle"" on February 11, but Trump did not say whether he would sign it.Included was $1.375 billion for 55 miles of steel border fencing.On February 13, it was reported that, against the wishes of Democratic leaders and many Republicans, Trump was blocking the provision of back pay to federal contractors who were still out of pocket from the shutdown.Both houses passed the bill February 14 with enough votes to override a veto if that happened.\n\nOn February 15, at the White House Rose Garden, Trump announced that he had signed the spending bill to keep the government open.He also declared a national emergency, hoping to get access to $8 billion to use for border security.\n\nAgencies funded by two ""minibus"" appropriations bills passed in September 2018 were not affected by the shutdown.About 380,000 federal employees were furloughed, and an additional 420,000 employees for the affected agencies were expected to work with their pay delayed until the end of the shutdown, totaling 800,000 workers affected out of 2.1 million civilian non-postal federal employees.As only about a quarter of the government was shut down, many people who are not federal employees did not fully realize the effects of the shutdown.\n\nAccording to and , these were the affected agencies:\n\nDepartment of State Department of the Treasury Department of Justice Most of the Department of the Interior Department of Agriculture Department of Commerce Department of Housing and Urban Development Department of Transportation Department of Homeland Security Some Department of Health and Human Services agencies Food and Drug Administration Indian Health Service Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Superfund Research Program Executive Office of the President Most independent agencies Judicial Branch\n\nUnaffected agencies include, according to and :\n\nDepartment of Defense Department of Labor Most of the Department of Health and Human Services Department of Energy Department of Education Department of Veterans Affairs Some Department of the Interior agencies Bureau of Reclamation Central Utah Project District of Columbia (excluding courts) Legislative Branch Social Security Administration Nuclear Regulatory Commission Appalachian Regional Commission Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board Delta Regional Authority Denali Commission Northern Border Regional Commission Southeast Crescent Regional Commission Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board American Battle Monuments Commission U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Cemeterial Expenses of the Army, including Arlington National Cemetery and Soldiers\' and Airmen\'s Home National Cemetery Armed Forces Retirement Home Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System Fund Intelligence Community Management Account Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled Corporation for National and Community Service Corporation for Public Broadcasting Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission Institute of Museum and Library Services Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission Medicare Payment Advisory Commission National Council on Disability National Labor Relations Board National Mediation Board Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission Railroad Retirement Board\n\nJobs affected included staff throughout the United States, not just DC area employees.FBI agents, federal corrections officers, FDA inspectors, NASA employees, TSA staff, Border Patrol staff and CBP officers, census staff, National Park Service staff, members of the Coast Guard, and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers either worked without pay or were furloughed, with increasing numbers of unpaid essential employees failing to show up for work.\n\nOn January 11, 800,000 workers for agencies shutdown or furloughed missed their first paycheck.Federal workers normally receive pay on federal holidays, which include Christmas, New Year\'s Day and potentially Martin Luther King Jr. Day.The shutdown affected the employees\' entitlement to paid holidays due to the shutdown.Unemployment assistance to federal workers furloughed under the government shutdown varied by locality.Only non-reporting workers were eligible for assistance, whereas furloughed workers who still reported to work were not.Workers who received unemployment assistance were required pay it back after the shut down ended and they received backpay.Some furloughed workers sought other employment opportunities while they were idled.However, external employment must meet agency-specific ethics guidelines, and mandatory reviews of external employment were also curtailed as most ethics officials were also furloughed.Federal employees were not able to use vacation or sick leave during the shutdown so scheduled holiday vacation time either became unpaid if the worker was deemed non-essential or was cancelled if the worker was deemed essential.In many cases unused leave over a certain threshold expired at year-end, but employees who had leave scheduled in advance of the shutdown did not have ""use or lose"" leave balances deducted from their accrued leave.Many furloughed employees took to crowd-funding campaigns to raise cash to replace missed paychecks, but these types of solicitations also run afoul of government ethics rules.\n\nAs furloughed federal workers and their families shared stories of their hardships, such as not being able to meet rent or mortgage payments and missed bills, the hashtag ""#ShutdownStories"" went viral on social media.The federal government\'s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) responded by publishing sample letters that employees could send to their creditors.One read, in part, ""I am a Federal employee who has recently been furloughed due to a lack of funding of my agency.Because of this, my income has been severely cut and I am unable to pay the entire cost of my mortgage, along with my other expenses.""Other federal workers reached out to other news outlets to share stories about having to stretch their budgets and the impact of the shutdown on their families.In addition to being unable to meet rent or pay bills, many federal workers around the country were unable to pay for groceries and turned to food banks.One federal prison guard in Louisiana attempted suicide after posting about the financial pressures of the shutdown on Facebook.\n\nThe OPM also suggested that employees who had landlords write: ""I would like to discuss with you the possibility of trading my services to perform maintenance (e.g. painting, carpentry work) in exchange for partial rent payments"" and suggested those who lacked funds to pay bills should hire personal attorneys to assist them.Other organizations also posted advice on how to ""find supplemental income""; the Coast Guard suggested that Coast Guard members ""have a garage sale, offer to watch children, walk pets or house sit"" while furloughed.\n\nOn January 4, The Washington Post reported that because the shutdown was triggered by the failure to enact spending bills that continued a federal government pay freeze, hundreds of senior Trump administration political appointees would receive a roughly $10,000 pay raise the following day.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the pending pay raise was an ""unnecessary byproduct of the shutdown.""\n\nOn January 10, the Senate approved by unanimous consent a bill (S.24, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019) providing that furloughed federal employees would receive back pay for the period of the furlough once appropriations were restored; the bill was approved the next day by the House on a vote of 411–7.Trump signed the bill into law on January 16.\n\nNative American tribes were not paid for treaties negotiated with the United States government.These treaties specified that the federal government must provide funding for health clinics, employee salaries, education, infrastructure and other services, which were not paid during the shutdown.Native lands are ""owned, managed and maintained by the federal government.""Native Americans who receive a per capita check for profits from oil and gas sales from tribal land did not receive check for the month of February.Roads were not plowed on tribal land, and some areas received significant snowfall.This caused people of the Navajo Nation to become trapped inside their homes.Food services, which fed 90,000 Native Americans in 2017, were halted.\n\nNative American communities had a high percentage of individuals who worked for the federal government and lost income during the shutdown.In North and South Dakota, one of the largest employers is the Indian Health Service.The Chippewa tribe reported an economic loss of nearly $100,000 daily in funds that the federal government was supposed to provide as a treaty obligation.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was closed for the shutdown.However, 60 percent of the Indian Health Service (IHS) continued to work without pay.IHS provides care for 2.2 million Native Americans and on January 23, began to deny care that was not considered ""life threatening.""The Bureau of Indian Education was able to stay open because it was funded on a different schedule.Unlike other government shutdowns, there was little outreach from the Trump Administration to Native Americans and the Chippewa tribe in Michigan was given a 24-hour notice that the shutdown would take place and affect the tribe.\n\nThe only military branch that was affected by the shutdown was the Coast Guard because it was part of the Department of Homeland Security, while the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps were all funded through the Department of Defense.Officials were able to fund payment on December 31, 2018, but were not able to do so for the paychecks of January 15 and 30, 2019, along with the pay and benefits for civilian workers and retirees.During the shutdown, the Coast Guard continued to engage in patrolling the American coastline and carrying out overseas missions in locations such as the Persian Gulf along with the Navy and in the Caribbean.Other issues arose in the payment processes for Coast Guard members Tricare Health and Dental Program payments, although the individuals were still covered.\n\nMilitary schools, such as the Coast Guard Academy and the National War College, lost funding due to the shutdown and the schools had to work to find funds to pay professors.\n\nAlthough the Department of Defense was not shut down, the February 4, 2019, date for release of the Pentagon\'s 2020 budget was delayed by at least one month.This had repercussions on the interim period which is usually used by Pentagon planners for adjustments before the 2020 fiscal year which will begin in October 2019.The White House Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the Pentagon request, was shut down when the Pentagon budget arrived in December, and remained inactive, so no work was done on the budget.\n\nOn February 25, 2019, the Pentagon\'s counter-drug (interdiction) funding has up to $85 million not yet obligated, but that money was planned for the known corridors in El Paso, Tucson, Yuma, and El Centro for border fencing, lighting, and road projects, so any funds which might possibly be intended for additional projects elsewhere along the border must be obligated by September 30, 2019, in order not to affect the known corridors.Otherwise appropriations above the $85 million not yet obligated for additional interdiction border projects will have to be approved by additional Congressional appropriations, to reach the $2 billion target.\n\nA January 28, 2019 Congressional Budget Office report estimated that the 35-day partial government shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion, including $3 billion in permanent losses; the CBO estimate excluded indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.The furloughing of 145,000 federal workers and 112,500 federal contractors in the Washington Metropolitan Area cost the regional economy $119 million each day, or 7.3% of the region\'s total output.That reduced GDP by over $2.8 billion in the Washington DC area alone.The shutdown also had a noticeable impact on hunger in the national capital region: food pantries in Washington DC and Northern Virginia reported an increase of around 10% in the number of people coming to pick up groceries, with most of that increase coming from federal workers and contractors.\n\nFitch Ratings warned that an extended shutdown might lead to a downgrade in the U.S.\'s Triple-A credit rating if lawmakers were unable to pass a budget or manage the debt ceiling.That in turn would make borrowing more costly for companies and American households, because it is the benchmark for many other lines of credit.The only time the U.S. credit rating has been downgraded by S&P was during the United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011.\n\nSome economists believed that an extended shutdown would weaken consumer confidence and heighten the risk of pushing the U.S. economy into a recession.Between 800,000 federal government employees and some 4 million federal contractors, the shutdown directly affected nearly 3% of the labor force of the United States; in a typical recession, unemployment increases 2–4%.The reduction in spending by those households combined with the reduction of government services could have macroeconomic results similar to a typical recession.The shutdown had an adverse effect on the budgets of state and local governments, as states covered some federal services (particularly the most vulnerable) during the shutdown.\n\nBy mid-January 2019, the White House Council of Economic Advisors estimated that each week of the shutdown reduced GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, the equivalent of 1.2 points per quarter.CEA chairman Kevin Hassett later acknowledged that GDP growth could decline to zero in the first quarter of 2019 if the shutdown lasted the entire quarter.\n\nAs tax season began in the United States on January 28, some 46,000 Internal Revenue Service workers were called back to work to ensure tax refunds and returns were not affected by the shutdown.The recalled workers allowed the department to continue operations that were automatic and those deemed necessary for the safety of human life or protection of government property, such as processing electronic returns, returns with payments, mailing tax forms, appeals, criminal law enforcement investigations and technical support.\n\nDuring the shutdown, 95% of federal staff for the USDA\'s Food and Nutrition Services were furloughed.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the food-stamp program, could be funded through a $3 billion contingency fund appropriated by Congress in 2018; if the shutdown had continued through March 2019, those funds would have been exhausted, leaving some 38 million Americans without food stamps and endangering food security.Concerns were raised that continuation of the shutdown could delay the issuance of some $140 billion in tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees most of the food supply in the U.S.In early January, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner, reported that the FDA suspended food inspections.He noted that inspection of foreign food was continuing as ""almost normal,"" because they are considered vital.Around January 14, ""high-risk"" food inspections resumed.As of January 22, 2019, 46 percent of the FDA were working, though 20 percent of them were working without pay.During the shutdown, two new recalls for contamination with Listeria or Salmonella took place.Consumer advocacy groups advised of food safety issues during the shutdown.Food safety attorney, Bill Marler, advocated against eating ""fresh, uncooked products on the market place.""Because there was a shortage of FDA inspectors, many imported perishable items, such as produce or flowers, were at risk of spoilage.Meat and some egg products are inspected by the USDA\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service.Federal legislation required those inspectors to remain working without pay.\n\nSchool administrations raised concern about how to feed children who purchase food at the schools for lunch, as funding concerns caused some districts to conserve food and funding.Many limited the amount or variation of foods available for the children to purchase, and alerted parents to the concerns and the limited availability of some of the items.Most schools affected were in high-poverty areas, and depended on federally funded lunch programs, such as the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) a federal grant established by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 and operated through the Department of Agriculture.Some 22 million students in nearly 100,000 schools received school meals through that operation.\n\nAs with the January 2018 shutdown, national parks were expected to be open to the extent practical, though there would be no staff and buildings would be closed.The shutdown affected national parks unevenly, some were accessible with bare-bones staffing levels, some operated with money from states or charitable groups, and others were locked off.Diane Regas, president and chief executive of the Trust for Public Land, called upon Trump to close all national parks to protect the public: by the third week of the shutdown, three people had died in national parks.This number was reported as being within \'usual\' levels.At Yosemite National Park, on January 4, 2019, a death from a fall went unreported for a week.\n\nBy January 1, 2019, the problems of neglected trash pileup, overflowing public toilets, and access to first aid were repeated across the Park system.Health and safety concerns were raised, with concerns by scientists that the expansive amount of garbage and human waste could impact water and soil quality, or cause damage to animals in the parks.Other issues that arose due to the shutdown included illegal campsites, protected agriculture being damaged, damaging of government property and trespassing on foot and by vehicle.\n\nNew York kept the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open, as it did during the January 2018 shutdown.Arizona and Utah were able to keep Grand Canyon National Park, Zion National Park, Arches National Park, and Bryce Canyon National Park open and provided services including public restrooms, shuttles and trash collection.Utah\'s funding included visitor centers.The sites closed outright in the southwest alone included Bandelier National Monument and Valles Caldera National Preserve in northern New Mexico, White Sands National Monument in southern New Mexico, Petrified Forest National Park in northern Arizona and Casa Grande Ruins National Monument in south-central Arizona.Access to major parts of Sequoia and Kings Canyon parks were closed, and at Joshua Tree National Park, the administration policy of leaving parks open to visitors despite the staff furloughs resulted in park damage, including the toppling of protected trees.In Texas, Big Bend National Park had no visitor services, such as restrooms.Some trailheads were closed.Regulations continued to be enforced, as the park remained open.Visitors were reminded to remove their own trash and toilet paper.The Alamo remained open but no NPS services were available at the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park.Channel Islands National Park remained open to public access, although services normally provided by the national park service were instead provided by Island Packers Cruises, the company normally in charge of ferries to the islands.\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration closed immediately on December 22, 2018.The Library of Congress, the U.S. Botanic Garden, the Capitol Visitor Center, and the U.S. Capitol Building remained open as they were funded by the 2019 Legislative Branch appropriations bill.The Smithsonian Institution operated on ""prior-year funds"" through January 1, 2019.On January 2, 2019, the Smithsonian Institution initiated an orderly shutdown of all its facilities, including 19 museums in Washington, D.C., and New York City, the National Zoo, and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.The following day, the National Gallery of Art was closed.The National Zoo also closed on January 3, 2019.Tourism attendance on the National Mall was affected.On January 5, 2019, acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt directed the diversion of fee revenue defined by the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to be used to fund minimal maintenance activities so as to preserve access to highly visited parks.\n\nAccording to a January 12, 2019, article in The Economist, on January 11, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was unable to pay its workers who had not been paid since December 22; 55% more of them called in sick than in January 2018.\n\nAs the air traffic controllers were deemed essential employees, they were required to work without pay.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents air traffic controllers, filed a lawsuit against the federal government for the shutdown on January 11, 2019, claiming that requiring 16,000 air traffic controllers to work without being paid violated their constitutional rights and federal minimum wage law.That was the third lawsuit filed against the federal government since the beginning of the shutdown.\n\nAirline and aircraft safety inspectors, on the other hand, were deemed nonessential and furloughed.A news report on January 12, 2019, stated that the Federal Aviation Administration had returned 500 furloughed safety inspectors back to work and would return more to work in the following weeks.As the airline and aircraft safety inspectors were furloughed, the certification process of the Airbus A220 in the US was stalled.Delta Air Lines was forced to delay the launch of the new aircraft, and to use other models of aircraft to serve those routes that was supposed to be served with A220.Many TSA employees also called out sick, most of them because they were trying to find other jobs that would provide immediate paychecks.\n\nThe shutdown initially prevented the National Transportation Safety Board from assisting the Mexican government\'s investigation of the 2018 Puebla helicopter crash that killed a state governor and senator; an exception allowed the NTSB to assist with the Mexican government in the investigation along with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.The NTSB also had to delay several investigations until the government reopened and only continued investigations into accidents that were considered the most serious.Issues in receiving certification and oversight from the FAA led to a month-long delay in the commencement of passenger service at Paine Field in Everett, Washington.\n\nAs the shutdown continued into its fourth week, the unions representing airline pilots, flight attendants and air traffic controllers issued a statement asserting, ""we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play"" because of the shutdown.\n\nSome airports such as the Philadelphia International Airport, launched food and item donations for federal employees who were affected by the shutdown.Other airports such as the Miami International Airport, and the George Bush International Airport, closed down terminals in order to spread out the TSA workers that were available.\n\nOn January 25, flights destined for LaGuardia Airport in New York were halted to a groundstop by FAA officials due to staffing shortages directly as a result of the shutdown.As a result, several flights to and from neighboring airports in the Northeast, specifically Philadelphia and Newark, suffered significant delays of their own.Soon after that, appropriations passed and the government reopened.\n\nThe shutdown delayed software updates to the Boeing 737 MAX airplane which may have caused the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.\n\nDuring the shutdown, court-appointed private lawyers who represent indigent defendants worked without pay.The Federal Judiciary initially had a goal of sustaining paid operations through January 18, 2019.It said it would run out of money to sustain court operations no earlier than January 25, but perhaps as late as February 1.Failing funding, the Judiciary would operate under the terms of the Antideficiency Act.This Act does not allow federal agencies to expend federal funds before an appropriation, nor to accept any voluntary services.The judiciary had 33,000 employees nationwide.Under the Constitution, Supreme Court Justices, appeals court judges and district judges would continue to be paid.\n\nThe shutdown caused many delays and disruptions in cases.Budgets were watched carefully to be able to pay public defenders, DNA testing, informants, and travel costs to interview victims and witnesses.Staffing issues also brought about concerns and constraints with prisons lacking the staff to safely hold attorney-client visits, and caused a delay in bail hearings.\n\nAgents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed in a report released on January 22, 2019, by the FBI Agents Association, that several different investigations were compromised by the shutdown.The report was called ""Voices from the Field"" and was 72 pages long.FBI agents were unable to pay Confidential Human Sources which risks losing that informant permanently.Some FBI divisions no longer have Spanish-speaking staff on hand and could not work with informants who only speak Spanish.Some agents reported that they did not have the funds to assist in joint operations with local law enforcement.\n\nFederal law enforcement agencies working on Native American land worked without pay through the shutdown.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was forced to cancel a trip to the United States/Mexico border in early January due to the shutdown.DHS was also unable to inspect Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities during the shutdown to ensure that immigrants were being held in facilities appropriately.During the shutdown, the federal government\'s e-Verify system—a system for employers to check the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States—was halted.\n\nDuring the shutdown, a wave of Domain Name System (DNS) attacks on government sites was detected by Homeland Security.The attacks were serious because these Internet sites could be hijacked.\n\nOfficial websites for agencies were rendered insecure or inaccessible through the shutdown, as the expired digital certificates were not renewed.On January 23, DHS asked all government agencies to secure their DNS records; however, many agencies were not able to respond quickly to this request.\n\nExecutive and legislative affairs of the local government of the District of Columbia continued operating through the shutdown, due to a provision previously enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017.The District\'s local court system, including the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, are part of the federal judiciary.Thus, they were partially shut down, preventing District residents from accessing services such as marriage licensing.The District of Columbia government said it would take over trash collection and snow plowing operations for National Park Service facilities in Washington.\n\nThe shutdown also interfered with the response to the 2018 Sunda Strait tsunami, as the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta\'s Twitter account was unable to tweet updates, and the United States Geological Survey was unable to provide data on the tsunami.The American weather model, the GFS, suffered a significant drop in forecast quality when a data format change during the shutdown prevented certain weather data from being recognized by the GFS, and the shutdown prevented the bug from being corrected.\n\nBy mid-day Thursday, January 3, 2019, the FCC had suspended operations.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai canceled his trip to the Consumer Electronics Show.The FTC also suspended certain online operations.The EPA and Department of Energy\'s Energy Star website was not available for the duration of the shutdown.\n\nMakers of alcoholic beverages were unable to receive approval from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau for new labels and recipes during the shutdown.\n\nBased on the recalculation of their operating reserves, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) would have had to cease patent operations in the second week of February.A cadre of personnel was allocated to continue receiving patent applications, receive payments, and maintain the IT infrastructure.Even though the USPTO is self-funded, a Congressional appropriation is required to permit the USPTO to spend money.The pipeline of patent applications at the time took 15.8 months for a response from an examiner.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution shortened to two days and downscaled its scheduled ten-day 2019 Folklife Festival on the National Mall because of the shutdown\'s effects.Sabrina Motley, the director of the festival, said that initially, crucial funding for the June—July event arrived later than expected, slowing preparations.Motley stated: ""The government opened back up, but it took a while for systems to come back online. ...We looked at our production schedule, and it became clear we would need more time than we had.""\n\nThe White House residence staff who stage public receptions were among those furloughed, with a minimal staff continuing to work unpaid for the first family.In the midst of the shutdown Trump invited the Clemson Tigers football team to a White House dinner reception on January 14 in recognition of their College Football Playoff National Championship win.On the morning of the reception Trump announced that he intended to serve fast food hamburgers and pizza to the team, a remark that some commentators interpreted as a joke.That evening Trump welcomed the team in the State Dining Room with a buffet of fast food and pizza from McDonald\'s, Wendy\'s and other restaurant chains, which he stated that he had paid for personally.Trump served fast food to other visiting athletes later that year, after the shutdown had ended.\n\nOn January 10, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with several other unions, announced plans to protest the government shutdown at 1:00pm EST in Washington, DC.Leaders of the National Federation of Federal Employees stated they had hoped that bringing federal workers to the President\'s doorstep would show him that it was the individual workers that the shutdown was hurting the most.President Trump had left to visit the US–Mexican border in Texas earlier in the day.\n\nSimilar protests took place in Philadelphia and St. Louis, among other cities.On January 15, representatives for Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, and Vietnam Veterans of America along with others called for an end to shutdown, but avoided placing any blame on political parties.\n\nShortly after the protests, the American Federation of Government Employees sued the Trump administration to challenge the arrangements for work without pay during the shutdown.A similar suit was raised and won during the 2013 Federal Government shutdown.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association also sued the Trump administration, as the shutdown allegedly violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by failing to pay the workers at least a minimum wage during the shutdown.\n\nAs the salaries for members of Congress are written into permanent law and not funded through annual appropriations, the government shutdown did not affect their salaries.Senators and Representatives were still paid their biweekly salaries of $6,700 towards at least $174,000 a year.\n\nSeveral Democratic and Republican Senators and Representatives said they would donate or refuse their salary during the shutdown.Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw stated that he would refuse his salary, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto indicated she would donate hers to a Nevada charity, Senator Mazie Hirono said she would donate her salary to Hawaii food banks, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would give hers to refugee non-profit HIAS, New York Congressman Max Rose stated that he would give his salary to charity and outgoing Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota pledged hers to charity, along with her Republican colleague John Hoeven.Republican senator Kevin Cramer, who defeated Heidi Heitkamp in the 2018 midterm elections, refused to donate his salary, calling the move ""gimmicky"".Representative Brian Fitzpatrick urged all members of Congress to decline their paychecks.He said, ""If you\'re in Congress, don\'t just delay your pay -- forfeit it, write a check back to the US Treasury.Then you\'ll feel the pain of federal workers.""\n\nBy January 17, 2019, 102 members of Congress—20 Senators and 82 Representatives— chose to decline their paychecks or were donating their paychecks to charity.\n\nDuring the shutdown, many federal workers used food banks and food pantries in order to feed themselves and their families.Many food pantries waived certain restrictions in order to help government workers have access to food.During the shutdown, the Salvation Army Emergency Disasters Services program provided meals for federal workers.Chef Jose Andres created the #ChefsForFeds program to feed federal workers in Washington, D.C. and by January 21, made announcements to expand the program nationwide.\n\nSome states such as California, offered furloughed employees unemployment benefits, although the Trump administration allegedly told states that they could not do so with federal funds.Organizations such as state Attorney Generals offices, and credit card companies posted statements to their websites to offer a means to help to consolidate debt, meet mortgages or other payments such as child support or tuition.An employment law firm offered pro bono legal advice to furloughed federal employees.School districts opened up free or reduced lunch options for children of federal employees, and looked into other options to aid parents amid concerns that financial stress at home would adversely affect families and children.Every mainline denomination in America has contributed to efforts to provide relief.One Baptist church emptied its entire disaster fund to aid federal employees.\n\nOn January 24, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross downplayed the financial difficulties faced by the 800,000 federal workers affected by the shutdown, stating that they should borrow money to ""tide them over"" until the shutdown ends.Critics and Democrats criticized the statement as inappropriate, noting that Ross\' own net worth is estimated at almost $700 million, accusing him of being out of touch with the workers.Ross also said that he ""did not understand"" why people who were not getting paid due to the shutdown were visiting food banks.When asked about Ross\' statement, Trump suggested that grocery stores will ""work along"" with the government by voluntarily extending credit to those who are out of funds to buy food.National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow characterized the shutdown as a ""glitch"" and suggested that federal workers who were required to work without pay were ""volunteering"" to work for their love of the country and ""presumably their allegiance to President Trump.""\n\nIn a video message to staff, FBI director Christopher Wray stated, ""Making some people stay home when they don\'t want to, and making others show up without pay, it\'s mind-boggling, it\'s shortsighted and it\'s unfair.It takes a lot to get me angry, but I\'m about as angry as I\'ve been in a long, long time.""\n\nLara Trump, a daughter-in-law of the President, drew outrage after an interview in which she stated that while ""It\'s not fair to you..."" the shutdown was ""...a little bit of pain, but it\'s going to be for the future of our country, and their children and their grandchildren and generations after them will thank them for their sacrifice right now.""Her comments drew criticism by politicians, celebrities, and the general public who felt the advisor and spokeswoman for the Trump 2020 campaign was out of touch, however Lara Trump later claimed the comments were taken out of context.\n\nIn January 2019, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that 56% of the responding public opposed a wall while 39% favored it, and 45% viewed the situation at the border as a crisis.The numbers were similar to the poll in December 2018 yet a later poll by ABC News showed that as the partial shutdown entered its fourth week support for building a wall was increasing.A poll done through YouGov between December 23–25, 2018, reported that 51% of respondents thought Trump deserved ""a lot"" of the blame, 44% thought congressional Democrats and 39% thought congressional Republicans.Similar results were reported by a December 21–25 survey done by Reuters and Ipsos in which 47% of respondents said that the shutdown was the President\'s fault and 33% blamed Congressional Democrats.\n\nOver the course of the shutdown, Trump\'s approval rating marginally declined while his disapproval rating marginally increased.His net approval rating was by the middle of January 2019 at its lowest point since February 2018.On December 27, 2018, it was reported that Trump\'s approval rating of registered voters was at 39%, with 56% disapproval.Broken down the rating was split across party lines, with Republicans reporting an 80% approval rate while Democrats and independents reported a 90% and 57% disapproval rating, respectively.The poll was conducted through Morning Consult between December 21–23.The poll also reported that 43% of respondents blamed Trump for the shutdown, with 31% blaming congressional Democrats and 7% congressional Republicans.Another poll through The New York Times Upshot/Siena College reported that 89% of voters\' views on Trump and the wall were aligned, suggesting that support for the wall was a function of support for Trump.\n\nThe Washington Post–ABC News poll published on January 13, 2019, found that a larger number of Americans blamed Trump and congressional Republicans than congressional Democrats for the shutdown.A PBS NewsHour–Marist poll found that on January 15, 2019, a majority of Americans thought that President Trump was to blame for the shutdown.A January 2019 poll conducted by telephone for CBS News found that 70% of Americans polled did not want a government shutdown over the issue of building a border wall; 66% believed that Trump should agree to a budget without wall funding.\n\nPresidency of Donald Trump Donald Trump January 2018 United

55,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018–2019 United States federal government shutdown', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The United States federal government shutdown from midnight EST on December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019 (35 days) was the longest government shutdown in history and the second and final federal government shutdown involving furloughs during the presidency of Donald Trump.It occurred when the 115th Congress and Trump could not agree on an appropriations bill to fund the operations of the federal government for the 2019 fiscal year, or a temporary continuing resolution that would extend the deadline for passing a bill.The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal departments or agencies from conducting non-essential operations without appropriations legislation in place.As a result, nine executive departments with around 800,000 employees had to shut down partially or in full, affecting about one-fourth of government activities and causing employees to be furloughed or required to work without being paid.The Congressional Budget Office estimated the shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion USD, excluding indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.\n\nThe shutdown stemmed from an impasse over Trump\'s demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall.In December 2018, the Senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the bill appeared likely to be approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Trump.After Trump faced heavy criticism from some right-wing media outlets and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to ""build the wall"", he announced that he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund its construction.As a result, the House passed a stopgap bill with funding for the wall, but it was blocked in the Senate by the threat of a Democratic filibuster.\n\nIn January 2019, representatives elected in the November 2018 election took office, giving the Democrats a majority in the House.The House immediately voted to approve the appropriations bill that had previously passed the Senate unanimously (which included no funding for the wall).For several weeks, Trump continued to maintain that he would veto any bill that did not fund an entire border wall, and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the Senate from considering any appropriations legislation that Trump would not support, including the bill that had previously passed.Democrats and some Republicans opposed the shutdown and passed multiple bills to reopen the government, arguing that the government shutdown amounted to ""hostage-taking"" civil servants and that negotiations could only begin once the government was reopened.\n\nOn January 25, 2019, Trump agreed to endorse a stopgap bill to reopen the government for three weeks up until February 15 to allow for negotiations to take place to approve an appropriations bill that both parties could agree on.However, Trump reiterated his demand for the border wall funding and said that he would shut down the government again or declare a national emergency and use military funding to build the wall if Congress did not appropriate the funds by February 15.\n\nTrump\'s approval rating dropped during the shutdown.A majority of Americans opposed exploitation of the shutdown as a negotiating strategy and held Trump responsible for the shutdown: A CBS News poll found that 71% of Americans considered the border wall ""not worth the shutdown"" and a Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 53% of Americans blamed Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, compared to 34% who blamed Democrats and 10% who blamed both parties.\n\nOn February 15, 2019, Trump declared a national emergency to fund the wall and bypass Congress, after being unsatisfied with a bipartisan border bill that had passed the House and the Senate a day before.\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign, then-candidate Trump promised to build a wall along the Mexico–United States border for which Mexico would pay.The president of Mexico rejected the idea of providing any funding for a U.S. border wall.In 2018, Trump requested $ in federal funding for some of barrier on the border, mostly to replace of aging fence built under the Secure Fence Act of 2006.On December 25, 2018, Trump reversed course, suggesting that he might accept of either mostly refurbished barrier (rather than new barriers in locations that did not previously have them) by November 2020.Trump\'s proposals and public statements on the wall have shifted widely over time, with varied proposals as to the design, material, length, height, and width of a wall.\n\nIn September 2018, Congress passed two ""minibus"" appropriations bills for the 2019 United States federal budget, which began on October 1, 2018.These bills combined five of the 12 regular appropriations bills covering 77% of federal discretionary funding, and included a continuing resolution until December 7 for the remaining agencies.On December 6, Congress passed a second continuing resolution to December 21, to give more time for negotiations on Trump\'s proposed border wall, which had been delayed due to the funeral of George H. W. Bush.\n\nA Senate Homeland Security appropriations bill, negotiated by both parties and reported by the committee to the Senate, provided for $ for border security, including funds for ""approximately 65 miles of pedestrian fencing along the southwest border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector"".The bill did not receive a vote on the Senate floor, although House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer indicated that such a proposal could be acceptable to House Democrats.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said the Democratic Party would not support $ for the border wall.At a press conference before the government shutdown, he noted ""the $1.6 billion for border security negotiated by Democrats and Republicans is our position.We believe that is the right way to go.""\n\nOn December 11, President Trump held a televised meeting with Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in the Oval Office and asked them to support an appropriation of $5.7 billion for funding of a border wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico.They refused, resulting in an argument between Trump and both Congressional leaders.During the contentious discussion, Trump remarked, ""I am proud to shut down the government for border security ...I will be the one to shut [the government] down.I\'m not going to blame you for it ...I will take the mantle.I will be the one to shut it down.""Schumer replied, ""We shouldn\'t shut down the government over a dispute.""Ten days later, Trump blamed Democrats for the impending shutdown.\n\nThree days later, Politico reported that Trump was willing to sign a bill with no funding for a border wall that delayed a government shutdown into 2019 and the new Congress.On December 18, following a meeting with Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the government would not shut down on December 22 and that Trump was ""flexible"" over funding for a border wall.Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby commented that the most likely resolution was a bill that funded the government until early February.Schumer added that his caucus would ""very seriously"" consider such a bill and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said ""I don\'t know anybody on the Hill that wants a shutdown, and I think all the president\'s advisers are telling him this would not be good.""\n\nOn December 19, the Senate passed a second continuing resolution () that would fund the government until February 8, 2019.Pelosi announced that House Democrats would support the measure, meaning it would overcome opposition from conservative Republicans and pass the House.On December 20, following increased criticism from conservative media, pundits, and political figures, Trump reversed his position and declared that he would not sign any funding bill that did not include border wall funding.The same day, the House passed a continuing resolution that included $5 billion for the wall and $8 billion in disaster aid.This bill failed in the Senate.Trump\'s changing position caused consternation among Senate Republicans.\n\nThe shutdown started December 22 and Trump announced that he would cancel his planned trip to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas and stay in Washington, D.C.The meaning of the term ""wall"" was expected to be an aspect of the negotiations.\n\nCongress adjourned on December 22 for the Christmas and holiday season, with many predicting that the shutdown would not be resolved until the start of the 116th Congress.The Senate reconvened on December 27 for four minutes, with Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) presiding over the session.The House briefly reconvened as well, with Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) saying that members should not expect any further votes for the rest of 2018.Representative Jim McGovern (D-MA) went to the House floor to try to force consideration of a short-term funding bill to end the shutdown that the Senate had already passed, but the Republican Speaker-pro-tem refused to let him speak.\n\nCongress then adjourned again until December 31, 2018, for a pro forma session.On January 2, 2019, the last full day of the 115th United States Congress, there was a pro forma session scheduled to last several minutes.\n\nThe new Congress was sworn in on January 3, 2019, and one of the first orders of business in the House after electing the Speaker and swearing in the new members was a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security until February 8 (), which passed by a vote of 239–192; and a package combining five appropriation bills funding the rest of the government for the remainder of the fiscal year (), passed by a vote of 241–190.The bills contained $1.3 billion of funding for border security, but no additional funding for a border wall.\n\nBeginning on January 9, the Democratic-controlled House voted on four appropriations bills individually:\n\nFinancial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Treasury (including the Internal Revenue Service), federal judiciary, District of Columbia, and a number of independent agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, General Services Administration, and Securities and Exchange Commission.The House passed the legislation on January 9, on a 240–188 vote, with every Democrat and eight Republicans voting yes, and all other Republicans voting no. Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Department of Agriculture (including food stamps), the Food and Drug Administration, and related entities.On January 10, the House passed this bill 243–183.Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore Transportation and Housing and Urban Development (including some federal mortgage programs).On January 10, the House passed this bill 244–180.Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Interior Department, Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies, including the Smithsonian Institution.On January 11, ten House Republicans voted with Democrats in a 240–179 vote to end the shutdown of Interior-Environment programs.It was the most recent of a ""series of standalone appropriations measures"" the House sent to the Senate.\n\nThis strategy has been compared to one used by Republicans during the 2013 shutdown in the form of a series of fourteen mini-continuing resolutions.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed that the Senate would not consider the House bills to reopen the government, indicating that Senate Republicans would not support any bill unless it had Trump\'s support.In January 2019, McConnell and Senate Republicans came under increased pressure to break the impasse and reopen the government.Three Republican Senators—Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Cory Gardner of Colorado—called for an end to the shutdown.Senators Collins and Gardner said they supported the House\'s budget bills to end the shutdown.West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito said that she could support ending the shutdown provided border wall talks continued.Pat Roberts of Kansas said that shutdowns ""never work"" and only turned affected federal workers into ""pawns"" and that, although the time had not yet come for Senate Republicans to override any possible Trump veto and end the shutdown, ""we\'re getting pretty close.""Johnny Isakson of Georgia echoed that sentiment, saying that support for McConnell\'s refusal to support bills that do not include funding for a wall would not last indefinitely: ""There\'s a time when that may run out.""\n\nOn January 16, McConnell again blocked the House appropriation bills to reopen the government from being considered on the Senate floor.The following day, McConnell blocked consideration of bills to reopen most of the closed government agencies for a third time.On January 23, McConnell blocked a bill to reopen most of the government for the fourth time.\n\nOn January 22, McConnell stated that the Senate would be voting on two different bills to end the shutdown on January 24.The first vote is on a bill to reopen the government which includes Trump\'s proposal to provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and temporary protections to some immigration classes.The other bill is a three-week continuing resolution to fund 25% of the government through February 8.\n\nOn January 22, Senator Mark Warner introduced a bill to keep the federal government running in the event of future shutdown events.The bill is called the ""Stop Shutdowns Transferring Unnecessary Pain and Inflicting Damage in the Coming Years Act"" or the ""Stop STUPIDITY Act"".\n\nOn January 24, the Senate held two votes on competing Democratic and Republican proposals to end the shutdown.The Democratic proposal was largely similar to the measure that had previously passed the Senate unanimously in the 115th Congress, and then been passed by the Democratic-controlled House in the 116th Congress.It provided funding for the government with no money for the border wall.The Republican proposal incorporated Trump\'s proposal, which would fund a border wall; temporarily extend TPS and DACA for three years, but would substantially narrow eligibility for DACA; and make significant legal changes to make it more difficult for persons escaping violence and persecution to be granted asylum in the United States.Neither proposal was able to attain the 60 votes needed for passage.The Trump plan failed in a 50–47 vote.The Democratic plan failed in a 52–44 vote.Most Republicans voted for Trump\'s plan and against the Democratic plan.Most Democrats voted for the Democratic plan and against Trump\'s plan.Republicans Tom Cotton and Mike Lee voted against both plans.Democrat Joe Manchin and Republicans Lamar Alexander, Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, Johnny Isakson, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney voted for both plans.Not voting on either were Republicans Rand Paul and Jim Risch and Democrat Jacky Rosen.Republican Richard Burr voted for Trump\'s plan and did not vote on the Democratic plan.\n\nOn January 25, House Democrats prepared a compromise proposal to reopen the government, which would provide $5 billion for border security but no wall construction.However, the shutdown ended the same day.\n\nOn January 4, after the new Congress was sworn-in and Pelosi regained the speakership, she and Schumer, as well as congressional Republican leadership met with Trump at the White House.Pelosi and Schumer argued that the shutdown needed to end and reported that Trump refused.They said that Trump threatened to ""keep the government closed for a very long period of time.Months or even years.""Later that day, Trump admitted to ""absolutely"" making that threat, adding, ""I\'m very proud of doing what I\'m doing.""Trump then said that he was considering declaring a national emergency to use military funding for the wall.At the meeting, Trump reprimanded his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney for attempting to propose a compromise between Trump\'s $5.7 billion demand for a border wall and the Democrats\' proposal of $1.3 billion for border security.\n\nTrump addressed the nation from the Oval Office at 9 p.m. EST on January 8, in a nationally televised address broadcast on both network and cable television.In his speech, Trump asserted that there was a ""growing humanitarian and security crisis"" on the Mexico–United States border that could only be solved by appropriating $5.7 billion for construction of a steel wall.Trump did not make any new proposals in his speech to break the impasse.Immediately after Trump\'s speech, Schumer and Pelosi delivered a response on behalf of the Democrats, in which they demanded an end to the shutdown and said: ""President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government.""\n\nTrump met with congressional leadership again on January 9, in a meeting lasting 14 minutes.Trump asked Pelosi, ""Will you agree to my wall?"" and when she replied that she would not, Trump said ""bye-bye"" and walked out of the meeting, later declaring it ""a total waste of time"".Schumer accused Trump of throwing a ""temper tantrum"" and slamming his hands on the table.Trump rebuked Schumer\'s comments on Twitter.Vice President Mike Pence and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that Trump remained calm and never raised his voice.On January 10, Pelosi described the preceding day\'s meeting with Trump as ""a setup"" staged by White House aides so that Trump could walk out of the meeting.Pelosi described Trump as ""un-presidential""; accused him of ""exploiting this situation in a way that enhances his power""; and said: ""I don\'t think he really wants a solution.I think he loves the distraction.""\n\nAfter Trump walked out of the January 9 meeting with congressional Democratic leaders, no further negotiations were conducted.Several Republican senators met in the office of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, after the meeting to discuss a compromise to end the shutdown.They discussed agreeing to Trump\'s demand for border wall funding and offering the Democrats help for Dreamers, refugee protections and extensions to H-2B visas.On January 13, Graham proposed that Trump agree to a congressional vote to reopen the government pending the resumption of negotiations.Graham suggested that if Trump and congressional Democrats did not come to an agreement at that time, Trump could declare a national emergency.Trump rejected this proposal the next day.\n\nOn January 19, Trump proposed a temporary extension of the two programs that protect about 700,000 immigrants from deportation—Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)—in exchange for funding for the border wall.The protections would be temporary, with no path to citizenship.Trump had previously revoked TPS for people from a number of Latin American and African countries, and taken steps to rescind DACA.In his remarks at the White House, Trump referred to a ""barrier"" rather than a ""wall"" and indicated that he aimed to erect ""steel barriers in high priority locations"" rather than ""a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea.""\n\nIn addition to funding a border wall, the 1,300-page Republican bill released after Trump made his proposal would make major changes to U.S. immigration policy (which were not included in Trump\'s public announcement).The legislation would severely restrict the ability of children from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to apply for asylum in the United States.Specifically, participation in the Central American Minors Program would be subject to an annual cap and migrant children would be barred from applying for asylum in person at the border, and only migrant children with a ""qualified"" parent in the U.S. would be eligible to apply.The bill would also create a new, more burdensome application process for TPS holders, and would exclude TPS holders from Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen.The American Immigration Lawyers Association government relations director said that the proposal ""would categorically block tens of thousands of children from ever applying for asylum,"" while a Cato Institute immigration analyst wrote that the proposal would not extend DACA, but rather replace it with ""a totally different program that will exclude untold thousands of Dreamers who would have been eligible under DACA.""\n\nDemocrats rejected Trump\'s proposal.In a speech on the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""The president\'s proposal is one-sided, harshly partisan and was made in bad faith.The asylum changes are a poison pill, if there ever was one.""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said extending the DACA proposal temporarily was ""unacceptable"" and a ""non-starter"" because it did not ""represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people\'s lives.""Analysts pointed out that Trump had previously rejected a deal that would have provided funding for the border wall in exchange for further protection for DACA recipients.Conversely, Republicans reacted positively to Trump\'s proposal, and Mitch McConnell said he would bring it to a vote in the Senate.\n\nDuring the shutdown, on January 8 in a press conference, a reporter asked Trump if he was considering declaring a national emergency, to which Trump replied, ""I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want"" and suggested that he could declare an emergency.After this, Trump repeatedly threatened to declare a national emergency to unilaterally order wall construction without congressional authorization.Some of Trump\'s advisors, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, reportedly attempted to dissuade him from doing so.Administration officials considered diverting hurricane-relief and wildfire-relief funds from a $13.9 billion February 2018 emergency supplemental appropriations bill (for disaster relief in Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California, among other places) in order to fund a wall, and directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to look into this possibility.\n\nAn attempt by Trump to invoke emergency powers would almost certainly have prompted a lengthy legal challenge in court.Democrats responded that Trump lacked the authority to declare a national emergency; Representative Adam Schiff called it a ""non-starter"" and said that ""if Harry Truman couldn\'t nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this President doesn\'t have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion dollar wall on the border.""Democratic Representative Nydia Velázquez said the notion of redirecting disaster-relief funds to a border wall was ""beyond appalling"".Presidents have declared emergencies in the past, but none has ""involved funding a policy goal after failing to win congressional approval"".Yale Law School professor Bruce Ackerman wrote that the declaration of a national emergency to build a wall as Trump suggested would be unconstitutional and illegal.Other scholars, such as Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice, believed that Trump could make a colorable argument that diverting military-construction appropriations for border-wall construction was legal, but that doing so would be an abuse of power.Law professor Ilya Somin stated that in the unlikely case that Trump succeeded in using the emergency powers in this way, it would set a dangerous precedent, which Republicans would come to regret next time the president was a Democrat.\n\nOn January 11, Trump—while maintaining he has the authority to do so anytime—said he was not in any rush to declare a national emergency to secure wall funding, saying he would rather see Congress ""do its job"" and that the Democrats ""should come back and vote.""The next day he again threatened to use emergency powers if Democrats did not ""come to their senses.""\n\nOn January 16, Pelosi sent a letter to Trump that indicated the House would be unavailable for the 2019 State of the Union Address that was scheduled for January 29.Pelosi wrote, ""Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government reopens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has reopened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on Jan. 29.""The delivery of the State of the Union address had been delayed or substantially changed on only two occasions since 1913.In a letter sent to the Speaker the next day, Trump said she would not be allowed to take military transport aircraft on scheduled visits to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan.Trump replied, ""We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the shutdown is over.""Pelosi and a congressional delegation had planned on visiting overseas American military personnel.\n\nOn January 23, Trump sent a letter to Pelosi insisting that there were no security concerns and that he would hold the State of the Union Address as scheduled.Trump wrote, ""Therefore, I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and Congress of the United States of America regarding the State of our Union.""In a letter sent in reply, Pelosi stated that the House would not consider a concurrent resolution to authorize the State of the Union Address in the House Chamber until the shutdown ended, writing, ""Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened.""\n\nTrump later stated he would look for an alternative, but then retracted that statement in a pair of tweets announcing that he would wait until the end of the shutdown to give the address in the House Chamber.\n\nOn January 25, Trump announced his support for a three-week funding measure that would reopen the government until February 15.The deal, which also moved forward with long-term Department of Homeland Security funding, did not include funds for a wall.As expected, the agreement provided federal employees with back pay.Both the Senate and House of Representatives passed the funding measure by voice vote, sending the resolution to the President\'s desk.Trump signed the bill the same day, ending the shutdown.\n\nLater in January, Republican senators voted unanimously against a bill to provide back pay to federal contractors.\n\nWithout legislation enacted by February 15, a new partial shutdown would have begun, three weeks after the last ended.A bipartisan group of senators and representatives reached an agreement ""in principle"" on February 11, but Trump did not say whether he would sign it.Included was $1.375 billion for 55 miles of steel border fencing.On February 13, it was reported that, against the wishes of Democratic leaders and many Republicans, Trump was blocking the provision of back pay to federal contractors who were still out of pocket from the shutdown.Both houses passed the bill February 14 with enough votes to override a veto if that happened.\n\nOn February 15, at the White House Rose Garden, Trump announced that he had signed the spending bill to keep the government open.He also declared a national emergency, hoping to get access to $8 billion to use for border security.\n\nAgencies funded by two ""minibus"" appropriations bills passed in September 2018 were not affected by the shutdown.About 380,000 federal employees were furloughed, and an additional 420,000 employees for the affected agencies were expected to work with their pay delayed until the end of the shutdown, totaling 800,000 workers affected out of 2.1 million civilian non-postal federal employees.As only about a quarter of the government was shut down, many people who are not federal employees did not fully realize the effects of the shutdown.\n\nAccording to and , these were the affected agencies:\n\nDepartment of State Department of the Treasury Department of Justice Most of the Department of the Interior Department of Agriculture Department of Commerce Department of Housing and Urban Development Department of Transportation Department of Homeland Security Some Department of Health and Human Services agencies Food and Drug Administration Indian Health Service Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Superfund Research Program Executive Office of the President Most independent agencies Judicial Branch\n\nUnaffected agencies include, according to and :\n\nDepartment of Defense Department of Labor Most of the Department of Health and Human Services Department of Energy Department of Education Department of Veterans Affairs Some Department of the Interior agencies Bureau of Reclamation Central Utah Project District of Columbia (excluding courts) Legislative Branch Social Security Administration Nuclear Regulatory Commission Appalachian Regional Commission Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board Delta Regional Authority Denali Commission Northern Border Regional Commission Southeast Crescent Regional Commission Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board American Battle Monuments Commission U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Cemeterial Expenses of the Army, including Arlington National Cemetery and Soldiers\' and Airmen\'s Home National Cemetery Armed Forces Retirement Home Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System Fund Intelligence Community Management Account Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled Corporation for National and Community Service Corporation for Public Broadcasting Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission Institute of Museum and Library Services Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission Medicare Payment Advisory Commission National Council on Disability National Labor Relations Board National Mediation Board Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission Railroad Retirement Board\n\nJobs affected included staff throughout the United States, not just DC area employees.FBI agents, federal corrections officers, FDA inspectors, NASA employees, TSA staff, Border Patrol staff and CBP officers, census staff, National Park Service staff, members of the Coast Guard, and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers either worked without pay or were furloughed, with increasing numbers of unpaid essential employees failing to show up for work.\n\nOn January 11, 800,000 workers for agencies shutdown or furloughed missed their first paycheck.Federal workers normally receive pay on federal holidays, which include Christmas, New Year\'s Day and potentially Martin Luther King Jr. Day.The shutdown affected the employees\' entitlement to paid holidays due to the shutdown.Unemployment assistance to federal workers furloughed under the government shutdown varied by locality.Only non-reporting workers were eligible for assistance, whereas furloughed workers who still reported to work were not.Workers who received unemployment assistance were required pay it back after the shut down ended and they received backpay.Some furloughed workers sought other employment opportunities while they were idled.However, external employment must meet agency-specific ethics guidelines, and mandatory reviews of external employment were also curtailed as most ethics officials were also furloughed.Federal employees were not able to use vacation or sick leave during the shutdown so scheduled holiday vacation time either became unpaid if the worker was deemed non-essential or was cancelled if the worker was deemed essential.In many cases unused leave over a certain threshold expired at year-end, but employees who had leave scheduled in advance of the shutdown did not have ""use or lose"" leave balances deducted from their accrued leave.Many furloughed employees took to crowd-funding campaigns to raise cash to replace missed paychecks, but these types of solicitations also run afoul of government ethics rules.\n\nAs furloughed federal workers and their families shared stories of their hardships, such as not being able to meet rent or mortgage payments and missed bills, the hashtag ""#ShutdownStories"" went viral on social media.The federal government\'s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) responded by publishing sample letters that employees could send to their creditors.One read, in part, ""I am a Federal employee who has recently been furloughed due to a lack of funding of my agency.Because of this, my income has been severely cut and I am unable to pay the entire cost of my mortgage, along with my other expenses.""Other federal workers reached out to other news outlets to share stories about having to stretch their budgets and the impact of the shutdown on their families.In addition to being unable to meet rent or pay bills, many federal workers around the country were unable to pay for groceries and turned to food banks.One federal prison guard in Louisiana attempted suicide after posting about the financial pressures of the shutdown on Facebook.\n\nThe OPM also suggested that employees who had landlords write: ""I would like to discuss with you the possibility of trading my services to perform maintenance (e.g. painting, carpentry work) in exchange for partial rent payments"" and suggested those who lacked funds to pay bills should hire personal attorneys to assist them.Other organizations also posted advice on how to ""find supplemental income""; the Coast Guard suggested that Coast Guard members ""have a garage sale, offer to watch children, walk pets or house sit"" while furloughed.\n\nOn January 4, The Washington Post reported that because the shutdown was triggered by the failure to enact spending bills that continued a federal government pay freeze, hundreds of senior Trump administration political appointees would receive a roughly $10,000 pay raise the following day.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the pending pay raise was an ""unnecessary byproduct of the shutdown.""\n\nOn January 10, the Senate approved by unanimous consent a bill (S.24, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019) providing that furloughed federal employees would receive back pay for the period of the furlough once appropriations were restored; the bill was approved the next day by the House on a vote of 411–7.Trump signed the bill into law on January 16.\n\nNative American tribes were not paid for treaties negotiated with the United States government.These treaties specified that the federal government must provide funding for health clinics, employee salaries, education, infrastructure and other services, which were not paid during the shutdown.Native lands are ""owned, managed and maintained by the federal government.""Native Americans who receive a per capita check for profits from oil and gas sales from tribal land did not receive check for the month of February.Roads were not plowed on tribal land, and some areas received significant snowfall.This caused people of the Navajo Nation to become trapped inside their homes.Food services, which fed 90,000 Native Americans in 2017, were halted.\n\nNative American communities had a high percentage of individuals who worked for the federal government and lost income during the shutdown.In North and South Dakota, one of the largest employers is the Indian Health Service.The Chippewa tribe reported an economic loss of nearly $100,000 daily in funds that the federal government was supposed to provide as a treaty obligation.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was closed for the shutdown.However, 60 percent of the Indian Health Service (IHS) continued to work without pay.IHS provides care for 2.2 million Native Americans and on January 23, began to deny care that was not considered ""life threatening.""The Bureau of Indian Education was able to stay open because it was funded on a different schedule.Unlike other government shutdowns, there was little outreach from the Trump Administration to Native Americans and the Chippewa tribe in Michigan was given a 24-hour notice that the shutdown would take place and affect the tribe.\n\nThe only military branch that was affected by the shutdown was the Coast Guard because it was part of the Department of Homeland Security, while the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps were all funded through the Department of Defense.Officials were able to fund payment on December 31, 2018, but were not able to do so for the paychecks of January 15 and 30, 2019, along with the pay and benefits for civilian workers and retirees.During the shutdown, the Coast Guard continued to engage in patrolling the American coastline and carrying out overseas missions in locations such as the Persian Gulf along with the Navy and in the Caribbean.Other issues arose in the payment processes for Coast Guard members Tricare Health and Dental Program payments, although the individuals were still covered.\n\nMilitary schools, such as the Coast Guard Academy and the National War College, lost funding due to the shutdown and the schools had to work to find funds to pay professors.\n\nAlthough the Department of Defense was not shut down, the February 4, 2019, date for release of the Pentagon\'s 2020 budget was delayed by at least one month.This had repercussions on the interim period which is usually used by Pentagon planners for adjustments before the 2020 fiscal year which will begin in October 2019.The White House Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the Pentagon request, was shut down when the Pentagon budget arrived in December, and remained inactive, so no work was done on the budget.\n\nOn February 25, 2019, the Pentagon\'s counter-drug (interdiction) funding has up to $85 million not yet obligated, but that money was planned for the known corridors in El Paso, Tucson, Yuma, and El Centro for border fencing, lighting, and road projects, so any funds which might possibly be intended for additional projects elsewhere along the border must be obligated by September 30, 2019, in order not to affect the known corridors.Otherwise appropriations above the $85 million not yet obligated for additional interdiction border projects will have to be approved by additional Congressional appropriations, to reach the $2 billion target.\n\nA January 28, 2019 Congressional Budget Office report estimated that the 35-day partial government shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion, including $3 billion in permanent losses; the CBO estimate excluded indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.The furloughing of 145,000 federal workers and 112,500 federal contractors in the Washington Metropolitan Area cost the regional economy $119 million each day, or 7.3% of the region\'s total output.That reduced GDP by over $2.8 billion in the Washington DC area alone.The shutdown also had a noticeable impact on hunger in the national capital region: food pantries in Washington DC and Northern Virginia reported an increase of around 10% in the number of people coming to pick up groceries, with most of that increase coming from federal workers and contractors.\n\nFitch Ratings warned that an extended shutdown might lead to a downgrade in the U.S.\'s Triple-A credit rating if lawmakers were unable to pass a budget or manage the debt ceiling.That in turn would make borrowing more costly for companies and American households, because it is the benchmark for many other lines of credit.The only time the U.S. credit rating has been downgraded by S&P was during the United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011.\n\nSome economists believed that an extended shutdown would weaken consumer confidence and heighten the risk of pushing the U.S. economy into a recession.Between 800,000 federal government employees and some 4 million federal contractors, the shutdown directly affected nearly 3% of the labor force of the United States; in a typical recession, unemployment increases 2–4%.The reduction in spending by those households combined with the reduction of government services could have macroeconomic results similar to a typical recession.The shutdown had an adverse effect on the budgets of state and local governments, as states covered some federal services (particularly the most vulnerable) during the shutdown.\n\nBy mid-January 2019, the White House Council of Economic Advisors estimated that each week of the shutdown reduced GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, the equivalent of 1.2 points per quarter.CEA chairman Kevin Hassett later acknowledged that GDP growth could decline to zero in the first quarter of 2019 if the shutdown lasted the entire quarter.\n\nAs tax season began in the United States on January 28, some 46,000 Internal Revenue Service workers were called back to work to ensure tax refunds and returns were not affected by the shutdown.The recalled workers allowed the department to continue operations that were automatic and those deemed necessary for the safety of human life or protection of government property, such as processing electronic returns, returns with payments, mailing tax forms, appeals, criminal law enforcement investigations and technical support.\n\nDuring the shutdown, 95% of federal staff for the USDA\'s Food and Nutrition Services were furloughed.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the food-stamp program, could be funded through a $3 billion contingency fund appropriated by Congress in 2018; if the shutdown had continued through March 2019, those funds would have been exhausted, leaving some 38 million Americans without food stamps and endangering food security.Concerns were raised that continuation of the shutdown could delay the issuance of some $140 billion in tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees most of the food supply in the U.S.In early January, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner, reported that the FDA suspended food inspections.He noted that inspection of foreign food was continuing as ""almost normal,"" because they are considered vital.Around January 14, ""high-risk"" food inspections resumed.As of January 22, 2019, 46 percent of the FDA were working, though 20 percent of them were working without pay.During the shutdown, two new recalls for contamination with Listeria or Salmonella took place.Consumer advocacy groups advised of food safety issues during the shutdown.Food safety attorney, Bill Marler, advocated against eating ""fresh, uncooked products on the market place.""Because there was a shortage of FDA inspectors, many imported perishable items, such as produce or flowers, were at risk of spoilage.Meat and some egg products are inspected by the USDA\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service.Federal legislation required those inspectors to remain working without pay.\n\nSchool administrations raised concern about how to feed children who purchase food at the schools for lunch, as funding concerns caused some districts to conserve food and funding.Many limited the amount or variation of foods available for the children to purchase, and alerted parents to the concerns and the limited availability of some of the items.Most schools affected were in high-poverty areas, and depended on federally funded lunch programs, such as the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) a federal grant established by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 and operated through the Department of Agriculture.Some 22 million students in nearly 100,000 schools received school meals through that operation.\n\nAs with the January 2018 shutdown, national parks were expected to be open to the extent practical, though there would be no staff and buildings would be closed.The shutdown affected national parks unevenly, some were accessible with bare-bones staffing levels, some operated with money from states or charitable groups, and others were locked off.Diane Regas, president and chief executive of the Trust for Public Land, called upon Trump to close all national parks to protect the public: by the third week of the shutdown, three people had died in national parks.This number was reported as being within \'usual\' levels.At Yosemite National Park, on January 4, 2019, a death from a fall went unreported for a week.\n\nBy January 1, 2019, the problems of neglected trash pileup, overflowing public toilets, and access to first aid were repeated across the Park system.Health and safety concerns were raised, with concerns by scientists that the expansive amount of garbage and human waste could impact water and soil quality, or cause damage to animals in the parks.Other issues that arose due to the shutdown included illegal campsites, protected agriculture being damaged, damaging of government property and trespassing on foot and by vehicle.\n\nNew York kept the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open, as it did during the January 2018 shutdown.Arizona and Utah were able to keep Grand Canyon National Park, Zion National Park, Arches National Park, and Bryce Canyon National Park open and provided services including public restrooms, shuttles and trash collection.Utah\'s funding included visitor centers.The sites closed outright in the southwest alone included Bandelier National Monument and Valles Caldera National Preserve in northern New Mexico, White Sands National Monument in southern New Mexico, Petrified Forest National Park in northern Arizona and Casa Grande Ruins National Monument in south-central Arizona.Access to major parts of Sequoia and Kings Canyon parks were closed, and at Joshua Tree National Park, the administration policy of leaving parks open to visitors despite the staff furloughs resulted in park damage, including the toppling of protected trees.In Texas, Big Bend National Park had no visitor services, such as restrooms.Some trailheads were closed.Regulations continued to be enforced, as the park remained open.Visitors were reminded to remove their own trash and toilet paper.The Alamo remained open but no NPS services were available at the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park.Channel Islands National Park remained open to public access, although services normally provided by the national park service were instead provided by Island Packers Cruises, the company normally in charge of ferries to the islands.\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration closed immediately on December 22, 2018.The Library of Congress, the U.S. Botanic Garden, the Capitol Visitor Center, and the U.S. Capitol Building remained open as they were funded by the 2019 Legislative Branch appropriations bill.The Smithsonian Institution operated on ""prior-year funds"" through January 1, 2019.On January 2, 2019, the Smithsonian Institution initiated an orderly shutdown of all its facilities, including 19 museums in Washington, D.C., and New York City, the National Zoo, and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.The following day, the National Gallery of Art was closed.The National Zoo also closed on January 3, 2019.Tourism attendance on the National Mall was affected.On January 5, 2019, acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt directed the diversion of fee revenue defined by the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to be used to fund minimal maintenance activities so as to preserve access to highly visited parks.\n\nAccording to a January 12, 2019, article in The Economist, on January 11, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was unable to pay its workers who had not been paid since December 22; 55% more of them called in sick than in January 2018.\n\nAs the air traffic controllers were deemed essential employees, they were required to work without pay.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents air traffic controllers, filed a lawsuit against the federal government for the shutdown on January 11, 2019, claiming that requiring 16,000 air traffic controllers to work without being paid violated their constitutional rights and federal minimum wage law.That was the third lawsuit filed against the federal government since the beginning of the shutdown.\n\nAirline and aircraft safety inspectors, on the other hand, were deemed nonessential and furloughed.A news report on January 12, 2019, stated that the Federal Aviation Administration had returned 500 furloughed safety inspectors back to work and would return more to work in the following weeks.As the airline and aircraft safety inspectors were furloughed, the certification process of the Airbus A220 in the US was stalled.Delta Air Lines was forced to delay the launch of the new aircraft, and to use other models of aircraft to serve those routes that was supposed to be served with A220.Many TSA employees also called out sick, most of them because they were trying to find other jobs that would provide immediate paychecks.\n\nThe shutdown initially prevented the National Transportation Safety Board from assisting the Mexican government\'s investigation of the 2018 Puebla helicopter crash that killed a state governor and senator; an exception allowed the NTSB to assist with the Mexican government in the investigation along with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.The NTSB also had to delay several investigations until the government reopened and only continued investigations into accidents that were considered the most serious.Issues in receiving certification and oversight from the FAA led to a month-long delay in the commencement of passenger service at Paine Field in Everett, Washington.\n\nAs the shutdown continued into its fourth week, the unions representing airline pilots, flight attendants and air traffic controllers issued a statement asserting, ""we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play"" because of the shutdown.\n\nSome airports such as the Philadelphia International Airport, launched food and item donations for federal employees who were affected by the shutdown.Other airports such as the Miami International Airport, and the George Bush International Airport, closed down terminals in order to spread out the TSA workers that were available.\n\nOn January 25, flights destined for LaGuardia Airport in New York were halted to a groundstop by FAA officials due to staffing shortages directly as a result of the shutdown.As a result, several flights to and from neighboring airports in the Northeast, specifically Philadelphia and Newark, suffered significant delays of their own.Soon after that, appropriations passed and the government reopened.\n\nThe shutdown delayed software updates to the Boeing 737 MAX airplane which may have caused the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.\n\nDuring the shutdown, court-appointed private lawyers who represent indigent defendants worked without pay.The Federal Judiciary initially had a goal of sustaining paid operations through January 18, 2019.It said it would run out of money to sustain court operations no earlier than January 25, but perhaps as late as February 1.Failing funding, the Judiciary would operate under the terms of the Antideficiency Act.This Act does not allow federal agencies to expend federal funds before an appropriation, nor to accept any voluntary services.The judiciary had 33,000 employees nationwide.Under the Constitution, Supreme Court Justices, appeals court judges and district judges would continue to be paid.\n\nThe shutdown caused many delays and disruptions in cases.Budgets were watched carefully to be able to pay public defenders, DNA testing, informants, and travel costs to interview victims and witnesses.Staffing issues also brought about concerns and constraints with prisons lacking the staff to safely hold attorney-client visits, and caused a delay in bail hearings.\n\nAgents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed in a report released on January 22, 2019, by the FBI Agents Association, that several different investigations were compromised by the shutdown.The report was called ""Voices from the Field"" and was 72 pages long.FBI agents were unable to pay Confidential Human Sources which risks losing that informant permanently.Some FBI divisions no longer have Spanish-speaking staff on hand and could not work with informants who only speak Spanish.Some agents reported that they did not have the funds to assist in joint operations with local law enforcement.\n\nFederal law enforcement agencies working on Native American land worked without pay through the shutdown.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was forced to cancel a trip to the United States/Mexico border in early January due to the shutdown.DHS was also unable to inspect Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities during the shutdown to ensure that immigrants were being held in facilities appropriately.During the shutdown, the federal government\'s e-Verify system—a system for employers to check the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States—was halted.\n\nDuring the shutdown, a wave of Domain Name System (DNS) attacks on government sites was detected by Homeland Security.The attacks were serious because these Internet sites could be hijacked.\n\nOfficial websites for agencies were rendered insecure or inaccessible through the shutdown, as the expired digital certificates were not renewed.On January 23, DHS asked all government agencies to secure their DNS records; however, many agencies were not able to respond quickly to this request.\n\nExecutive and legislative affairs of the local government of the District of Columbia continued operating through the shutdown, due to a provision previously enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017.The District\'s local court system, including the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, are part of the federal judiciary.Thus, they were partially shut down, preventing District residents from accessing services such as marriage licensing.The District of Columbia government said it would take over trash collection and snow plowing operations for National Park Service facilities in Washington.\n\nThe shutdown also interfered with the response to the 2018 Sunda Strait tsunami, as the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta\'s Twitter account was unable to tweet updates, and the United States Geological Survey was unable to provide data on the tsunami.The American weather model, the GFS, suffered a significant drop in forecast quality when a data format change during the shutdown prevented certain weather data from being recognized by the GFS, and the shutdown prevented the bug from being corrected.\n\nBy mid-day Thursday, January 3, 2019, the FCC had suspended operations.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai canceled his trip to the Consumer Electronics Show.The FTC also suspended certain online operations.The EPA and Department of Energy\'s Energy Star website was not available for the duration of the shutdown.\n\nMakers of alcoholic beverages were unable to receive approval from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau for new labels and recipes during the shutdown.\n\nBased on the recalculation of their operating reserves, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) would have had to cease patent operations in the second week of February.A cadre of personnel was allocated to continue receiving patent applications, receive payments, and maintain the IT infrastructure.Even though the USPTO is self-funded, a Congressional appropriation is required to permit the USPTO to spend money.The pipeline of patent applications at the time took 15.8 months for a response from an examiner.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution shortened to two days and downscaled its scheduled ten-day 2019 Folklife Festival on the National Mall because of the shutdown\'s effects.Sabrina Motley, the director of the festival, said that initially, crucial funding for the June—July event arrived later than expected, slowing preparations.Motley stated: ""The government opened back up, but it took a while for systems to come back online. ...We looked at our production schedule, and it became clear we would need more time than we had.""\n\nThe White House residence staff who stage public receptions were among those furloughed, with a minimal staff continuing to work unpaid for the first family.In the midst of the shutdown Trump invited the Clemson Tigers football team to a White House dinner reception on January 14 in recognition of their College Football Playoff National Championship win.On the morning of the reception Trump announced that he intended to serve fast food hamburgers and pizza to the team, a remark that some commentators interpreted as a joke.That evening Trump welcomed the team in the State Dining Room with a buffet of fast food and pizza from McDonald\'s, Wendy\'s and other restaurant chains, which he stated that he had paid for personally.Trump served fast food to other visiting athletes later that year, after the shutdown had ended.\n\nOn January 10, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with several other unions, announced plans to protest the government shutdown at 1:00pm EST in Washington, DC.Leaders of the National Federation of Federal Employees stated they had hoped that bringing federal workers to the President\'s doorstep would show him that it was the individual workers that the shutdown was hurting the most.President Trump had left to visit the US–Mexican border in Texas earlier in the day.\n\nSimilar protests took place in Philadelphia and St. Louis, among other cities.On January 15, representatives for Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, and Vietnam Veterans of America along with others called for an end to shutdown, but avoided placing any blame on political parties.\n\nShortly after the protests, the American Federation of Government Employees sued the Trump administration to challenge the arrangements for work without pay during the shutdown.A similar suit was raised and won during the 2013 Federal Government shutdown.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association also sued the Trump administration, as the shutdown allegedly violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by failing to pay the workers at least a minimum wage during the shutdown.\n\nAs the salaries for members of Congress are written into permanent law and not funded through annual appropriations, the government shutdown did not affect their salaries.Senators and Representatives were still paid their biweekly salaries of $6,700 towards at least $174,000 a year.\n\nSeveral Democratic and Republican Senators and Representatives said they would donate or refuse their salary during the shutdown.Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw stated that he would refuse his salary, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto indicated she would donate hers to a Nevada charity, Senator Mazie Hirono said she would donate her salary to Hawaii food banks, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would give hers to refugee non-profit HIAS, New York Congressman Max Rose stated that he would give his salary to charity and outgoing Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota pledged hers to charity, along with her Republican colleague John Hoeven.Republican senator Kevin Cramer, who defeated Heidi Heitkamp in the 2018 midterm elections, refused to donate his salary, calling the move ""gimmicky"".Representative Brian Fitzpatrick urged all members of Congress to decline their paychecks.He said, ""If you\'re in Congress, don\'t just delay your pay -- forfeit it, write a check back to the US Treasury.Then you\'ll feel the pain of federal workers.""\n\nBy January 17, 2019, 102 members of Congress—20 Senators and 82 Representatives— chose to decline their paychecks or were donating their paychecks to charity.\n\nDuring the shutdown, many federal workers used food banks and food pantries in order to feed themselves and their families.Many food pantries waived certain restrictions in order to help government workers have access to food.During the shutdown, the Salvation Army Emergency Disasters Services program provided meals for federal workers.Chef Jose Andres created the #ChefsForFeds program to feed federal workers in Washington, D.C. and by January 21, made announcements to expand the program nationwide.\n\nSome states such as California, offered furloughed employees unemployment benefits, although the Trump administration allegedly told states that they could not do so with federal funds.Organizations such as state Attorney Generals offices, and credit card companies posted statements to their websites to offer a means to help to consolidate debt, meet mortgages or other payments such as child support or tuition.An employment law firm offered pro bono legal advice to furloughed federal employees.School districts opened up free or reduced lunch options for children of federal employees, and looked into other options to aid parents amid concerns that financial stress at home would adversely affect families and children.Every mainline denomination in America has contributed to efforts to provide relief.One Baptist church emptied its entire disaster fund to aid federal employees.\n\nOn January 24, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross downplayed the financial difficulties faced by the 800,000 federal workers affected by the shutdown, stating that they should borrow money to ""tide them over"" until the shutdown ends.Critics and Democrats criticized the statement as inappropriate, noting that Ross\' own net worth is estimated at almost $700 million, accusing him of being out of touch with the workers.Ross also said that he ""did not understand"" why people who were not getting paid due to the shutdown were visiting food banks.When asked about Ross\' statement, Trump suggested that grocery stores will ""work along"" with the government by voluntarily extending credit to those who are out of funds to buy food.National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow characterized the shutdown as a ""glitch"" and suggested that federal workers who were required to work without pay were ""volunteering"" to work for their love of the country and ""presumably their allegiance to President Trump.""\n\nIn a video message to staff, FBI director Christopher Wray stated, ""Making some people stay home when they don\'t want to, and making others show up without pay, it\'s mind-boggling, it\'s shortsighted and it\'s unfair.It takes a lot to get me angry, but I\'m about as angry as I\'ve been in a long, long time.""\n\nLara Trump, a daughter-in-law of the President, drew outrage after an interview in which she stated that while ""It\'s not fair to you..."" the shutdown was ""...a little bit of pain, but it\'s going to be for the future of our country, and their children and their grandchildren and generations after them will thank them for their sacrifice right now.""Her comments drew criticism by politicians, celebrities, and the general public who felt the advisor and spokeswoman for the Trump 2020 campaign was out of touch, however Lara Trump later claimed the comments were taken out of context.\n\nIn January 2019, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that 56% of the responding public opposed a wall while 39% favored it, and 45% viewed the situation at the border as a crisis.The numbers were similar to the poll in December 2018 yet a later poll by ABC News showed that as the partial shutdown entered its fourth week support for building a wall was increasing.A poll done through YouGov between December 23–25, 2018, reported that 51% of respondents thought Trump deserved ""a lot"" of the blame, 44% thought congressional Democrats and 39% thought congressional Republicans.Similar results were reported by a December 21–25 survey done by Reuters and Ipsos in which 47% of respondents said that the shutdown was the President\'s fault and 33% blamed Congressional Democrats.\n\nOver the course of the shutdown, Trump\'s approval rating marginally declined while his disapproval rating marginally increased.His net approval rating was by the middle of January 2019 at its lowest point since February 2018.On December 27, 2018, it was reported that Trump\'s approval rating of registered voters was at 39%, with 56% disapproval.Broken down the rating was split across party lines, with Republicans reporting an 80% approval rate while Democrats and independents reported a 90% and 57% disapproval rating, respectively.The poll was conducted through Morning Consult between December 21–23.The poll also reported that 43% of respondents blamed Trump for the shutdown, with 31% blaming congressional Democrats and 7% congressional Republicans.Another poll through The New York Times Upshot/Siena College reported that 89% of voters\' views on Trump and the wall were aligned, suggesting that support for the wall was a function of support for Trump.\n\nThe Washington Post–ABC News poll published on January 13, 2019, found that a larger number of Americans blamed Trump and congressional Republicans than congressional Democrats for the shutdown.A PBS NewsHour–Marist poll found that on January 15, 2019, a majority of Americans thought that President Trump was to blame for the shutdown.A January 2019 poll conducted by telephone for CBS News found that 70% of Americans polled did not want a government shutdown over the issue of building a border wall; 66% believed that Trump should agree to a budget without wall funding.\n\nPresidency of Donald Trump Donald Trump January 2018 United

56,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018–2019 United States federal government shutdown', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The United States federal government shutdown from midnight EST on December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019 (35 days) was the longest government shutdown in history and the second and final federal government shutdown involving furloughs during the presidency of Donald Trump.It occurred when the 115th Congress and Trump could not agree on an appropriations bill to fund the operations of the federal government for the 2019 fiscal year, or a temporary continuing resolution that would extend the deadline for passing a bill.The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal departments or agencies from conducting non-essential operations without appropriations legislation in place.As a result, nine executive departments with around 800,000 employees had to shut down partially or in full, affecting about one-fourth of government activities and causing employees to be furloughed or required to work without being paid.The Congressional Budget Office estimated the shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion USD, excluding indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.\n\nThe shutdown stemmed from an impasse over Trump\'s demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall.In December 2018, the Senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the bill appeared likely to be approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Trump.After Trump faced heavy criticism from some right-wing media outlets and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to ""build the wall"", he announced that he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund its construction.As a result, the House passed a stopgap bill with funding for the wall, but it was blocked in the Senate by the threat of a Democratic filibuster.\n\nIn January 2019, representatives elected in the November 2018 election took office, giving the Democrats a majority in the House.The House immediately voted to approve the appropriations bill that had previously passed the Senate unanimously (which included no funding for the wall).For several weeks, Trump continued to maintain that he would veto any bill that did not fund an entire border wall, and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the Senate from considering any appropriations legislation that Trump would not support, including the bill that had previously passed.Democrats and some Republicans opposed the shutdown and passed multiple bills to reopen the government, arguing that the government shutdown amounted to ""hostage-taking"" civil servants and that negotiations could only begin once the government was reopened.\n\nOn January 25, 2019, Trump agreed to endorse a stopgap bill to reopen the government for three weeks up until February 15 to allow for negotiations to take place to approve an appropriations bill that both parties could agree on.However, Trump reiterated his demand for the border wall funding and said that he would shut down the government again or declare a national emergency and use military funding to build the wall if Congress did not appropriate the funds by February 15.\n\nTrump\'s approval rating dropped during the shutdown.A majority of Americans opposed exploitation of the shutdown as a negotiating strategy and held Trump responsible for the shutdown: A CBS News poll found that 71% of Americans considered the border wall ""not worth the shutdown"" and a Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 53% of Americans blamed Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, compared to 34% who blamed Democrats and 10% who blamed both parties.\n\nOn February 15, 2019, Trump declared a national emergency to fund the wall and bypass Congress, after being unsatisfied with a bipartisan border bill that had passed the House and the Senate a day before.\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign, then-candidate Trump promised to build a wall along the Mexico–United States border for which Mexico would pay.The president of Mexico rejected the idea of providing any funding for a U.S. border wall.In 2018, Trump requested $ in federal funding for some of barrier on the border, mostly to replace of aging fence built under the Secure Fence Act of 2006.On December 25, 2018, Trump reversed course, suggesting that he might accept of either mostly refurbished barrier (rather than new barriers in locations that did not previously have them) by November 2020.Trump\'s proposals and public statements on the wall have shifted widely over time, with varied proposals as to the design, material, length, height, and width of a wall.\n\nIn September 2018, Congress passed two ""minibus"" appropriations bills for the 2019 United States federal budget, which began on October 1, 2018.These bills combined five of the 12 regular appropriations bills covering 77% of federal discretionary funding, and included a continuing resolution until December 7 for the remaining agencies.On December 6, Congress passed a second continuing resolution to December 21, to give more time for negotiations on Trump\'s proposed border wall, which had been delayed due to the funeral of George H. W. Bush.\n\nA Senate Homeland Security appropriations bill, negotiated by both parties and reported by the committee to the Senate, provided for $ for border security, including funds for ""approximately 65 miles of pedestrian fencing along the southwest border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector"".The bill did not receive a vote on the Senate floor, although House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer indicated that such a proposal could be acceptable to House Democrats.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said the Democratic Party would not support $ for the border wall.At a press conference before the government shutdown, he noted ""the $1.6 billion for border security negotiated by Democrats and Republicans is our position.We believe that is the right way to go.""\n\nOn December 11, President Trump held a televised meeting with Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in the Oval Office and asked them to support an appropriation of $5.7 billion for funding of a border wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico.They refused, resulting in an argument between Trump and both Congressional leaders.During the contentious discussion, Trump remarked, ""I am proud to shut down the government for border security ...I will be the one to shut [the government] down.I\'m not going to blame you for it ...I will take the mantle.I will be the one to shut it down.""Schumer replied, ""We shouldn\'t shut down the government over a dispute.""Ten days later, Trump blamed Democrats for the impending shutdown.\n\nThree days later, Politico reported that Trump was willing to sign a bill with no funding for a border wall that delayed a government shutdown into 2019 and the new Congress.On December 18, following a meeting with Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the government would not shut down on December 22 and that Trump was ""flexible"" over funding for a border wall.Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby commented that the most likely resolution was a bill that funded the government until early February.Schumer added that his caucus would ""very seriously"" consider such a bill and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said ""I don\'t know anybody on the Hill that wants a shutdown, and I think all the president\'s advisers are telling him this would not be good.""\n\nOn December 19, the Senate passed a second continuing resolution () that would fund the government until February 8, 2019.Pelosi announced that House Democrats would support the measure, meaning it would overcome opposition from conservative Republicans and pass the House.On December 20, following increased criticism from conservative media, pundits, and political figures, Trump reversed his position and declared that he would not sign any funding bill that did not include border wall funding.The same day, the House passed a continuing resolution that included $5 billion for the wall and $8 billion in disaster aid.This bill failed in the Senate.Trump\'s changing position caused consternation among Senate Republicans.\n\nThe shutdown started December 22 and Trump announced that he would cancel his planned trip to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas and stay in Washington, D.C.The meaning of the term ""wall"" was expected to be an aspect of the negotiations.\n\nCongress adjourned on December 22 for the Christmas and holiday season, with many predicting that the shutdown would not be resolved until the start of the 116th Congress.The Senate reconvened on December 27 for four minutes, with Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) presiding over the session.The House briefly reconvened as well, with Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) saying that members should not expect any further votes for the rest of 2018.Representative Jim McGovern (D-MA) went to the House floor to try to force consideration of a short-term funding bill to end the shutdown that the Senate had already passed, but the Republican Speaker-pro-tem refused to let him speak.\n\nCongress then adjourned again until December 31, 2018, for a pro forma session.On January 2, 2019, the last full day of the 115th United States Congress, there was a pro forma session scheduled to last several minutes.\n\nThe new Congress was sworn in on January 3, 2019, and one of the first orders of business in the House after electing the Speaker and swearing in the new members was a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security until February 8 (), which passed by a vote of 239–192; and a package combining five appropriation bills funding the rest of the government for the remainder of the fiscal year (), passed by a vote of 241–190.The bills contained $1.3 billion of funding for border security, but no additional funding for a border wall.\n\nBeginning on January 9, the Democratic-controlled House voted on four appropriations bills individually:\n\nFinancial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Treasury (including the Internal Revenue Service), federal judiciary, District of Columbia, and a number of independent agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, General Services Administration, and Securities and Exchange Commission.The House passed the legislation on January 9, on a 240–188 vote, with every Democrat and eight Republicans voting yes, and all other Republicans voting no. Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Department of Agriculture (including food stamps), the Food and Drug Administration, and related entities.On January 10, the House passed this bill 243–183.Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore Transportation and Housing and Urban Development (including some federal mortgage programs).On January 10, the House passed this bill 244–180.Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Interior Department, Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies, including the Smithsonian Institution.On January 11, ten House Republicans voted with Democrats in a 240–179 vote to end the shutdown of Interior-Environment programs.It was the most recent of a ""series of standalone appropriations measures"" the House sent to the Senate.\n\nThis strategy has been compared to one used by Republicans during the 2013 shutdown in the form of a series of fourteen mini-continuing resolutions.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed that the Senate would not consider the House bills to reopen the government, indicating that Senate Republicans would not support any bill unless it had Trump\'s support.In January 2019, McConnell and Senate Republicans came under increased pressure to break the impasse and reopen the government.Three Republican Senators—Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Cory Gardner of Colorado—called for an end to the shutdown.Senators Collins and Gardner said they supported the House\'s budget bills to end the shutdown.West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito said that she could support ending the shutdown provided border wall talks continued.Pat Roberts of Kansas said that shutdowns ""never work"" and only turned affected federal workers into ""pawns"" and that, although the time had not yet come for Senate Republicans to override any possible Trump veto and end the shutdown, ""we\'re getting pretty close.""Johnny Isakson of Georgia echoed that sentiment, saying that support for McConnell\'s refusal to support bills that do not include funding for a wall would not last indefinitely: ""There\'s a time when that may run out.""\n\nOn January 16, McConnell again blocked the House appropriation bills to reopen the government from being considered on the Senate floor.The following day, McConnell blocked consideration of bills to reopen most of the closed government agencies for a third time.On January 23, McConnell blocked a bill to reopen most of the government for the fourth time.\n\nOn January 22, McConnell stated that the Senate would be voting on two different bills to end the shutdown on January 24.The first vote is on a bill to reopen the government which includes Trump\'s proposal to provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and temporary protections to some immigration classes.The other bill is a three-week continuing resolution to fund 25% of the government through February 8.\n\nOn January 22, Senator Mark Warner introduced a bill to keep the federal government running in the event of future shutdown events.The bill is called the ""Stop Shutdowns Transferring Unnecessary Pain and Inflicting Damage in the Coming Years Act"" or the ""Stop STUPIDITY Act"".\n\nOn January 24, the Senate held two votes on competing Democratic and Republican proposals to end the shutdown.The Democratic proposal was largely similar to the measure that had previously passed the Senate unanimously in the 115th Congress, and then been passed by the Democratic-controlled House in the 116th Congress.It provided funding for the government with no money for the border wall.The Republican proposal incorporated Trump\'s proposal, which would fund a border wall; temporarily extend TPS and DACA for three years, but would substantially narrow eligibility for DACA; and make significant legal changes to make it more difficult for persons escaping violence and persecution to be granted asylum in the United States.Neither proposal was able to attain the 60 votes needed for passage.The Trump plan failed in a 50–47 vote.The Democratic plan failed in a 52–44 vote.Most Republicans voted for Trump\'s plan and against the Democratic plan.Most Democrats voted for the Democratic plan and against Trump\'s plan.Republicans Tom Cotton and Mike Lee voted against both plans.Democrat Joe Manchin and Republicans Lamar Alexander, Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, Johnny Isakson, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney voted for both plans.Not voting on either were Republicans Rand Paul and Jim Risch and Democrat Jacky Rosen.Republican Richard Burr voted for Trump\'s plan and did not vote on the Democratic plan.\n\nOn January 25, House Democrats prepared a compromise proposal to reopen the government, which would provide $5 billion for border security but no wall construction.However, the shutdown ended the same day.\n\nOn January 4, after the new Congress was sworn-in and Pelosi regained the speakership, she and Schumer, as well as congressional Republican leadership met with Trump at the White House.Pelosi and Schumer argued that the shutdown needed to end and reported that Trump refused.They said that Trump threatened to ""keep the government closed for a very long period of time.Months or even years.""Later that day, Trump admitted to ""absolutely"" making that threat, adding, ""I\'m very proud of doing what I\'m doing.""Trump then said that he was considering declaring a national emergency to use military funding for the wall.At the meeting, Trump reprimanded his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney for attempting to propose a compromise between Trump\'s $5.7 billion demand for a border wall and the Democrats\' proposal of $1.3 billion for border security.\n\nTrump addressed the nation from the Oval Office at 9 p.m. EST on January 8, in a nationally televised address broadcast on both network and cable television.In his speech, Trump asserted that there was a ""growing humanitarian and security crisis"" on the Mexico–United States border that could only be solved by appropriating $5.7 billion for construction of a steel wall.Trump did not make any new proposals in his speech to break the impasse.Immediately after Trump\'s speech, Schumer and Pelosi delivered a response on behalf of the Democrats, in which they demanded an end to the shutdown and said: ""President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government.""\n\nTrump met with congressional leadership again on January 9, in a meeting lasting 14 minutes.Trump asked Pelosi, ""Will you agree to my wall?"" and when she replied that she would not, Trump said ""bye-bye"" and walked out of the meeting, later declaring it ""a total waste of time"".Schumer accused Trump of throwing a ""temper tantrum"" and slamming his hands on the table.Trump rebuked Schumer\'s comments on Twitter.Vice President Mike Pence and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that Trump remained calm and never raised his voice.On January 10, Pelosi described the preceding day\'s meeting with Trump as ""a setup"" staged by White House aides so that Trump could walk out of the meeting.Pelosi described Trump as ""un-presidential""; accused him of ""exploiting this situation in a way that enhances his power""; and said: ""I don\'t think he really wants a solution.I think he loves the distraction.""\n\nAfter Trump walked out of the January 9 meeting with congressional Democratic leaders, no further negotiations were conducted.Several Republican senators met in the office of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, after the meeting to discuss a compromise to end the shutdown.They discussed agreeing to Trump\'s demand for border wall funding and offering the Democrats help for Dreamers, refugee protections and extensions to H-2B visas.On January 13, Graham proposed that Trump agree to a congressional vote to reopen the government pending the resumption of negotiations.Graham suggested that if Trump and congressional Democrats did not come to an agreement at that time, Trump could declare a national emergency.Trump rejected this proposal the next day.\n\nOn January 19, Trump proposed a temporary extension of the two programs that protect about 700,000 immigrants from deportation—Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)—in exchange for funding for the border wall.The protections would be temporary, with no path to citizenship.Trump had previously revoked TPS for people from a number of Latin American and African countries, and taken steps to rescind DACA.In his remarks at the White House, Trump referred to a ""barrier"" rather than a ""wall"" and indicated that he aimed to erect ""steel barriers in high priority locations"" rather than ""a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea.""\n\nIn addition to funding a border wall, the 1,300-page Republican bill released after Trump made his proposal would make major changes to U.S. immigration policy (which were not included in Trump\'s public announcement).The legislation would severely restrict the ability of children from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to apply for asylum in the United States.Specifically, participation in the Central American Minors Program would be subject to an annual cap and migrant children would be barred from applying for asylum in person at the border, and only migrant children with a ""qualified"" parent in the U.S. would be eligible to apply.The bill would also create a new, more burdensome application process for TPS holders, and would exclude TPS holders from Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen.The American Immigration Lawyers Association government relations director said that the proposal ""would categorically block tens of thousands of children from ever applying for asylum,"" while a Cato Institute immigration analyst wrote that the proposal would not extend DACA, but rather replace it with ""a totally different program that will exclude untold thousands of Dreamers who would have been eligible under DACA.""\n\nDemocrats rejected Trump\'s proposal.In a speech on the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""The president\'s proposal is one-sided, harshly partisan and was made in bad faith.The asylum changes are a poison pill, if there ever was one.""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said extending the DACA proposal temporarily was ""unacceptable"" and a ""non-starter"" because it did not ""represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people\'s lives.""Analysts pointed out that Trump had previously rejected a deal that would have provided funding for the border wall in exchange for further protection for DACA recipients.Conversely, Republicans reacted positively to Trump\'s proposal, and Mitch McConnell said he would bring it to a vote in the Senate.\n\nDuring the shutdown, on January 8 in a press conference, a reporter asked Trump if he was considering declaring a national emergency, to which Trump replied, ""I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want"" and suggested that he could declare an emergency.After this, Trump repeatedly threatened to declare a national emergency to unilaterally order wall construction without congressional authorization.Some of Trump\'s advisors, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, reportedly attempted to dissuade him from doing so.Administration officials considered diverting hurricane-relief and wildfire-relief funds from a $13.9 billion February 2018 emergency supplemental appropriations bill (for disaster relief in Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California, among other places) in order to fund a wall, and directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to look into this possibility.\n\nAn attempt by Trump to invoke emergency powers would almost certainly have prompted a lengthy legal challenge in court.Democrats responded that Trump lacked the authority to declare a national emergency; Representative Adam Schiff called it a ""non-starter"" and said that ""if Harry Truman couldn\'t nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this President doesn\'t have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion dollar wall on the border.""Democratic Representative Nydia Velázquez said the notion of redirecting disaster-relief funds to a border wall was ""beyond appalling"".Presidents have declared emergencies in the past, but none has ""involved funding a policy goal after failing to win congressional approval"".Yale Law School professor Bruce Ackerman wrote that the declaration of a national emergency to build a wall as Trump suggested would be unconstitutional and illegal.Other scholars, such as Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice, believed that Trump could make a colorable argument that diverting military-construction appropriations for border-wall construction was legal, but that doing so would be an abuse of power.Law professor Ilya Somin stated that in the unlikely case that Trump succeeded in using the emergency powers in this way, it would set a dangerous precedent, which Republicans would come to regret next time the president was a Democrat.\n\nOn January 11, Trump—while maintaining he has the authority to do so anytime—said he was not in any rush to declare a national emergency to secure wall funding, saying he would rather see Congress ""do its job"" and that the Democrats ""should come back and vote.""The next day he again threatened to use emergency powers if Democrats did not ""come to their senses.""\n\nOn January 16, Pelosi sent a letter to Trump that indicated the House would be unavailable for the 2019 State of the Union Address that was scheduled for January 29.Pelosi wrote, ""Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government reopens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has reopened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on Jan. 29.""The delivery of the State of the Union address had been delayed or substantially changed on only two occasions since 1913.In a letter sent to the Speaker the next day, Trump said she would not be allowed to take military transport aircraft on scheduled visits to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan.Trump replied, ""We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the shutdown is over.""Pelosi and a congressional delegation had planned on visiting overseas American military personnel.\n\nOn January 23, Trump sent a letter to Pelosi insisting that there were no security concerns and that he would hold the State of the Union Address as scheduled.Trump wrote, ""Therefore, I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and Congress of the United States of America regarding the State of our Union.""In a letter sent in reply, Pelosi stated that the House would not consider a concurrent resolution to authorize the State of the Union Address in the House Chamber until the shutdown ended, writing, ""Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened.""\n\nTrump later stated he would look for an alternative, but then retracted that statement in a pair of tweets announcing that he would wait until the end of the shutdown to give the address in the House Chamber.\n\nOn January 25, Trump announced his support for a three-week funding measure that would reopen the government until February 15.The deal, which also moved forward with long-term Department of Homeland Security funding, did not include funds for a wall.As expected, the agreement provided federal employees with back pay.Both the Senate and House of Representatives passed the funding measure by voice vote, sending the resolution to the President\'s desk.Trump signed the bill the same day, ending the shutdown.\n\nLater in January, Republican senators voted unanimously against a bill to provide back pay to federal contractors.\n\nWithout legislation enacted by February 15, a new partial shutdown would have begun, three weeks after the last ended.A bipartisan group of senators and representatives reached an agreement ""in principle"" on February 11, but Trump did not say whether he would sign it.Included was $1.375 billion for 55 miles of steel border fencing.On February 13, it was reported that, against the wishes of Democratic leaders and many Republicans, Trump was blocking the provision of back pay to federal contractors who were still out of pocket from the shutdown.Both houses passed the bill February 14 with enough votes to override a veto if that happened.\n\nOn February 15, at the White House Rose Garden, Trump announced that he had signed the spending bill to keep the government open.He also declared a national emergency, hoping to get access to $8 billion to use for border security.\n\nAgencies funded by two ""minibus"" appropriations bills passed in September 2018 were not affected by the shutdown.About 380,000 federal employees were furloughed, and an additional 420,000 employees for the affected agencies were expected to work with their pay delayed until the end of the shutdown, totaling 800,000 workers affected out of 2.1 million civilian non-postal federal employees.As only about a quarter of the government was shut down, many people who are not federal employees did not fully realize the effects of the shutdown.\n\nAccording to and , these were the affected agencies:\n\nDepartment of State Department of the Treasury Department of Justice Most of the Department of the Interior Department of Agriculture Department of Commerce Department of Housing and Urban Development Department of Transportation Department of Homeland Security Some Department of Health and Human Services agencies Food and Drug Administration Indian Health Service Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Superfund Research Program Executive Office of the President Most independent agencies Judicial Branch\n\nUnaffected agencies include, according to and :\n\nDepartment of Defense Department of Labor Most of the Department of Health and Human Services Department of Energy Department of Education Department of Veterans Affairs Some Department of the Interior agencies Bureau of Reclamation Central Utah Project District of Columbia (excluding courts) Legislative Branch Social Security Administration Nuclear Regulatory Commission Appalachian Regional Commission Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board Delta Regional Authority Denali Commission Northern Border Regional Commission Southeast Crescent Regional Commission Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board American Battle Monuments Commission U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Cemeterial Expenses of the Army, including Arlington National Cemetery and Soldiers\' and Airmen\'s Home National Cemetery Armed Forces Retirement Home Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System Fund Intelligence Community Management Account Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled Corporation for National and Community Service Corporation for Public Broadcasting Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission Institute of Museum and Library Services Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission Medicare Payment Advisory Commission National Council on Disability National Labor Relations Board National Mediation Board Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission Railroad Retirement Board\n\nJobs affected included staff throughout the United States, not just DC area employees.FBI agents, federal corrections officers, FDA inspectors, NASA employees, TSA staff, Border Patrol staff and CBP officers, census staff, National Park Service staff, members of the Coast Guard, and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers either worked without pay or were furloughed, with increasing numbers of unpaid essential employees failing to show up for work.\n\nOn January 11, 800,000 workers for agencies shutdown or furloughed missed their first paycheck.Federal workers normally receive pay on federal holidays, which include Christmas, New Year\'s Day and potentially Martin Luther King Jr. Day.The shutdown affected the employees\' entitlement to paid holidays due to the shutdown.Unemployment assistance to federal workers furloughed under the government shutdown varied by locality.Only non-reporting workers were eligible for assistance, whereas furloughed workers who still reported to work were not.Workers who received unemployment assistance were required pay it back after the shut down ended and they received backpay.Some furloughed workers sought other employment opportunities while they were idled.However, external employment must meet agency-specific ethics guidelines, and mandatory reviews of external employment were also curtailed as most ethics officials were also furloughed.Federal employees were not able to use vacation or sick leave during the shutdown so scheduled holiday vacation time either became unpaid if the worker was deemed non-essential or was cancelled if the worker was deemed essential.In many cases unused leave over a certain threshold expired at year-end, but employees who had leave scheduled in advance of the shutdown did not have ""use or lose"" leave balances deducted from their accrued leave.Many furloughed employees took to crowd-funding campaigns to raise cash to replace missed paychecks, but these types of solicitations also run afoul of government ethics rules.\n\nAs furloughed federal workers and their families shared stories of their hardships, such as not being able to meet rent or mortgage payments and missed bills, the hashtag ""#ShutdownStories"" went viral on social media.The federal government\'s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) responded by publishing sample letters that employees could send to their creditors.One read, in part, ""I am a Federal employee who has recently been furloughed due to a lack of funding of my agency.Because of this, my income has been severely cut and I am unable to pay the entire cost of my mortgage, along with my other expenses.""Other federal workers reached out to other news outlets to share stories about having to stretch their budgets and the impact of the shutdown on their families.In addition to being unable to meet rent or pay bills, many federal workers around the country were unable to pay for groceries and turned to food banks.One federal prison guard in Louisiana attempted suicide after posting about the financial pressures of the shutdown on Facebook.\n\nThe OPM also suggested that employees who had landlords write: ""I would like to discuss with you the possibility of trading my services to perform maintenance (e.g. painting, carpentry work) in exchange for partial rent payments"" and suggested those who lacked funds to pay bills should hire personal attorneys to assist them.Other organizations also posted advice on how to ""find supplemental income""; the Coast Guard suggested that Coast Guard members ""have a garage sale, offer to watch children, walk pets or house sit"" while furloughed.\n\nOn January 4, The Washington Post reported that because the shutdown was triggered by the failure to enact spending bills that continued a federal government pay freeze, hundreds of senior Trump administration political appointees would receive a roughly $10,000 pay raise the following day.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the pending pay raise was an ""unnecessary byproduct of the shutdown.""\n\nOn January 10, the Senate approved by unanimous consent a bill (S.24, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019) providing that furloughed federal employees would receive back pay for the period of the furlough once appropriations were restored; the bill was approved the next day by the House on a vote of 411–7.Trump signed the bill into law on January 16.\n\nNative American tribes were not paid for treaties negotiated with the United States government.These treaties specified that the federal government must provide funding for health clinics, employee salaries, education, infrastructure and other services, which were not paid during the shutdown.Native lands are ""owned, managed and maintained by the federal government.""Native Americans who receive a per capita check for profits from oil and gas sales from tribal land did not receive check for the month of February.Roads were not plowed on tribal land, and some areas received significant snowfall.This caused people of the Navajo Nation to become trapped inside their homes.Food services, which fed 90,000 Native Americans in 2017, were halted.\n\nNative American communities had a high percentage of individuals who worked for the federal government and lost income during the shutdown.In North and South Dakota, one of the largest employers is the Indian Health Service.The Chippewa tribe reported an economic loss of nearly $100,000 daily in funds that the federal government was supposed to provide as a treaty obligation.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was closed for the shutdown.However, 60 percent of the Indian Health Service (IHS) continued to work without pay.IHS provides care for 2.2 million Native Americans and on January 23, began to deny care that was not considered ""life threatening.""The Bureau of Indian Education was able to stay open because it was funded on a different schedule.Unlike other government shutdowns, there was little outreach from the Trump Administration to Native Americans and the Chippewa tribe in Michigan was given a 24-hour notice that the shutdown would take place and affect the tribe.\n\nThe only military branch that was affected by the shutdown was the Coast Guard because it was part of the Department of Homeland Security, while the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps were all funded through the Department of Defense.Officials were able to fund payment on December 31, 2018, but were not able to do so for the paychecks of January 15 and 30, 2019, along with the pay and benefits for civilian workers and retirees.During the shutdown, the Coast Guard continued to engage in patrolling the American coastline and carrying out overseas missions in locations such as the Persian Gulf along with the Navy and in the Caribbean.Other issues arose in the payment processes for Coast Guard members Tricare Health and Dental Program payments, although the individuals were still covered.\n\nMilitary schools, such as the Coast Guard Academy and the National War College, lost funding due to the shutdown and the schools had to work to find funds to pay professors.\n\nAlthough the Department of Defense was not shut down, the February 4, 2019, date for release of the Pentagon\'s 2020 budget was delayed by at least one month.This had repercussions on the interim period which is usually used by Pentagon planners for adjustments before the 2020 fiscal year which will begin in October 2019.The White House Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the Pentagon request, was shut down when the Pentagon budget arrived in December, and remained inactive, so no work was done on the budget.\n\nOn February 25, 2019, the Pentagon\'s counter-drug (interdiction) funding has up to $85 million not yet obligated, but that money was planned for the known corridors in El Paso, Tucson, Yuma, and El Centro for border fencing, lighting, and road projects, so any funds which might possibly be intended for additional projects elsewhere along the border must be obligated by September 30, 2019, in order not to affect the known corridors.Otherwise appropriations above the $85 million not yet obligated for additional interdiction border projects will have to be approved by additional Congressional appropriations, to reach the $2 billion target.\n\nA January 28, 2019 Congressional Budget Office report estimated that the 35-day partial government shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion, including $3 billion in permanent losses; the CBO estimate excluded indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.The furloughing of 145,000 federal workers and 112,500 federal contractors in the Washington Metropolitan Area cost the regional economy $119 million each day, or 7.3% of the region\'s total output.That reduced GDP by over $2.8 billion in the Washington DC area alone.The shutdown also had a noticeable impact on hunger in the national capital region: food pantries in Washington DC and Northern Virginia reported an increase of around 10% in the number of people coming to pick up groceries, with most of that increase coming from federal workers and contractors.\n\nFitch Ratings warned that an extended shutdown might lead to a downgrade in the U.S.\'s Triple-A credit rating if lawmakers were unable to pass a budget or manage the debt ceiling.That in turn would make borrowing more costly for companies and American households, because it is the benchmark for many other lines of credit.The only time the U.S. credit rating has been downgraded by S&P was during the United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011.\n\nSome economists believed that an extended shutdown would weaken consumer confidence and heighten the risk of pushing the U.S. economy into a recession.Between 800,000 federal government employees and some 4 million federal contractors, the shutdown directly affected nearly 3% of the labor force of the United States; in a typical recession, unemployment increases 2–4%.The reduction in spending by those households combined with the reduction of government services could have macroeconomic results similar to a typical recession.The shutdown had an adverse effect on the budgets of state and local governments, as states covered some federal services (particularly the most vulnerable) during the shutdown.\n\nBy mid-January 2019, the White House Council of Economic Advisors estimated that each week of the shutdown reduced GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, the equivalent of 1.2 points per quarter.CEA chairman Kevin Hassett later acknowledged that GDP growth could decline to zero in the first quarter of 2019 if the shutdown lasted the entire quarter.\n\nAs tax season began in the United States on January 28, some 46,000 Internal Revenue Service workers were called back to work to ensure tax refunds and returns were not affected by the shutdown.The recalled workers allowed the department to continue operations that were automatic and those deemed necessary for the safety of human life or protection of government property, such as processing electronic returns, returns with payments, mailing tax forms, appeals, criminal law enforcement investigations and technical support.\n\nDuring the shutdown, 95% of federal staff for the USDA\'s Food and Nutrition Services were furloughed.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the food-stamp program, could be funded through a $3 billion contingency fund appropriated by Congress in 2018; if the shutdown had continued through March 2019, those funds would have been exhausted, leaving some 38 million Americans without food stamps and endangering food security.Concerns were raised that continuation of the shutdown could delay the issuance of some $140 billion in tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees most of the food supply in the U.S.In early January, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner, reported that the FDA suspended food inspections.He noted that inspection of foreign food was continuing as ""almost normal,"" because they are considered vital.Around January 14, ""high-risk"" food inspections resumed.As of January 22, 2019, 46 percent of the FDA were working, though 20 percent of them were working without pay.During the shutdown, two new recalls for contamination with Listeria or Salmonella took place.Consumer advocacy groups advised of food safety issues during the shutdown.Food safety attorney, Bill Marler, advocated against eating ""fresh, uncooked products on the market place.""Because there was a shortage of FDA inspectors, many imported perishable items, such as produce or flowers, were at risk of spoilage.Meat and some egg products are inspected by the USDA\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service.Federal legislation required those inspectors to remain working without pay.\n\nSchool administrations raised concern about how to feed children who purchase food at the schools for lunch, as funding concerns caused some districts to conserve food and funding.Many limited the amount or variation of foods available for the children to purchase, and alerted parents to the concerns and the limited availability of some of the items.Most schools affected were in high-poverty areas, and depended on federally funded lunch programs, such as the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) a federal grant established by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 and operated through the Department of Agriculture.Some 22 million students in nearly 100,000 schools received school meals through that operation.\n\nAs with the January 2018 shutdown, national parks were expected to be open to the extent practical, though there would be no staff and buildings would be closed.The shutdown affected national parks unevenly, some were accessible with bare-bones staffing levels, some operated with money from states or charitable groups, and others were locked off.Diane Regas, president and chief executive of the Trust for Public Land, called upon Trump to close all national parks to protect the public: by the third week of the shutdown, three people had died in national parks.This number was reported as being within \'usual\' levels.At Yosemite National Park, on January 4, 2019, a death from a fall went unreported for a week.\n\nBy January 1, 2019, the problems of neglected trash pileup, overflowing public toilets, and access to first aid were repeated across the Park system.Health and safety concerns were raised, with concerns by scientists that the expansive amount of garbage and human waste could impact water and soil quality, or cause damage to animals in the parks.Other issues that arose due to the shutdown included illegal campsites, protected agriculture being damaged, damaging of government property and trespassing on foot and by vehicle.\n\nNew York kept the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open, as it did during the January 2018 shutdown.Arizona and Utah were able to keep Grand Canyon National Park, Zion National Park, Arches National Park, and Bryce Canyon National Park open and provided services including public restrooms, shuttles and trash collection.Utah\'s funding included visitor centers.The sites closed outright in the southwest alone included Bandelier National Monument and Valles Caldera National Preserve in northern New Mexico, White Sands National Monument in southern New Mexico, Petrified Forest National Park in northern Arizona and Casa Grande Ruins National Monument in south-central Arizona.Access to major parts of Sequoia and Kings Canyon parks were closed, and at Joshua Tree National Park, the administration policy of leaving parks open to visitors despite the staff furloughs resulted in park damage, including the toppling of protected trees.In Texas, Big Bend National Park had no visitor services, such as restrooms.Some trailheads were closed.Regulations continued to be enforced, as the park remained open.Visitors were reminded to remove their own trash and toilet paper.The Alamo remained open but no NPS services were available at the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park.Channel Islands National Park remained open to public access, although services normally provided by the national park service were instead provided by Island Packers Cruises, the company normally in charge of ferries to the islands.\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration closed immediately on December 22, 2018.The Library of Congress, the U.S. Botanic Garden, the Capitol Visitor Center, and the U.S. Capitol Building remained open as they were funded by the 2019 Legislative Branch appropriations bill.The Smithsonian Institution operated on ""prior-year funds"" through January 1, 2019.On January 2, 2019, the Smithsonian Institution initiated an orderly shutdown of all its facilities, including 19 museums in Washington, D.C., and New York City, the National Zoo, and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.The following day, the National Gallery of Art was closed.The National Zoo also closed on January 3, 2019.Tourism attendance on the National Mall was affected.On January 5, 2019, acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt directed the diversion of fee revenue defined by the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to be used to fund minimal maintenance activities so as to preserve access to highly visited parks.\n\nAccording to a January 12, 2019, article in The Economist, on January 11, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was unable to pay its workers who had not been paid since December 22; 55% more of them called in sick than in January 2018.\n\nAs the air traffic controllers were deemed essential employees, they were required to work without pay.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents air traffic controllers, filed a lawsuit against the federal government for the shutdown on January 11, 2019, claiming that requiring 16,000 air traffic controllers to work without being paid violated their constitutional rights and federal minimum wage law.That was the third lawsuit filed against the federal government since the beginning of the shutdown.\n\nAirline and aircraft safety inspectors, on the other hand, were deemed nonessential and furloughed.A news report on January 12, 2019, stated that the Federal Aviation Administration had returned 500 furloughed safety inspectors back to work and would return more to work in the following weeks.As the airline and aircraft safety inspectors were furloughed, the certification process of the Airbus A220 in the US was stalled.Delta Air Lines was forced to delay the launch of the new aircraft, and to use other models of aircraft to serve those routes that was supposed to be served with A220.Many TSA employees also called out sick, most of them because they were trying to find other jobs that would provide immediate paychecks.\n\nThe shutdown initially prevented the National Transportation Safety Board from assisting the Mexican government\'s investigation of the 2018 Puebla helicopter crash that killed a state governor and senator; an exception allowed the NTSB to assist with the Mexican government in the investigation along with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.The NTSB also had to delay several investigations until the government reopened and only continued investigations into accidents that were considered the most serious.Issues in receiving certification and oversight from the FAA led to a month-long delay in the commencement of passenger service at Paine Field in Everett, Washington.\n\nAs the shutdown continued into its fourth week, the unions representing airline pilots, flight attendants and air traffic controllers issued a statement asserting, ""we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play"" because of the shutdown.\n\nSome airports such as the Philadelphia International Airport, launched food and item donations for federal employees who were affected by the shutdown.Other airports such as the Miami International Airport, and the George Bush International Airport, closed down terminals in order to spread out the TSA workers that were available.\n\nOn January 25, flights destined for LaGuardia Airport in New York were halted to a groundstop by FAA officials due to staffing shortages directly as a result of the shutdown.As a result, several flights to and from neighboring airports in the Northeast, specifically Philadelphia and Newark, suffered significant delays of their own.Soon after that, appropriations passed and the government reopened.\n\nThe shutdown delayed software updates to the Boeing 737 MAX airplane which may have caused the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.\n\nDuring the shutdown, court-appointed private lawyers who represent indigent defendants worked without pay.The Federal Judiciary initially had a goal of sustaining paid operations through January 18, 2019.It said it would run out of money to sustain court operations no earlier than January 25, but perhaps as late as February 1.Failing funding, the Judiciary would operate under the terms of the Antideficiency Act.This Act does not allow federal agencies to expend federal funds before an appropriation, nor to accept any voluntary services.The judiciary had 33,000 employees nationwide.Under the Constitution, Supreme Court Justices, appeals court judges and district judges would continue to be paid.\n\nThe shutdown caused many delays and disruptions in cases.Budgets were watched carefully to be able to pay public defenders, DNA testing, informants, and travel costs to interview victims and witnesses.Staffing issues also brought about concerns and constraints with prisons lacking the staff to safely hold attorney-client visits, and caused a delay in bail hearings.\n\nAgents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed in a report released on January 22, 2019, by the FBI Agents Association, that several different investigations were compromised by the shutdown.The report was called ""Voices from the Field"" and was 72 pages long.FBI agents were unable to pay Confidential Human Sources which risks losing that informant permanently.Some FBI divisions no longer have Spanish-speaking staff on hand and could not work with informants who only speak Spanish.Some agents reported that they did not have the funds to assist in joint operations with local law enforcement.\n\nFederal law enforcement agencies working on Native American land worked without pay through the shutdown.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was forced to cancel a trip to the United States/Mexico border in early January due to the shutdown.DHS was also unable to inspect Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities during the shutdown to ensure that immigrants were being held in facilities appropriately.During the shutdown, the federal government\'s e-Verify system—a system for employers to check the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States—was halted.\n\nDuring the shutdown, a wave of Domain Name System (DNS) attacks on government sites was detected by Homeland Security.The attacks were serious because these Internet sites could be hijacked.\n\nOfficial websites for agencies were rendered insecure or inaccessible through the shutdown, as the expired digital certificates were not renewed.On January 23, DHS asked all government agencies to secure their DNS records; however, many agencies were not able to respond quickly to this request.\n\nExecutive and legislative affairs of the local government of the District of Columbia continued operating through the shutdown, due to a provision previously enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017.The District\'s local court system, including the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, are part of the federal judiciary.Thus, they were partially shut down, preventing District residents from accessing services such as marriage licensing.The District of Columbia government said it would take over trash collection and snow plowing operations for National Park Service facilities in Washington.\n\nThe shutdown also interfered with the response to the 2018 Sunda Strait tsunami, as the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta\'s Twitter account was unable to tweet updates, and the United States Geological Survey was unable to provide data on the tsunami.The American weather model, the GFS, suffered a significant drop in forecast quality when a data format change during the shutdown prevented certain weather data from being recognized by the GFS, and the shutdown prevented the bug from being corrected.\n\nBy mid-day Thursday, January 3, 2019, the FCC had suspended operations.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai canceled his trip to the Consumer Electronics Show.The FTC also suspended certain online operations.The EPA and Department of Energy\'s Energy Star website was not available for the duration of the shutdown.\n\nMakers of alcoholic beverages were unable to receive approval from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau for new labels and recipes during the shutdown.\n\nBased on the recalculation of their operating reserves, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) would have had to cease patent operations in the second week of February.A cadre of personnel was allocated to continue receiving patent applications, receive payments, and maintain the IT infrastructure.Even though the USPTO is self-funded, a Congressional appropriation is required to permit the USPTO to spend money.The pipeline of patent applications at the time took 15.8 months for a response from an examiner.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution shortened to two days and downscaled its scheduled ten-day 2019 Folklife Festival on the National Mall because of the shutdown\'s effects.Sabrina Motley, the director of the festival, said that initially, crucial funding for the June—July event arrived later than expected, slowing preparations.Motley stated: ""The government opened back up, but it took a while for systems to come back online. ...We looked at our production schedule, and it became clear we would need more time than we had.""\n\nThe White House residence staff who stage public receptions were among those furloughed, with a minimal staff continuing to work unpaid for the first family.In the midst of the shutdown Trump invited the Clemson Tigers football team to a White House dinner reception on January 14 in recognition of their College Football Playoff National Championship win.On the morning of the reception Trump announced that he intended to serve fast food hamburgers and pizza to the team, a remark that some commentators interpreted as a joke.That evening Trump welcomed the team in the State Dining Room with a buffet of fast food and pizza from McDonald\'s, Wendy\'s and other restaurant chains, which he stated that he had paid for personally.Trump served fast food to other visiting athletes later that year, after the shutdown had ended.\n\nOn January 10, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with several other unions, announced plans to protest the government shutdown at 1:00pm EST in Washington, DC.Leaders of the National Federation of Federal Employees stated they had hoped that bringing federal workers to the President\'s doorstep would show him that it was the individual workers that the shutdown was hurting the most.President Trump had left to visit the US–Mexican border in Texas earlier in the day.\n\nSimilar protests took place in Philadelphia and St. Louis, among other cities.On January 15, representatives for Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, and Vietnam Veterans of America along with others called for an end to shutdown, but avoided placing any blame on political parties.\n\nShortly after the protests, the American Federation of Government Employees sued the Trump administration to challenge the arrangements for work without pay during the shutdown.A similar suit was raised and won during the 2013 Federal Government shutdown.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association also sued the Trump administration, as the shutdown allegedly violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by failing to pay the workers at least a minimum wage during the shutdown.\n\nAs the salaries for members of Congress are written into permanent law and not funded through annual appropriations, the government shutdown did not affect their salaries.Senators and Representatives were still paid their biweekly salaries of $6,700 towards at least $174,000 a year.\n\nSeveral Democratic and Republican Senators and Representatives said they would donate or refuse their salary during the shutdown.Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw stated that he would refuse his salary, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto indicated she would donate hers to a Nevada charity, Senator Mazie Hirono said she would donate her salary to Hawaii food banks, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would give hers to refugee non-profit HIAS, New York Congressman Max Rose stated that he would give his salary to charity and outgoing Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota pledged hers to charity, along with her Republican colleague John Hoeven.Republican senator Kevin Cramer, who defeated Heidi Heitkamp in the 2018 midterm elections, refused to donate his salary, calling the move ""gimmicky"".Representative Brian Fitzpatrick urged all members of Congress to decline their paychecks.He said, ""If you\'re in Congress, don\'t just delay your pay -- forfeit it, write a check back to the US Treasury.Then you\'ll feel the pain of federal workers.""\n\nBy January 17, 2019, 102 members of Congress—20 Senators and 82 Representatives— chose to decline their paychecks or were donating their paychecks to charity.\n\nDuring the shutdown, many federal workers used food banks and food pantries in order to feed themselves and their families.Many food pantries waived certain restrictions in order to help government workers have access to food.During the shutdown, the Salvation Army Emergency Disasters Services program provided meals for federal workers.Chef Jose Andres created the #ChefsForFeds program to feed federal workers in Washington, D.C. and by January 21, made announcements to expand the program nationwide.\n\nSome states such as California, offered furloughed employees unemployment benefits, although the Trump administration allegedly told states that they could not do so with federal funds.Organizations such as state Attorney Generals offices, and credit card companies posted statements to their websites to offer a means to help to consolidate debt, meet mortgages or other payments such as child support or tuition.An employment law firm offered pro bono legal advice to furloughed federal employees.School districts opened up free or reduced lunch options for children of federal employees, and looked into other options to aid parents amid concerns that financial stress at home would adversely affect families and children.Every mainline denomination in America has contributed to efforts to provide relief.One Baptist church emptied its entire disaster fund to aid federal employees.\n\nOn January 24, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross downplayed the financial difficulties faced by the 800,000 federal workers affected by the shutdown, stating that they should borrow money to ""tide them over"" until the shutdown ends.Critics and Democrats criticized the statement as inappropriate, noting that Ross\' own net worth is estimated at almost $700 million, accusing him of being out of touch with the workers.Ross also said that he ""did not understand"" why people who were not getting paid due to the shutdown were visiting food banks.When asked about Ross\' statement, Trump suggested that grocery stores will ""work along"" with the government by voluntarily extending credit to those who are out of funds to buy food.National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow characterized the shutdown as a ""glitch"" and suggested that federal workers who were required to work without pay were ""volunteering"" to work for their love of the country and ""presumably their allegiance to President Trump.""\n\nIn a video message to staff, FBI director Christopher Wray stated, ""Making some people stay home when they don\'t want to, and making others show up without pay, it\'s mind-boggling, it\'s shortsighted and it\'s unfair.It takes a lot to get me angry, but I\'m about as angry as I\'ve been in a long, long time.""\n\nLara Trump, a daughter-in-law of the President, drew outrage after an interview in which she stated that while ""It\'s not fair to you..."" the shutdown was ""...a little bit of pain, but it\'s going to be for the future of our country, and their children and their grandchildren and generations after them will thank them for their sacrifice right now.""Her comments drew criticism by politicians, celebrities, and the general public who felt the advisor and spokeswoman for the Trump 2020 campaign was out of touch, however Lara Trump later claimed the comments were taken out of context.\n\nIn January 2019, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that 56% of the responding public opposed a wall while 39% favored it, and 45% viewed the situation at the border as a crisis.The numbers were similar to the poll in December 2018 yet a later poll by ABC News showed that as the partial shutdown entered its fourth week support for building a wall was increasing.A poll done through YouGov between December 23–25, 2018, reported that 51% of respondents thought Trump deserved ""a lot"" of the blame, 44% thought congressional Democrats and 39% thought congressional Republicans.Similar results were reported by a December 21–25 survey done by Reuters and Ipsos in which 47% of respondents said that the shutdown was the President\'s fault and 33% blamed Congressional Democrats.\n\nOver the course of the shutdown, Trump\'s approval rating marginally declined while his disapproval rating marginally increased.His net approval rating was by the middle of January 2019 at its lowest point since February 2018.On December 27, 2018, it was reported that Trump\'s approval rating of registered voters was at 39%, with 56% disapproval.Broken down the rating was split across party lines, with Republicans reporting an 80% approval rate while Democrats and independents reported a 90% and 57% disapproval rating, respectively.The poll was conducted through Morning Consult between December 21–23.The poll also reported that 43% of respondents blamed Trump for the shutdown, with 31% blaming congressional Democrats and 7% congressional Republicans.Another poll through The New York Times Upshot/Siena College reported that 89% of voters\' views on Trump and the wall were aligned, suggesting that support for the wall was a function of support for Trump.\n\nThe Washington Post–ABC News poll published on January 13, 2019, found that a larger number of Americans blamed Trump and congressional Republicans than congressional Democrats for the shutdown.A PBS NewsHour–Marist poll found that on January 15, 2019, a majority of Americans thought that President Trump was to blame for the shutdown.A January 2019 poll conducted by telephone for CBS News found that 70% of Americans polled did not want a government shutdown over the issue of building a border wall; 66% believed that Trump should agree to a budget without wall funding.\n\nPresidency of Donald Trump Donald Trump January 2018 United

57,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018–2019 United States federal government shutdown', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The United States federal government shutdown from midnight EST on December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019 (35 days) was the longest government shutdown in history and the second and final federal government shutdown involving furloughs during the presidency of Donald Trump.It occurred when the 115th Congress and Trump could not agree on an appropriations bill to fund the operations of the federal government for the 2019 fiscal year, or a temporary continuing resolution that would extend the deadline for passing a bill.The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal departments or agencies from conducting non-essential operations without appropriations legislation in place.As a result, nine executive departments with around 800,000 employees had to shut down partially or in full, affecting about one-fourth of government activities and causing employees to be furloughed or required to work without being paid.The Congressional Budget Office estimated the shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion USD, excluding indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.\n\nThe shutdown stemmed from an impasse over Trump\'s demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall.In December 2018, the Senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the bill appeared likely to be approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Trump.After Trump faced heavy criticism from some right-wing media outlets and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to ""build the wall"", he announced that he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund its construction.As a result, the House passed a stopgap bill with funding for the wall, but it was blocked in the Senate by the threat of a Democratic filibuster.\n\nIn January 2019, representatives elected in the November 2018 election took office, giving the Democrats a majority in the House.The House immediately voted to approve the appropriations bill that had previously passed the Senate unanimously (which included no funding for the wall).For several weeks, Trump continued to maintain that he would veto any bill that did not fund an entire border wall, and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the Senate from considering any appropriations legislation that Trump would not support, including the bill that had previously passed.Democrats and some Republicans opposed the shutdown and passed multiple bills to reopen the government, arguing that the government shutdown amounted to ""hostage-taking"" civil servants and that negotiations could only begin once the government was reopened.\n\nOn January 25, 2019, Trump agreed to endorse a stopgap bill to reopen the government for three weeks up until February 15 to allow for negotiations to take place to approve an appropriations bill that both parties could agree on.However, Trump reiterated his demand for the border wall funding and said that he would shut down the government again or declare a national emergency and use military funding to build the wall if Congress did not appropriate the funds by February 15.\n\nTrump\'s approval rating dropped during the shutdown.A majority of Americans opposed exploitation of the shutdown as a negotiating strategy and held Trump responsible for the shutdown: A CBS News poll found that 71% of Americans considered the border wall ""not worth the shutdown"" and a Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 53% of Americans blamed Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, compared to 34% who blamed Democrats and 10% who blamed both parties.\n\nOn February 15, 2019, Trump declared a national emergency to fund the wall and bypass Congress, after being unsatisfied with a bipartisan border bill that had passed the House and the Senate a day before.\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign, then-candidate Trump promised to build a wall along the Mexico–United States border for which Mexico would pay.The president of Mexico rejected the idea of providing any funding for a U.S. border wall.In 2018, Trump requested $ in federal funding for some of barrier on the border, mostly to replace of aging fence built under the Secure Fence Act of 2006.On December 25, 2018, Trump reversed course, suggesting that he might accept of either mostly refurbished barrier (rather than new barriers in locations that did not previously have them) by November 2020.Trump\'s proposals and public statements on the wall have shifted widely over time, with varied proposals as to the design, material, length, height, and width of a wall.\n\nIn September 2018, Congress passed two ""minibus"" appropriations bills for the 2019 United States federal budget, which began on October 1, 2018.These bills combined five of the 12 regular appropriations bills covering 77% of federal discretionary funding, and included a continuing resolution until December 7 for the remaining agencies.On December 6, Congress passed a second continuing resolution to December 21, to give more time for negotiations on Trump\'s proposed border wall, which had been delayed due to the funeral of George H. W. Bush.\n\nA Senate Homeland Security appropriations bill, negotiated by both parties and reported by the committee to the Senate, provided for $ for border security, including funds for ""approximately 65 miles of pedestrian fencing along the southwest border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector"".The bill did not receive a vote on the Senate floor, although House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer indicated that such a proposal could be acceptable to House Democrats.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said the Democratic Party would not support $ for the border wall.At a press conference before the government shutdown, he noted ""the $1.6 billion for border security negotiated by Democrats and Republicans is our position.We believe that is the right way to go.""\n\nOn December 11, President Trump held a televised meeting with Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in the Oval Office and asked them to support an appropriation of $5.7 billion for funding of a border wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico.They refused, resulting in an argument between Trump and both Congressional leaders.During the contentious discussion, Trump remarked, ""I am proud to shut down the government for border security ...I will be the one to shut [the government] down.I\'m not going to blame you for it ...I will take the mantle.I will be the one to shut it down.""Schumer replied, ""We shouldn\'t shut down the government over a dispute.""Ten days later, Trump blamed Democrats for the impending shutdown.\n\nThree days later, Politico reported that Trump was willing to sign a bill with no funding for a border wall that delayed a government shutdown into 2019 and the new Congress.On December 18, following a meeting with Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the government would not shut down on December 22 and that Trump was ""flexible"" over funding for a border wall.Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby commented that the most likely resolution was a bill that funded the government until early February.Schumer added that his caucus would ""very seriously"" consider such a bill and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said ""I don\'t know anybody on the Hill that wants a shutdown, and I think all the president\'s advisers are telling him this would not be good.""\n\nOn December 19, the Senate passed a second continuing resolution () that would fund the government until February 8, 2019.Pelosi announced that House Democrats would support the measure, meaning it would overcome opposition from conservative Republicans and pass the House.On December 20, following increased criticism from conservative media, pundits, and political figures, Trump reversed his position and declared that he would not sign any funding bill that did not include border wall funding.The same day, the House passed a continuing resolution that included $5 billion for the wall and $8 billion in disaster aid.This bill failed in the Senate.Trump\'s changing position caused consternation among Senate Republicans.\n\nThe shutdown started December 22 and Trump announced that he would cancel his planned trip to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas and stay in Washington, D.C.The meaning of the term ""wall"" was expected to be an aspect of the negotiations.\n\nCongress adjourned on December 22 for the Christmas and holiday season, with many predicting that the shutdown would not be resolved until the start of the 116th Congress.The Senate reconvened on December 27 for four minutes, with Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) presiding over the session.The House briefly reconvened as well, with Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) saying that members should not expect any further votes for the rest of 2018.Representative Jim McGovern (D-MA) went to the House floor to try to force consideration of a short-term funding bill to end the shutdown that the Senate had already passed, but the Republican Speaker-pro-tem refused to let him speak.\n\nCongress then adjourned again until December 31, 2018, for a pro forma session.On January 2, 2019, the last full day of the 115th United States Congress, there was a pro forma session scheduled to last several minutes.\n\nThe new Congress was sworn in on January 3, 2019, and one of the first orders of business in the House after electing the Speaker and swearing in the new members was a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security until February 8 (), which passed by a vote of 239–192; and a package combining five appropriation bills funding the rest of the government for the remainder of the fiscal year (), passed by a vote of 241–190.The bills contained $1.3 billion of funding for border security, but no additional funding for a border wall.\n\nBeginning on January 9, the Democratic-controlled House voted on four appropriations bills individually:\n\nFinancial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Treasury (including the Internal Revenue Service), federal judiciary, District of Columbia, and a number of independent agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, General Services Administration, and Securities and Exchange Commission.The House passed the legislation on January 9, on a 240–188 vote, with every Democrat and eight Republicans voting yes, and all other Republicans voting no. Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Department of Agriculture (including food stamps), the Food and Drug Administration, and related entities.On January 10, the House passed this bill 243–183.Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore Transportation and Housing and Urban Development (including some federal mortgage programs).On January 10, the House passed this bill 244–180.Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Interior Department, Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies, including the Smithsonian Institution.On January 11, ten House Republicans voted with Democrats in a 240–179 vote to end the shutdown of Interior-Environment programs.It was the most recent of a ""series of standalone appropriations measures"" the House sent to the Senate.\n\nThis strategy has been compared to one used by Republicans during the 2013 shutdown in the form of a series of fourteen mini-continuing resolutions.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed that the Senate would not consider the House bills to reopen the government, indicating that Senate Republicans would not support any bill unless it had Trump\'s support.In January 2019, McConnell and Senate Republicans came under increased pressure to break the impasse and reopen the government.Three Republican Senators—Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Cory Gardner of Colorado—called for an end to the shutdown.Senators Collins and Gardner said they supported the House\'s budget bills to end the shutdown.West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito said that she could support ending the shutdown provided border wall talks continued.Pat Roberts of Kansas said that shutdowns ""never work"" and only turned affected federal workers into ""pawns"" and that, although the time had not yet come for Senate Republicans to override any possible Trump veto and end the shutdown, ""we\'re getting pretty close.""Johnny Isakson of Georgia echoed that sentiment, saying that support for McConnell\'s refusal to support bills that do not include funding for a wall would not last indefinitely: ""There\'s a time when that may run out.""\n\nOn January 16, McConnell again blocked the House appropriation bills to reopen the government from being considered on the Senate floor.The following day, McConnell blocked consideration of bills to reopen most of the closed government agencies for a third time.On January 23, McConnell blocked a bill to reopen most of the government for the fourth time.\n\nOn January 22, McConnell stated that the Senate would be voting on two different bills to end the shutdown on January 24.The first vote is on a bill to reopen the government which includes Trump\'s proposal to provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and temporary protections to some immigration classes.The other bill is a three-week continuing resolution to fund 25% of the government through February 8.\n\nOn January 22, Senator Mark Warner introduced a bill to keep the federal government running in the event of future shutdown events.The bill is called the ""Stop Shutdowns Transferring Unnecessary Pain and Inflicting Damage in the Coming Years Act"" or the ""Stop STUPIDITY Act"".\n\nOn January 24, the Senate held two votes on competing Democratic and Republican proposals to end the shutdown.The Democratic proposal was largely similar to the measure that had previously passed the Senate unanimously in the 115th Congress, and then been passed by the Democratic-controlled House in the 116th Congress.It provided funding for the government with no money for the border wall.The Republican proposal incorporated Trump\'s proposal, which would fund a border wall; temporarily extend TPS and DACA for three years, but would substantially narrow eligibility for DACA; and make significant legal changes to make it more difficult for persons escaping violence and persecution to be granted asylum in the United States.Neither proposal was able to attain the 60 votes needed for passage.The Trump plan failed in a 50–47 vote.The Democratic plan failed in a 52–44 vote.Most Republicans voted for Trump\'s plan and against the Democratic plan.Most Democrats voted for the Democratic plan and against Trump\'s plan.Republicans Tom Cotton and Mike Lee voted against both plans.Democrat Joe Manchin and Republicans Lamar Alexander, Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, Johnny Isakson, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney voted for both plans.Not voting on either were Republicans Rand Paul and Jim Risch and Democrat Jacky Rosen.Republican Richard Burr voted for Trump\'s plan and did not vote on the Democratic plan.\n\nOn January 25, House Democrats prepared a compromise proposal to reopen the government, which would provide $5 billion for border security but no wall construction.However, the shutdown ended the same day.\n\nOn January 4, after the new Congress was sworn-in and Pelosi regained the speakership, she and Schumer, as well as congressional Republican leadership met with Trump at the White House.Pelosi and Schumer argued that the shutdown needed to end and reported that Trump refused.They said that Trump threatened to ""keep the government closed for a very long period of time.Months or even years.""Later that day, Trump admitted to ""absolutely"" making that threat, adding, ""I\'m very proud of doing what I\'m doing.""Trump then said that he was considering declaring a national emergency to use military funding for the wall.At the meeting, Trump reprimanded his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney for attempting to propose a compromise between Trump\'s $5.7 billion demand for a border wall and the Democrats\' proposal of $1.3 billion for border security.\n\nTrump addressed the nation from the Oval Office at 9 p.m. EST on January 8, in a nationally televised address broadcast on both network and cable television.In his speech, Trump asserted that there was a ""growing humanitarian and security crisis"" on the Mexico–United States border that could only be solved by appropriating $5.7 billion for construction of a steel wall.Trump did not make any new proposals in his speech to break the impasse.Immediately after Trump\'s speech, Schumer and Pelosi delivered a response on behalf of the Democrats, in which they demanded an end to the shutdown and said: ""President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government.""\n\nTrump met with congressional leadership again on January 9, in a meeting lasting 14 minutes.Trump asked Pelosi, ""Will you agree to my wall?"" and when she replied that she would not, Trump said ""bye-bye"" and walked out of the meeting, later declaring it ""a total waste of time"".Schumer accused Trump of throwing a ""temper tantrum"" and slamming his hands on the table.Trump rebuked Schumer\'s comments on Twitter.Vice President Mike Pence and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that Trump remained calm and never raised his voice.On January 10, Pelosi described the preceding day\'s meeting with Trump as ""a setup"" staged by White House aides so that Trump could walk out of the meeting.Pelosi described Trump as ""un-presidential""; accused him of ""exploiting this situation in a way that enhances his power""; and said: ""I don\'t think he really wants a solution.I think he loves the distraction.""\n\nAfter Trump walked out of the January 9 meeting with congressional Democratic leaders, no further negotiations were conducted.Several Republican senators met in the office of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, after the meeting to discuss a compromise to end the shutdown.They discussed agreeing to Trump\'s demand for border wall funding and offering the Democrats help for Dreamers, refugee protections and extensions to H-2B visas.On January 13, Graham proposed that Trump agree to a congressional vote to reopen the government pending the resumption of negotiations.Graham suggested that if Trump and congressional Democrats did not come to an agreement at that time, Trump could declare a national emergency.Trump rejected this proposal the next day.\n\nOn January 19, Trump proposed a temporary extension of the two programs that protect about 700,000 immigrants from deportation—Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)—in exchange for funding for the border wall.The protections would be temporary, with no path to citizenship.Trump had previously revoked TPS for people from a number of Latin American and African countries, and taken steps to rescind DACA.In his remarks at the White House, Trump referred to a ""barrier"" rather than a ""wall"" and indicated that he aimed to erect ""steel barriers in high priority locations"" rather than ""a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea.""\n\nIn addition to funding a border wall, the 1,300-page Republican bill released after Trump made his proposal would make major changes to U.S. immigration policy (which were not included in Trump\'s public announcement).The legislation would severely restrict the ability of children from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to apply for asylum in the United States.Specifically, participation in the Central American Minors Program would be subject to an annual cap and migrant children would be barred from applying for asylum in person at the border, and only migrant children with a ""qualified"" parent in the U.S. would be eligible to apply.The bill would also create a new, more burdensome application process for TPS holders, and would exclude TPS holders from Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen.The American Immigration Lawyers Association government relations director said that the proposal ""would categorically block tens of thousands of children from ever applying for asylum,"" while a Cato Institute immigration analyst wrote that the proposal would not extend DACA, but rather replace it with ""a totally different program that will exclude untold thousands of Dreamers who would have been eligible under DACA.""\n\nDemocrats rejected Trump\'s proposal.In a speech on the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""The president\'s proposal is one-sided, harshly partisan and was made in bad faith.The asylum changes are a poison pill, if there ever was one.""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said extending the DACA proposal temporarily was ""unacceptable"" and a ""non-starter"" because it did not ""represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people\'s lives.""Analysts pointed out that Trump had previously rejected a deal that would have provided funding for the border wall in exchange for further protection for DACA recipients.Conversely, Republicans reacted positively to Trump\'s proposal, and Mitch McConnell said he would bring it to a vote in the Senate.\n\nDuring the shutdown, on January 8 in a press conference, a reporter asked Trump if he was considering declaring a national emergency, to which Trump replied, ""I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want"" and suggested that he could declare an emergency.After this, Trump repeatedly threatened to declare a national emergency to unilaterally order wall construction without congressional authorization.Some of Trump\'s advisors, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, reportedly attempted to dissuade him from doing so.Administration officials considered diverting hurricane-relief and wildfire-relief funds from a $13.9 billion February 2018 emergency supplemental appropriations bill (for disaster relief in Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California, among other places) in order to fund a wall, and directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to look into this possibility.\n\nAn attempt by Trump to invoke emergency powers would almost certainly have prompted a lengthy legal challenge in court.Democrats responded that Trump lacked the authority to declare a national emergency; Representative Adam Schiff called it a ""non-starter"" and said that ""if Harry Truman couldn\'t nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this President doesn\'t have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion dollar wall on the border.""Democratic Representative Nydia Velázquez said the notion of redirecting disaster-relief funds to a border wall was ""beyond appalling"".Presidents have declared emergencies in the past, but none has ""involved funding a policy goal after failing to win congressional approval"".Yale Law School professor Bruce Ackerman wrote that the declaration of a national emergency to build a wall as Trump suggested would be unconstitutional and illegal.Other scholars, such as Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice, believed that Trump could make a colorable argument that diverting military-construction appropriations for border-wall construction was legal, but that doing so would be an abuse of power.Law professor Ilya Somin stated that in the unlikely case that Trump succeeded in using the emergency powers in this way, it would set a dangerous precedent, which Republicans would come to regret next time the president was a Democrat.\n\nOn January 11, Trump—while maintaining he has the authority to do so anytime—said he was not in any rush to declare a national emergency to secure wall funding, saying he would rather see Congress ""do its job"" and that the Democrats ""should come back and vote.""The next day he again threatened to use emergency powers if Democrats did not ""come to their senses.""\n\nOn January 16, Pelosi sent a letter to Trump that indicated the House would be unavailable for the 2019 State of the Union Address that was scheduled for January 29.Pelosi wrote, ""Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government reopens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has reopened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on Jan. 29.""The delivery of the State of the Union address had been delayed or substantially changed on only two occasions since 1913.In a letter sent to the Speaker the next day, Trump said she would not be allowed to take military transport aircraft on scheduled visits to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan.Trump replied, ""We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the shutdown is over.""Pelosi and a congressional delegation had planned on visiting overseas American military personnel.\n\nOn January 23, Trump sent a letter to Pelosi insisting that there were no security concerns and that he would hold the State of the Union Address as scheduled.Trump wrote, ""Therefore, I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and Congress of the United States of America regarding the State of our Union.""In a letter sent in reply, Pelosi stated that the House would not consider a concurrent resolution to authorize the State of the Union Address in the House Chamber until the shutdown ended, writing, ""Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened.""\n\nTrump later stated he would look for an alternative, but then retracted that statement in a pair of tweets announcing that he would wait until the end of the shutdown to give the address in the House Chamber.\n\nOn January 25, Trump announced his support for a three-week funding measure that would reopen the government until February 15.The deal, which also moved forward with long-term Department of Homeland Security funding, did not include funds for a wall.As expected, the agreement provided federal employees with back pay.Both the Senate and House of Representatives passed the funding measure by voice vote, sending the resolution to the President\'s desk.Trump signed the bill the same day, ending the shutdown.\n\nLater in January, Republican senators voted unanimously against a bill to provide back pay to federal contractors.\n\nWithout legislation enacted by February 15, a new partial shutdown would have begun, three weeks after the last ended.A bipartisan group of senators and representatives reached an agreement ""in principle"" on February 11, but Trump did not say whether he would sign it.Included was $1.375 billion for 55 miles of steel border fencing.On February 13, it was reported that, against the wishes of Democratic leaders and many Republicans, Trump was blocking the provision of back pay to federal contractors who were still out of pocket from the shutdown.Both houses passed the bill February 14 with enough votes to override a veto if that happened.\n\nOn February 15, at the White House Rose Garden, Trump announced that he had signed the spending bill to keep the government open.He also declared a national emergency, hoping to get access to $8 billion to use for border security.\n\nAgencies funded by two ""minibus"" appropriations bills passed in September 2018 were not affected by the shutdown.About 380,000 federal employees were furloughed, and an additional 420,000 employees for the affected agencies were expected to work with their pay delayed until the end of the shutdown, totaling 800,000 workers affected out of 2.1 million civilian non-postal federal employees.As only about a quarter of the government was shut down, many people who are not federal employees did not fully realize the effects of the shutdown.\n\nAccording to and , these were the affected agencies:\n\nDepartment of State Department of the Treasury Department of Justice Most of the Department of the Interior Department of Agriculture Department of Commerce Department of Housing and Urban Development Department of Transportation Department of Homeland Security Some Department of Health and Human Services agencies Food and Drug Administration Indian Health Service Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Superfund Research Program Executive Office of the President Most independent agencies Judicial Branch\n\nUnaffected agencies include, according to and :\n\nDepartment of Defense Department of Labor Most of the Department of Health and Human Services Department of Energy Department of Education Department of Veterans Affairs Some Department of the Interior agencies Bureau of Reclamation Central Utah Project District of Columbia (excluding courts) Legislative Branch Social Security Administration Nuclear Regulatory Commission Appalachian Regional Commission Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board Delta Regional Authority Denali Commission Northern Border Regional Commission Southeast Crescent Regional Commission Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board American Battle Monuments Commission U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Cemeterial Expenses of the Army, including Arlington National Cemetery and Soldiers\' and Airmen\'s Home National Cemetery Armed Forces Retirement Home Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System Fund Intelligence Community Management Account Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled Corporation for National and Community Service Corporation for Public Broadcasting Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission Institute of Museum and Library Services Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission Medicare Payment Advisory Commission National Council on Disability National Labor Relations Board National Mediation Board Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission Railroad Retirement Board\n\nJobs affected included staff throughout the United States, not just DC area employees.FBI agents, federal corrections officers, FDA inspectors, NASA employees, TSA staff, Border Patrol staff and CBP officers, census staff, National Park Service staff, members of the Coast Guard, and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers either worked without pay or were furloughed, with increasing numbers of unpaid essential employees failing to show up for work.\n\nOn January 11, 800,000 workers for agencies shutdown or furloughed missed their first paycheck.Federal workers normally receive pay on federal holidays, which include Christmas, New Year\'s Day and potentially Martin Luther King Jr. Day.The shutdown affected the employees\' entitlement to paid holidays due to the shutdown.Unemployment assistance to federal workers furloughed under the government shutdown varied by locality.Only non-reporting workers were eligible for assistance, whereas furloughed workers who still reported to work were not.Workers who received unemployment assistance were required pay it back after the shut down ended and they received backpay.Some furloughed workers sought other employment opportunities while they were idled.However, external employment must meet agency-specific ethics guidelines, and mandatory reviews of external employment were also curtailed as most ethics officials were also furloughed.Federal employees were not able to use vacation or sick leave during the shutdown so scheduled holiday vacation time either became unpaid if the worker was deemed non-essential or was cancelled if the worker was deemed essential.In many cases unused leave over a certain threshold expired at year-end, but employees who had leave scheduled in advance of the shutdown did not have ""use or lose"" leave balances deducted from their accrued leave.Many furloughed employees took to crowd-funding campaigns to raise cash to replace missed paychecks, but these types of solicitations also run afoul of government ethics rules.\n\nAs furloughed federal workers and their families shared stories of their hardships, such as not being able to meet rent or mortgage payments and missed bills, the hashtag ""#ShutdownStories"" went viral on social media.The federal government\'s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) responded by publishing sample letters that employees could send to their creditors.One read, in part, ""I am a Federal employee who has recently been furloughed due to a lack of funding of my agency.Because of this, my income has been severely cut and I am unable to pay the entire cost of my mortgage, along with my other expenses.""Other federal workers reached out to other news outlets to share stories about having to stretch their budgets and the impact of the shutdown on their families.In addition to being unable to meet rent or pay bills, many federal workers around the country were unable to pay for groceries and turned to food banks.One federal prison guard in Louisiana attempted suicide after posting about the financial pressures of the shutdown on Facebook.\n\nThe OPM also suggested that employees who had landlords write: ""I would like to discuss with you the possibility of trading my services to perform maintenance (e.g. painting, carpentry work) in exchange for partial rent payments"" and suggested those who lacked funds to pay bills should hire personal attorneys to assist them.Other organizations also posted advice on how to ""find supplemental income""; the Coast Guard suggested that Coast Guard members ""have a garage sale, offer to watch children, walk pets or house sit"" while furloughed.\n\nOn January 4, The Washington Post reported that because the shutdown was triggered by the failure to enact spending bills that continued a federal government pay freeze, hundreds of senior Trump administration political appointees would receive a roughly $10,000 pay raise the following day.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the pending pay raise was an ""unnecessary byproduct of the shutdown.""\n\nOn January 10, the Senate approved by unanimous consent a bill (S.24, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019) providing that furloughed federal employees would receive back pay for the period of the furlough once appropriations were restored; the bill was approved the next day by the House on a vote of 411–7.Trump signed the bill into law on January 16.\n\nNative American tribes were not paid for treaties negotiated with the United States government.These treaties specified that the federal government must provide funding for health clinics, employee salaries, education, infrastructure and other services, which were not paid during the shutdown.Native lands are ""owned, managed and maintained by the federal government.""Native Americans who receive a per capita check for profits from oil and gas sales from tribal land did not receive check for the month of February.Roads were not plowed on tribal land, and some areas received significant snowfall.This caused people of the Navajo Nation to become trapped inside their homes.Food services, which fed 90,000 Native Americans in 2017, were halted.\n\nNative American communities had a high percentage of individuals who worked for the federal government and lost income during the shutdown.In North and South Dakota, one of the largest employers is the Indian Health Service.The Chippewa tribe reported an economic loss of nearly $100,000 daily in funds that the federal government was supposed to provide as a treaty obligation.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was closed for the shutdown.However, 60 percent of the Indian Health Service (IHS) continued to work without pay.IHS provides care for 2.2 million Native Americans and on January 23, began to deny care that was not considered ""life threatening.""The Bureau of Indian Education was able to stay open because it was funded on a different schedule.Unlike other government shutdowns, there was little outreach from the Trump Administration to Native Americans and the Chippewa tribe in Michigan was given a 24-hour notice that the shutdown would take place and affect the tribe.\n\nThe only military branch that was affected by the shutdown was the Coast Guard because it was part of the Department of Homeland Security, while the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps were all funded through the Department of Defense.Officials were able to fund payment on December 31, 2018, but were not able to do so for the paychecks of January 15 and 30, 2019, along with the pay and benefits for civilian workers and retirees.During the shutdown, the Coast Guard continued to engage in patrolling the American coastline and carrying out overseas missions in locations such as the Persian Gulf along with the Navy and in the Caribbean.Other issues arose in the payment processes for Coast Guard members Tricare Health and Dental Program payments, although the individuals were still covered.\n\nMilitary schools, such as the Coast Guard Academy and the National War College, lost funding due to the shutdown and the schools had to work to find funds to pay professors.\n\nAlthough the Department of Defense was not shut down, the February 4, 2019, date for release of the Pentagon\'s 2020 budget was delayed by at least one month.This had repercussions on the interim period which is usually used by Pentagon planners for adjustments before the 2020 fiscal year which will begin in October 2019.The White House Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the Pentagon request, was shut down when the Pentagon budget arrived in December, and remained inactive, so no work was done on the budget.\n\nOn February 25, 2019, the Pentagon\'s counter-drug (interdiction) funding has up to $85 million not yet obligated, but that money was planned for the known corridors in El Paso, Tucson, Yuma, and El Centro for border fencing, lighting, and road projects, so any funds which might possibly be intended for additional projects elsewhere along the border must be obligated by September 30, 2019, in order not to affect the known corridors.Otherwise appropriations above the $85 million not yet obligated for additional interdiction border projects will have to be approved by additional Congressional appropriations, to reach the $2 billion target.\n\nA January 28, 2019 Congressional Budget Office report estimated that the 35-day partial government shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion, including $3 billion in permanent losses; the CBO estimate excluded indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.The furloughing of 145,000 federal workers and 112,500 federal contractors in the Washington Metropolitan Area cost the regional economy $119 million each day, or 7.3% of the region\'s total output.That reduced GDP by over $2.8 billion in the Washington DC area alone.The shutdown also had a noticeable impact on hunger in the national capital region: food pantries in Washington DC and Northern Virginia reported an increase of around 10% in the number of people coming to pick up groceries, with most of that increase coming from federal workers and contractors.\n\nFitch Ratings warned that an extended shutdown might lead to a downgrade in the U.S.\'s Triple-A credit rating if lawmakers were unable to pass a budget or manage the debt ceiling.That in turn would make borrowing more costly for companies and American households, because it is the benchmark for many other lines of credit.The only time the U.S. credit rating has been downgraded by S&P was during the United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011.\n\nSome economists believed that an extended shutdown would weaken consumer confidence and heighten the risk of pushing the U.S. economy into a recession.Between 800,000 federal government employees and some 4 million federal contractors, the shutdown directly affected nearly 3% of the labor force of the United States; in a typical recession, unemployment increases 2–4%.The reduction in spending by those households combined with the reduction of government services could have macroeconomic results similar to a typical recession.The shutdown had an adverse effect on the budgets of state and local governments, as states covered some federal services (particularly the most vulnerable) during the shutdown.\n\nBy mid-January 2019, the White House Council of Economic Advisors estimated that each week of the shutdown reduced GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, the equivalent of 1.2 points per quarter.CEA chairman Kevin Hassett later acknowledged that GDP growth could decline to zero in the first quarter of 2019 if the shutdown lasted the entire quarter.\n\nAs tax season began in the United States on January 28, some 46,000 Internal Revenue Service workers were called back to work to ensure tax refunds and returns were not affected by the shutdown.The recalled workers allowed the department to continue operations that were automatic and those deemed necessary for the safety of human life or protection of government property, such as processing electronic returns, returns with payments, mailing tax forms, appeals, criminal law enforcement investigations and technical support.\n\nDuring the shutdown, 95% of federal staff for the USDA\'s Food and Nutrition Services were furloughed.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the food-stamp program, could be funded through a $3 billion contingency fund appropriated by Congress in 2018; if the shutdown had continued through March 2019, those funds would have been exhausted, leaving some 38 million Americans without food stamps and endangering food security.Concerns were raised that continuation of the shutdown could delay the issuance of some $140 billion in tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees most of the food supply in the U.S.In early January, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner, reported that the FDA suspended food inspections.He noted that inspection of foreign food was continuing as ""almost normal,"" because they are considered vital.Around January 14, ""high-risk"" food inspections resumed.As of January 22, 2019, 46 percent of the FDA were working, though 20 percent of them were working without pay.During the shutdown, two new recalls for contamination with Listeria or Salmonella took place.Consumer advocacy groups advised of food safety issues during the shutdown.Food safety attorney, Bill Marler, advocated against eating ""fresh, uncooked products on the market place.""Because there was a shortage of FDA inspectors, many imported perishable items, such as produce or flowers, were at risk of spoilage.Meat and some egg products are inspected by the USDA\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service.Federal legislation required those inspectors to remain working without pay.\n\nSchool administrations raised concern about how to feed children who purchase food at the schools for lunch, as funding concerns caused some districts to conserve food and funding.Many limited the amount or variation of foods available for the children to purchase, and alerted parents to the concerns and the limited availability of some of the items.Most schools affected were in high-poverty areas, and depended on federally funded lunch programs, such as the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) a federal grant established by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 and operated through the Department of Agriculture.Some 22 million students in nearly 100,000 schools received school meals through that operation.\n\nAs with the January 2018 shutdown, national parks were expected to be open to the extent practical, though there would be no staff and buildings would be closed.The shutdown affected national parks unevenly, some were accessible with bare-bones staffing levels, some operated with money from states or charitable groups, and others were locked off.Diane Regas, president and chief executive of the Trust for Public Land, called upon Trump to close all national parks to protect the public: by the third week of the shutdown, three people had died in national parks.This number was reported as being within \'usual\' levels.At Yosemite National Park, on January 4, 2019, a death from a fall went unreported for a week.\n\nBy January 1, 2019, the problems of neglected trash pileup, overflowing public toilets, and access to first aid were repeated across the Park system.Health and safety concerns were raised, with concerns by scientists that the expansive amount of garbage and human waste could impact water and soil quality, or cause damage to animals in the parks.Other issues that arose due to the shutdown included illegal campsites, protected agriculture being damaged, damaging of government property and trespassing on foot and by vehicle.\n\nNew York kept the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open, as it did during the January 2018 shutdown.Arizona and Utah were able to keep Grand Canyon National Park, Zion National Park, Arches National Park, and Bryce Canyon National Park open and provided services including public restrooms, shuttles and trash collection.Utah\'s funding included visitor centers.The sites closed outright in the southwest alone included Bandelier National Monument and Valles Caldera National Preserve in northern New Mexico, White Sands National Monument in southern New Mexico, Petrified Forest National Park in northern Arizona and Casa Grande Ruins National Monument in south-central Arizona.Access to major parts of Sequoia and Kings Canyon parks were closed, and at Joshua Tree National Park, the administration policy of leaving parks open to visitors despite the staff furloughs resulted in park damage, including the toppling of protected trees.In Texas, Big Bend National Park had no visitor services, such as restrooms.Some trailheads were closed.Regulations continued to be enforced, as the park remained open.Visitors were reminded to remove their own trash and toilet paper.The Alamo remained open but no NPS services were available at the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park.Channel Islands National Park remained open to public access, although services normally provided by the national park service were instead provided by Island Packers Cruises, the company normally in charge of ferries to the islands.\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration closed immediately on December 22, 2018.The Library of Congress, the U.S. Botanic Garden, the Capitol Visitor Center, and the U.S. Capitol Building remained open as they were funded by the 2019 Legislative Branch appropriations bill.The Smithsonian Institution operated on ""prior-year funds"" through January 1, 2019.On January 2, 2019, the Smithsonian Institution initiated an orderly shutdown of all its facilities, including 19 museums in Washington, D.C., and New York City, the National Zoo, and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.The following day, the National Gallery of Art was closed.The National Zoo also closed on January 3, 2019.Tourism attendance on the National Mall was affected.On January 5, 2019, acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt directed the diversion of fee revenue defined by the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to be used to fund minimal maintenance activities so as to preserve access to highly visited parks.\n\nAccording to a January 12, 2019, article in The Economist, on January 11, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was unable to pay its workers who had not been paid since December 22; 55% more of them called in sick than in January 2018.\n\nAs the air traffic controllers were deemed essential employees, they were required to work without pay.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents air traffic controllers, filed a lawsuit against the federal government for the shutdown on January 11, 2019, claiming that requiring 16,000 air traffic controllers to work without being paid violated their constitutional rights and federal minimum wage law.That was the third lawsuit filed against the federal government since the beginning of the shutdown.\n\nAirline and aircraft safety inspectors, on the other hand, were deemed nonessential and furloughed.A news report on January 12, 2019, stated that the Federal Aviation Administration had returned 500 furloughed safety inspectors back to work and would return more to work in the following weeks.As the airline and aircraft safety inspectors were furloughed, the certification process of the Airbus A220 in the US was stalled.Delta Air Lines was forced to delay the launch of the new aircraft, and to use other models of aircraft to serve those routes that was supposed to be served with A220.Many TSA employees also called out sick, most of them because they were trying to find other jobs that would provide immediate paychecks.\n\nThe shutdown initially prevented the National Transportation Safety Board from assisting the Mexican government\'s investigation of the 2018 Puebla helicopter crash that killed a state governor and senator; an exception allowed the NTSB to assist with the Mexican government in the investigation along with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.The NTSB also had to delay several investigations until the government reopened and only continued investigations into accidents that were considered the most serious.Issues in receiving certification and oversight from the FAA led to a month-long delay in the commencement of passenger service at Paine Field in Everett, Washington.\n\nAs the shutdown continued into its fourth week, the unions representing airline pilots, flight attendants and air traffic controllers issued a statement asserting, ""we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play"" because of the shutdown.\n\nSome airports such as the Philadelphia International Airport, launched food and item donations for federal employees who were affected by the shutdown.Other airports such as the Miami International Airport, and the George Bush International Airport, closed down terminals in order to spread out the TSA workers that were available.\n\nOn January 25, flights destined for LaGuardia Airport in New York were halted to a groundstop by FAA officials due to staffing shortages directly as a result of the shutdown.As a result, several flights to and from neighboring airports in the Northeast, specifically Philadelphia and Newark, suffered significant delays of their own.Soon after that, appropriations passed and the government reopened.\n\nThe shutdown delayed software updates to the Boeing 737 MAX airplane which may have caused the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.\n\nDuring the shutdown, court-appointed private lawyers who represent indigent defendants worked without pay.The Federal Judiciary initially had a goal of sustaining paid operations through January 18, 2019.It said it would run out of money to sustain court operations no earlier than January 25, but perhaps as late as February 1.Failing funding, the Judiciary would operate under the terms of the Antideficiency Act.This Act does not allow federal agencies to expend federal funds before an appropriation, nor to accept any voluntary services.The judiciary had 33,000 employees nationwide.Under the Constitution, Supreme Court Justices, appeals court judges and district judges would continue to be paid.\n\nThe shutdown caused many delays and disruptions in cases.Budgets were watched carefully to be able to pay public defenders, DNA testing, informants, and travel costs to interview victims and witnesses.Staffing issues also brought about concerns and constraints with prisons lacking the staff to safely hold attorney-client visits, and caused a delay in bail hearings.\n\nAgents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed in a report released on January 22, 2019, by the FBI Agents Association, that several different investigations were compromised by the shutdown.The report was called ""Voices from the Field"" and was 72 pages long.FBI agents were unable to pay Confidential Human Sources which risks losing that informant permanently.Some FBI divisions no longer have Spanish-speaking staff on hand and could not work with informants who only speak Spanish.Some agents reported that they did not have the funds to assist in joint operations with local law enforcement.\n\nFederal law enforcement agencies working on Native American land worked without pay through the shutdown.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was forced to cancel a trip to the United States/Mexico border in early January due to the shutdown.DHS was also unable to inspect Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities during the shutdown to ensure that immigrants were being held in facilities appropriately.During the shutdown, the federal government\'s e-Verify system—a system for employers to check the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States—was halted.\n\nDuring the shutdown, a wave of Domain Name System (DNS) attacks on government sites was detected by Homeland Security.The attacks were serious because these Internet sites could be hijacked.\n\nOfficial websites for agencies were rendered insecure or inaccessible through the shutdown, as the expired digital certificates were not renewed.On January 23, DHS asked all government agencies to secure their DNS records; however, many agencies were not able to respond quickly to this request.\n\nExecutive and legislative affairs of the local government of the District of Columbia continued operating through the shutdown, due to a provision previously enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017.The District\'s local court system, including the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, are part of the federal judiciary.Thus, they were partially shut down, preventing District residents from accessing services such as marriage licensing.The District of Columbia government said it would take over trash collection and snow plowing operations for National Park Service facilities in Washington.\n\nThe shutdown also interfered with the response to the 2018 Sunda Strait tsunami, as the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta\'s Twitter account was unable to tweet updates, and the United States Geological Survey was unable to provide data on the tsunami.The American weather model, the GFS, suffered a significant drop in forecast quality when a data format change during the shutdown prevented certain weather data from being recognized by the GFS, and the shutdown prevented the bug from being corrected.\n\nBy mid-day Thursday, January 3, 2019, the FCC had suspended operations.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai canceled his trip to the Consumer Electronics Show.The FTC also suspended certain online operations.The EPA and Department of Energy\'s Energy Star website was not available for the duration of the shutdown.\n\nMakers of alcoholic beverages were unable to receive approval from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau for new labels and recipes during the shutdown.\n\nBased on the recalculation of their operating reserves, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) would have had to cease patent operations in the second week of February.A cadre of personnel was allocated to continue receiving patent applications, receive payments, and maintain the IT infrastructure.Even though the USPTO is self-funded, a Congressional appropriation is required to permit the USPTO to spend money.The pipeline of patent applications at the time took 15.8 months for a response from an examiner.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution shortened to two days and downscaled its scheduled ten-day 2019 Folklife Festival on the National Mall because of the shutdown\'s effects.Sabrina Motley, the director of the festival, said that initially, crucial funding for the June—July event arrived later than expected, slowing preparations.Motley stated: ""The government opened back up, but it took a while for systems to come back online. ...We looked at our production schedule, and it became clear we would need more time than we had.""\n\nThe White House residence staff who stage public receptions were among those furloughed, with a minimal staff continuing to work unpaid for the first family.In the midst of the shutdown Trump invited the Clemson Tigers football team to a White House dinner reception on January 14 in recognition of their College Football Playoff National Championship win.On the morning of the reception Trump announced that he intended to serve fast food hamburgers and pizza to the team, a remark that some commentators interpreted as a joke.That evening Trump welcomed the team in the State Dining Room with a buffet of fast food and pizza from McDonald\'s, Wendy\'s and other restaurant chains, which he stated that he had paid for personally.Trump served fast food to other visiting athletes later that year, after the shutdown had ended.\n\nOn January 10, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with several other unions, announced plans to protest the government shutdown at 1:00pm EST in Washington, DC.Leaders of the National Federation of Federal Employees stated they had hoped that bringing federal workers to the President\'s doorstep would show him that it was the individual workers that the shutdown was hurting the most.President Trump had left to visit the US–Mexican border in Texas earlier in the day.\n\nSimilar protests took place in Philadelphia and St. Louis, among other cities.On January 15, representatives for Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, and Vietnam Veterans of America along with others called for an end to shutdown, but avoided placing any blame on political parties.\n\nShortly after the protests, the American Federation of Government Employees sued the Trump administration to challenge the arrangements for work without pay during the shutdown.A similar suit was raised and won during the 2013 Federal Government shutdown.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association also sued the Trump administration, as the shutdown allegedly violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by failing to pay the workers at least a minimum wage during the shutdown.\n\nAs the salaries for members of Congress are written into permanent law and not funded through annual appropriations, the government shutdown did not affect their salaries.Senators and Representatives were still paid their biweekly salaries of $6,700 towards at least $174,000 a year.\n\nSeveral Democratic and Republican Senators and Representatives said they would donate or refuse their salary during the shutdown.Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw stated that he would refuse his salary, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto indicated she would donate hers to a Nevada charity, Senator Mazie Hirono said she would donate her salary to Hawaii food banks, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would give hers to refugee non-profit HIAS, New York Congressman Max Rose stated that he would give his salary to charity and outgoing Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota pledged hers to charity, along with her Republican colleague John Hoeven.Republican senator Kevin Cramer, who defeated Heidi Heitkamp in the 2018 midterm elections, refused to donate his salary, calling the move ""gimmicky"".Representative Brian Fitzpatrick urged all members of Congress to decline their paychecks.He said, ""If you\'re in Congress, don\'t just delay your pay -- forfeit it, write a check back to the US Treasury.Then you\'ll feel the pain of federal workers.""\n\nBy January 17, 2019, 102 members of Congress—20 Senators and 82 Representatives— chose to decline their paychecks or were donating their paychecks to charity.\n\nDuring the shutdown, many federal workers used food banks and food pantries in order to feed themselves and their families.Many food pantries waived certain restrictions in order to help government workers have access to food.During the shutdown, the Salvation Army Emergency Disasters Services program provided meals for federal workers.Chef Jose Andres created the #ChefsForFeds program to feed federal workers in Washington, D.C. and by January 21, made announcements to expand the program nationwide.\n\nSome states such as California, offered furloughed employees unemployment benefits, although the Trump administration allegedly told states that they could not do so with federal funds.Organizations such as state Attorney Generals offices, and credit card companies posted statements to their websites to offer a means to help to consolidate debt, meet mortgages or other payments such as child support or tuition.An employment law firm offered pro bono legal advice to furloughed federal employees.School districts opened up free or reduced lunch options for children of federal employees, and looked into other options to aid parents amid concerns that financial stress at home would adversely affect families and children.Every mainline denomination in America has contributed to efforts to provide relief.One Baptist church emptied its entire disaster fund to aid federal employees.\n\nOn January 24, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross downplayed the financial difficulties faced by the 800,000 federal workers affected by the shutdown, stating that they should borrow money to ""tide them over"" until the shutdown ends.Critics and Democrats criticized the statement as inappropriate, noting that Ross\' own net worth is estimated at almost $700 million, accusing him of being out of touch with the workers.Ross also said that he ""did not understand"" why people who were not getting paid due to the shutdown were visiting food banks.When asked about Ross\' statement, Trump suggested that grocery stores will ""work along"" with the government by voluntarily extending credit to those who are out of funds to buy food.National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow characterized the shutdown as a ""glitch"" and suggested that federal workers who were required to work without pay were ""volunteering"" to work for their love of the country and ""presumably their allegiance to President Trump.""\n\nIn a video message to staff, FBI director Christopher Wray stated, ""Making some people stay home when they don\'t want to, and making others show up without pay, it\'s mind-boggling, it\'s shortsighted and it\'s unfair.It takes a lot to get me angry, but I\'m about as angry as I\'ve been in a long, long time.""\n\nLara Trump, a daughter-in-law of the President, drew outrage after an interview in which she stated that while ""It\'s not fair to you..."" the shutdown was ""...a little bit of pain, but it\'s going to be for the future of our country, and their children and their grandchildren and generations after them will thank them for their sacrifice right now.""Her comments drew criticism by politicians, celebrities, and the general public who felt the advisor and spokeswoman for the Trump 2020 campaign was out of touch, however Lara Trump later claimed the comments were taken out of context.\n\nIn January 2019, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that 56% of the responding public opposed a wall while 39% favored it, and 45% viewed the situation at the border as a crisis.The numbers were similar to the poll in December 2018 yet a later poll by ABC News showed that as the partial shutdown entered its fourth week support for building a wall was increasing.A poll done through YouGov between December 23–25, 2018, reported that 51% of respondents thought Trump deserved ""a lot"" of the blame, 44% thought congressional Democrats and 39% thought congressional Republicans.Similar results were reported by a December 21–25 survey done by Reuters and Ipsos in which 47% of respondents said that the shutdown was the President\'s fault and 33% blamed Congressional Democrats.\n\nOver the course of the shutdown, Trump\'s approval rating marginally declined while his disapproval rating marginally increased.His net approval rating was by the middle of January 2019 at its lowest point since February 2018.On December 27, 2018, it was reported that Trump\'s approval rating of registered voters was at 39%, with 56% disapproval.Broken down the rating was split across party lines, with Republicans reporting an 80% approval rate while Democrats and independents reported a 90% and 57% disapproval rating, respectively.The poll was conducted through Morning Consult between December 21–23.The poll also reported that 43% of respondents blamed Trump for the shutdown, with 31% blaming congressional Democrats and 7% congressional Republicans.Another poll through The New York Times Upshot/Siena College reported that 89% of voters\' views on Trump and the wall were aligned, suggesting that support for the wall was a function of support for Trump.\n\nThe Washington Post–ABC News poll published on January 13, 2019, found that a larger number of Americans blamed Trump and congressional Republicans than congressional Democrats for the shutdown.A PBS NewsHour–Marist poll found that on January 15, 2019, a majority of Americans thought that President Trump was to blame for the shutdown.A January 2019 poll conducted by telephone for CBS News found that 70% of Americans polled did not want a government shutdown over the issue of building a border wall; 66% believed that Trump should agree to a budget without wall funding.\n\nPresidency of Donald Trump Donald Trump January 2018 United

58,"{'Wiki_Title': '2018–2019 United States federal government shutdown', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The United States federal government shutdown from midnight EST on December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019 (35 days) was the longest government shutdown in history and the second and final federal government shutdown involving furloughs during the presidency of Donald Trump.It occurred when the 115th Congress and Trump could not agree on an appropriations bill to fund the operations of the federal government for the 2019 fiscal year, or a temporary continuing resolution that would extend the deadline for passing a bill.The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal departments or agencies from conducting non-essential operations without appropriations legislation in place.As a result, nine executive departments with around 800,000 employees had to shut down partially or in full, affecting about one-fourth of government activities and causing employees to be furloughed or required to work without being paid.The Congressional Budget Office estimated the shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion USD, excluding indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.\n\nThe shutdown stemmed from an impasse over Trump\'s demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall.In December 2018, the Senate unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding, and the bill appeared likely to be approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Trump.After Trump faced heavy criticism from some right-wing media outlets and pundits for appearing to back down on his campaign promise to ""build the wall"", he announced that he would not sign any appropriations bill that did not fund its construction.As a result, the House passed a stopgap bill with funding for the wall, but it was blocked in the Senate by the threat of a Democratic filibuster.\n\nIn January 2019, representatives elected in the November 2018 election took office, giving the Democrats a majority in the House.The House immediately voted to approve the appropriations bill that had previously passed the Senate unanimously (which included no funding for the wall).For several weeks, Trump continued to maintain that he would veto any bill that did not fund an entire border wall, and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the Senate from considering any appropriations legislation that Trump would not support, including the bill that had previously passed.Democrats and some Republicans opposed the shutdown and passed multiple bills to reopen the government, arguing that the government shutdown amounted to ""hostage-taking"" civil servants and that negotiations could only begin once the government was reopened.\n\nOn January 25, 2019, Trump agreed to endorse a stopgap bill to reopen the government for three weeks up until February 15 to allow for negotiations to take place to approve an appropriations bill that both parties could agree on.However, Trump reiterated his demand for the border wall funding and said that he would shut down the government again or declare a national emergency and use military funding to build the wall if Congress did not appropriate the funds by February 15.\n\nTrump\'s approval rating dropped during the shutdown.A majority of Americans opposed exploitation of the shutdown as a negotiating strategy and held Trump responsible for the shutdown: A CBS News poll found that 71% of Americans considered the border wall ""not worth the shutdown"" and a Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 53% of Americans blamed Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, compared to 34% who blamed Democrats and 10% who blamed both parties.\n\nOn February 15, 2019, Trump declared a national emergency to fund the wall and bypass Congress, after being unsatisfied with a bipartisan border bill that had passed the House and the Senate a day before.\n\nDuring his 2016 campaign, then-candidate Trump promised to build a wall along the Mexico–United States border for which Mexico would pay.The president of Mexico rejected the idea of providing any funding for a U.S. border wall.In 2018, Trump requested $ in federal funding for some of barrier on the border, mostly to replace of aging fence built under the Secure Fence Act of 2006.On December 25, 2018, Trump reversed course, suggesting that he might accept of either mostly refurbished barrier (rather than new barriers in locations that did not previously have them) by November 2020.Trump\'s proposals and public statements on the wall have shifted widely over time, with varied proposals as to the design, material, length, height, and width of a wall.\n\nIn September 2018, Congress passed two ""minibus"" appropriations bills for the 2019 United States federal budget, which began on October 1, 2018.These bills combined five of the 12 regular appropriations bills covering 77% of federal discretionary funding, and included a continuing resolution until December 7 for the remaining agencies.On December 6, Congress passed a second continuing resolution to December 21, to give more time for negotiations on Trump\'s proposed border wall, which had been delayed due to the funeral of George H. W. Bush.\n\nA Senate Homeland Security appropriations bill, negotiated by both parties and reported by the committee to the Senate, provided for $ for border security, including funds for ""approximately 65 miles of pedestrian fencing along the southwest border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector"".The bill did not receive a vote on the Senate floor, although House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer indicated that such a proposal could be acceptable to House Democrats.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said the Democratic Party would not support $ for the border wall.At a press conference before the government shutdown, he noted ""the $1.6 billion for border security negotiated by Democrats and Republicans is our position.We believe that is the right way to go.""\n\nOn December 11, President Trump held a televised meeting with Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in the Oval Office and asked them to support an appropriation of $5.7 billion for funding of a border wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico.They refused, resulting in an argument between Trump and both Congressional leaders.During the contentious discussion, Trump remarked, ""I am proud to shut down the government for border security ...I will be the one to shut [the government] down.I\'m not going to blame you for it ...I will take the mantle.I will be the one to shut it down.""Schumer replied, ""We shouldn\'t shut down the government over a dispute.""Ten days later, Trump blamed Democrats for the impending shutdown.\n\nThree days later, Politico reported that Trump was willing to sign a bill with no funding for a border wall that delayed a government shutdown into 2019 and the new Congress.On December 18, following a meeting with Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the government would not shut down on December 22 and that Trump was ""flexible"" over funding for a border wall.Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby commented that the most likely resolution was a bill that funded the government until early February.Schumer added that his caucus would ""very seriously"" consider such a bill and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said ""I don\'t know anybody on the Hill that wants a shutdown, and I think all the president\'s advisers are telling him this would not be good.""\n\nOn December 19, the Senate passed a second continuing resolution () that would fund the government until February 8, 2019.Pelosi announced that House Democrats would support the measure, meaning it would overcome opposition from conservative Republicans and pass the House.On December 20, following increased criticism from conservative media, pundits, and political figures, Trump reversed his position and declared that he would not sign any funding bill that did not include border wall funding.The same day, the House passed a continuing resolution that included $5 billion for the wall and $8 billion in disaster aid.This bill failed in the Senate.Trump\'s changing position caused consternation among Senate Republicans.\n\nThe shutdown started December 22 and Trump announced that he would cancel his planned trip to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas and stay in Washington, D.C.The meaning of the term ""wall"" was expected to be an aspect of the negotiations.\n\nCongress adjourned on December 22 for the Christmas and holiday season, with many predicting that the shutdown would not be resolved until the start of the 116th Congress.The Senate reconvened on December 27 for four minutes, with Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) presiding over the session.The House briefly reconvened as well, with Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) saying that members should not expect any further votes for the rest of 2018.Representative Jim McGovern (D-MA) went to the House floor to try to force consideration of a short-term funding bill to end the shutdown that the Senate had already passed, but the Republican Speaker-pro-tem refused to let him speak.\n\nCongress then adjourned again until December 31, 2018, for a pro forma session.On January 2, 2019, the last full day of the 115th United States Congress, there was a pro forma session scheduled to last several minutes.\n\nThe new Congress was sworn in on January 3, 2019, and one of the first orders of business in the House after electing the Speaker and swearing in the new members was a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security until February 8 (), which passed by a vote of 239–192; and a package combining five appropriation bills funding the rest of the government for the remainder of the fiscal year (), passed by a vote of 241–190.The bills contained $1.3 billion of funding for border security, but no additional funding for a border wall.\n\nBeginning on January 9, the Democratic-controlled House voted on four appropriations bills individually:\n\nFinancial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Treasury (including the Internal Revenue Service), federal judiciary, District of Columbia, and a number of independent agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission, Federal Trade Commission, General Services Administration, and Securities and Exchange Commission.The House passed the legislation on January 9, on a 240–188 vote, with every Democrat and eight Republicans voting yes, and all other Republicans voting no. Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Department of Agriculture (including food stamps), the Food and Drug Administration, and related entities.On January 10, the House passed this bill 243–183.Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore Transportation and Housing and Urban Development (including some federal mortgage programs).On January 10, the House passed this bill 244–180.Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 () – bill to restore appropriations to the Interior Department, Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies, including the Smithsonian Institution.On January 11, ten House Republicans voted with Democrats in a 240–179 vote to end the shutdown of Interior-Environment programs.It was the most recent of a ""series of standalone appropriations measures"" the House sent to the Senate.\n\nThis strategy has been compared to one used by Republicans during the 2013 shutdown in the form of a series of fourteen mini-continuing resolutions.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed that the Senate would not consider the House bills to reopen the government, indicating that Senate Republicans would not support any bill unless it had Trump\'s support.In January 2019, McConnell and Senate Republicans came under increased pressure to break the impasse and reopen the government.Three Republican Senators—Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Cory Gardner of Colorado—called for an end to the shutdown.Senators Collins and Gardner said they supported the House\'s budget bills to end the shutdown.West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito said that she could support ending the shutdown provided border wall talks continued.Pat Roberts of Kansas said that shutdowns ""never work"" and only turned affected federal workers into ""pawns"" and that, although the time had not yet come for Senate Republicans to override any possible Trump veto and end the shutdown, ""we\'re getting pretty close.""Johnny Isakson of Georgia echoed that sentiment, saying that support for McConnell\'s refusal to support bills that do not include funding for a wall would not last indefinitely: ""There\'s a time when that may run out.""\n\nOn January 16, McConnell again blocked the House appropriation bills to reopen the government from being considered on the Senate floor.The following day, McConnell blocked consideration of bills to reopen most of the closed government agencies for a third time.On January 23, McConnell blocked a bill to reopen most of the government for the fourth time.\n\nOn January 22, McConnell stated that the Senate would be voting on two different bills to end the shutdown on January 24.The first vote is on a bill to reopen the government which includes Trump\'s proposal to provide $5.7 billion for a border wall and temporary protections to some immigration classes.The other bill is a three-week continuing resolution to fund 25% of the government through February 8.\n\nOn January 22, Senator Mark Warner introduced a bill to keep the federal government running in the event of future shutdown events.The bill is called the ""Stop Shutdowns Transferring Unnecessary Pain and Inflicting Damage in the Coming Years Act"" or the ""Stop STUPIDITY Act"".\n\nOn January 24, the Senate held two votes on competing Democratic and Republican proposals to end the shutdown.The Democratic proposal was largely similar to the measure that had previously passed the Senate unanimously in the 115th Congress, and then been passed by the Democratic-controlled House in the 116th Congress.It provided funding for the government with no money for the border wall.The Republican proposal incorporated Trump\'s proposal, which would fund a border wall; temporarily extend TPS and DACA for three years, but would substantially narrow eligibility for DACA; and make significant legal changes to make it more difficult for persons escaping violence and persecution to be granted asylum in the United States.Neither proposal was able to attain the 60 votes needed for passage.The Trump plan failed in a 50–47 vote.The Democratic plan failed in a 52–44 vote.Most Republicans voted for Trump\'s plan and against the Democratic plan.Most Democrats voted for the Democratic plan and against Trump\'s plan.Republicans Tom Cotton and Mike Lee voted against both plans.Democrat Joe Manchin and Republicans Lamar Alexander, Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, Johnny Isakson, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney voted for both plans.Not voting on either were Republicans Rand Paul and Jim Risch and Democrat Jacky Rosen.Republican Richard Burr voted for Trump\'s plan and did not vote on the Democratic plan.\n\nOn January 25, House Democrats prepared a compromise proposal to reopen the government, which would provide $5 billion for border security but no wall construction.However, the shutdown ended the same day.\n\nOn January 4, after the new Congress was sworn-in and Pelosi regained the speakership, she and Schumer, as well as congressional Republican leadership met with Trump at the White House.Pelosi and Schumer argued that the shutdown needed to end and reported that Trump refused.They said that Trump threatened to ""keep the government closed for a very long period of time.Months or even years.""Later that day, Trump admitted to ""absolutely"" making that threat, adding, ""I\'m very proud of doing what I\'m doing.""Trump then said that he was considering declaring a national emergency to use military funding for the wall.At the meeting, Trump reprimanded his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney for attempting to propose a compromise between Trump\'s $5.7 billion demand for a border wall and the Democrats\' proposal of $1.3 billion for border security.\n\nTrump addressed the nation from the Oval Office at 9 p.m. EST on January 8, in a nationally televised address broadcast on both network and cable television.In his speech, Trump asserted that there was a ""growing humanitarian and security crisis"" on the Mexico–United States border that could only be solved by appropriating $5.7 billion for construction of a steel wall.Trump did not make any new proposals in his speech to break the impasse.Immediately after Trump\'s speech, Schumer and Pelosi delivered a response on behalf of the Democrats, in which they demanded an end to the shutdown and said: ""President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government.""\n\nTrump met with congressional leadership again on January 9, in a meeting lasting 14 minutes.Trump asked Pelosi, ""Will you agree to my wall?"" and when she replied that she would not, Trump said ""bye-bye"" and walked out of the meeting, later declaring it ""a total waste of time"".Schumer accused Trump of throwing a ""temper tantrum"" and slamming his hands on the table.Trump rebuked Schumer\'s comments on Twitter.Vice President Mike Pence and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that Trump remained calm and never raised his voice.On January 10, Pelosi described the preceding day\'s meeting with Trump as ""a setup"" staged by White House aides so that Trump could walk out of the meeting.Pelosi described Trump as ""un-presidential""; accused him of ""exploiting this situation in a way that enhances his power""; and said: ""I don\'t think he really wants a solution.I think he loves the distraction.""\n\nAfter Trump walked out of the January 9 meeting with congressional Democratic leaders, no further negotiations were conducted.Several Republican senators met in the office of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, after the meeting to discuss a compromise to end the shutdown.They discussed agreeing to Trump\'s demand for border wall funding and offering the Democrats help for Dreamers, refugee protections and extensions to H-2B visas.On January 13, Graham proposed that Trump agree to a congressional vote to reopen the government pending the resumption of negotiations.Graham suggested that if Trump and congressional Democrats did not come to an agreement at that time, Trump could declare a national emergency.Trump rejected this proposal the next day.\n\nOn January 19, Trump proposed a temporary extension of the two programs that protect about 700,000 immigrants from deportation—Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)—in exchange for funding for the border wall.The protections would be temporary, with no path to citizenship.Trump had previously revoked TPS for people from a number of Latin American and African countries, and taken steps to rescind DACA.In his remarks at the White House, Trump referred to a ""barrier"" rather than a ""wall"" and indicated that he aimed to erect ""steel barriers in high priority locations"" rather than ""a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea.""\n\nIn addition to funding a border wall, the 1,300-page Republican bill released after Trump made his proposal would make major changes to U.S. immigration policy (which were not included in Trump\'s public announcement).The legislation would severely restrict the ability of children from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to apply for asylum in the United States.Specifically, participation in the Central American Minors Program would be subject to an annual cap and migrant children would be barred from applying for asylum in person at the border, and only migrant children with a ""qualified"" parent in the U.S. would be eligible to apply.The bill would also create a new, more burdensome application process for TPS holders, and would exclude TPS holders from Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen.The American Immigration Lawyers Association government relations director said that the proposal ""would categorically block tens of thousands of children from ever applying for asylum,"" while a Cato Institute immigration analyst wrote that the proposal would not extend DACA, but rather replace it with ""a totally different program that will exclude untold thousands of Dreamers who would have been eligible under DACA.""\n\nDemocrats rejected Trump\'s proposal.In a speech on the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""The president\'s proposal is one-sided, harshly partisan and was made in bad faith.The asylum changes are a poison pill, if there ever was one.""House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said extending the DACA proposal temporarily was ""unacceptable"" and a ""non-starter"" because it did not ""represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people\'s lives.""Analysts pointed out that Trump had previously rejected a deal that would have provided funding for the border wall in exchange for further protection for DACA recipients.Conversely, Republicans reacted positively to Trump\'s proposal, and Mitch McConnell said he would bring it to a vote in the Senate.\n\nDuring the shutdown, on January 8 in a press conference, a reporter asked Trump if he was considering declaring a national emergency, to which Trump replied, ""I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want"" and suggested that he could declare an emergency.After this, Trump repeatedly threatened to declare a national emergency to unilaterally order wall construction without congressional authorization.Some of Trump\'s advisors, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, reportedly attempted to dissuade him from doing so.Administration officials considered diverting hurricane-relief and wildfire-relief funds from a $13.9 billion February 2018 emergency supplemental appropriations bill (for disaster relief in Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California, among other places) in order to fund a wall, and directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to look into this possibility.\n\nAn attempt by Trump to invoke emergency powers would almost certainly have prompted a lengthy legal challenge in court.Democrats responded that Trump lacked the authority to declare a national emergency; Representative Adam Schiff called it a ""non-starter"" and said that ""if Harry Truman couldn\'t nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this President doesn\'t have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion dollar wall on the border.""Democratic Representative Nydia Velázquez said the notion of redirecting disaster-relief funds to a border wall was ""beyond appalling"".Presidents have declared emergencies in the past, but none has ""involved funding a policy goal after failing to win congressional approval"".Yale Law School professor Bruce Ackerman wrote that the declaration of a national emergency to build a wall as Trump suggested would be unconstitutional and illegal.Other scholars, such as Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice, believed that Trump could make a colorable argument that diverting military-construction appropriations for border-wall construction was legal, but that doing so would be an abuse of power.Law professor Ilya Somin stated that in the unlikely case that Trump succeeded in using the emergency powers in this way, it would set a dangerous precedent, which Republicans would come to regret next time the president was a Democrat.\n\nOn January 11, Trump—while maintaining he has the authority to do so anytime—said he was not in any rush to declare a national emergency to secure wall funding, saying he would rather see Congress ""do its job"" and that the Democrats ""should come back and vote.""The next day he again threatened to use emergency powers if Democrats did not ""come to their senses.""\n\nOn January 16, Pelosi sent a letter to Trump that indicated the House would be unavailable for the 2019 State of the Union Address that was scheduled for January 29.Pelosi wrote, ""Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government reopens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has reopened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on Jan. 29.""The delivery of the State of the Union address had been delayed or substantially changed on only two occasions since 1913.In a letter sent to the Speaker the next day, Trump said she would not be allowed to take military transport aircraft on scheduled visits to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan.Trump replied, ""We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the shutdown is over.""Pelosi and a congressional delegation had planned on visiting overseas American military personnel.\n\nOn January 23, Trump sent a letter to Pelosi insisting that there were no security concerns and that he would hold the State of the Union Address as scheduled.Trump wrote, ""Therefore, I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and Congress of the United States of America regarding the State of our Union.""In a letter sent in reply, Pelosi stated that the House would not consider a concurrent resolution to authorize the State of the Union Address in the House Chamber until the shutdown ended, writing, ""Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened.""\n\nTrump later stated he would look for an alternative, but then retracted that statement in a pair of tweets announcing that he would wait until the end of the shutdown to give the address in the House Chamber.\n\nOn January 25, Trump announced his support for a three-week funding measure that would reopen the government until February 15.The deal, which also moved forward with long-term Department of Homeland Security funding, did not include funds for a wall.As expected, the agreement provided federal employees with back pay.Both the Senate and House of Representatives passed the funding measure by voice vote, sending the resolution to the President\'s desk.Trump signed the bill the same day, ending the shutdown.\n\nLater in January, Republican senators voted unanimously against a bill to provide back pay to federal contractors.\n\nWithout legislation enacted by February 15, a new partial shutdown would have begun, three weeks after the last ended.A bipartisan group of senators and representatives reached an agreement ""in principle"" on February 11, but Trump did not say whether he would sign it.Included was $1.375 billion for 55 miles of steel border fencing.On February 13, it was reported that, against the wishes of Democratic leaders and many Republicans, Trump was blocking the provision of back pay to federal contractors who were still out of pocket from the shutdown.Both houses passed the bill February 14 with enough votes to override a veto if that happened.\n\nOn February 15, at the White House Rose Garden, Trump announced that he had signed the spending bill to keep the government open.He also declared a national emergency, hoping to get access to $8 billion to use for border security.\n\nAgencies funded by two ""minibus"" appropriations bills passed in September 2018 were not affected by the shutdown.About 380,000 federal employees were furloughed, and an additional 420,000 employees for the affected agencies were expected to work with their pay delayed until the end of the shutdown, totaling 800,000 workers affected out of 2.1 million civilian non-postal federal employees.As only about a quarter of the government was shut down, many people who are not federal employees did not fully realize the effects of the shutdown.\n\nAccording to and , these were the affected agencies:\n\nDepartment of State Department of the Treasury Department of Justice Most of the Department of the Interior Department of Agriculture Department of Commerce Department of Housing and Urban Development Department of Transportation Department of Homeland Security Some Department of Health and Human Services agencies Food and Drug Administration Indian Health Service Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Superfund Research Program Executive Office of the President Most independent agencies Judicial Branch\n\nUnaffected agencies include, according to and :\n\nDepartment of Defense Department of Labor Most of the Department of Health and Human Services Department of Energy Department of Education Department of Veterans Affairs Some Department of the Interior agencies Bureau of Reclamation Central Utah Project District of Columbia (excluding courts) Legislative Branch Social Security Administration Nuclear Regulatory Commission Appalachian Regional Commission Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board Delta Regional Authority Denali Commission Northern Border Regional Commission Southeast Crescent Regional Commission Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board American Battle Monuments Commission U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Cemeterial Expenses of the Army, including Arlington National Cemetery and Soldiers\' and Airmen\'s Home National Cemetery Armed Forces Retirement Home Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System Fund Intelligence Community Management Account Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled Corporation for National and Community Service Corporation for Public Broadcasting Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission Institute of Museum and Library Services Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission Medicare Payment Advisory Commission National Council on Disability National Labor Relations Board National Mediation Board Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission Railroad Retirement Board\n\nJobs affected included staff throughout the United States, not just DC area employees.FBI agents, federal corrections officers, FDA inspectors, NASA employees, TSA staff, Border Patrol staff and CBP officers, census staff, National Park Service staff, members of the Coast Guard, and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers either worked without pay or were furloughed, with increasing numbers of unpaid essential employees failing to show up for work.\n\nOn January 11, 800,000 workers for agencies shutdown or furloughed missed their first paycheck.Federal workers normally receive pay on federal holidays, which include Christmas, New Year\'s Day and potentially Martin Luther King Jr. Day.The shutdown affected the employees\' entitlement to paid holidays due to the shutdown.Unemployment assistance to federal workers furloughed under the government shutdown varied by locality.Only non-reporting workers were eligible for assistance, whereas furloughed workers who still reported to work were not.Workers who received unemployment assistance were required pay it back after the shut down ended and they received backpay.Some furloughed workers sought other employment opportunities while they were idled.However, external employment must meet agency-specific ethics guidelines, and mandatory reviews of external employment were also curtailed as most ethics officials were also furloughed.Federal employees were not able to use vacation or sick leave during the shutdown so scheduled holiday vacation time either became unpaid if the worker was deemed non-essential or was cancelled if the worker was deemed essential.In many cases unused leave over a certain threshold expired at year-end, but employees who had leave scheduled in advance of the shutdown did not have ""use or lose"" leave balances deducted from their accrued leave.Many furloughed employees took to crowd-funding campaigns to raise cash to replace missed paychecks, but these types of solicitations also run afoul of government ethics rules.\n\nAs furloughed federal workers and their families shared stories of their hardships, such as not being able to meet rent or mortgage payments and missed bills, the hashtag ""#ShutdownStories"" went viral on social media.The federal government\'s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) responded by publishing sample letters that employees could send to their creditors.One read, in part, ""I am a Federal employee who has recently been furloughed due to a lack of funding of my agency.Because of this, my income has been severely cut and I am unable to pay the entire cost of my mortgage, along with my other expenses.""Other federal workers reached out to other news outlets to share stories about having to stretch their budgets and the impact of the shutdown on their families.In addition to being unable to meet rent or pay bills, many federal workers around the country were unable to pay for groceries and turned to food banks.One federal prison guard in Louisiana attempted suicide after posting about the financial pressures of the shutdown on Facebook.\n\nThe OPM also suggested that employees who had landlords write: ""I would like to discuss with you the possibility of trading my services to perform maintenance (e.g. painting, carpentry work) in exchange for partial rent payments"" and suggested those who lacked funds to pay bills should hire personal attorneys to assist them.Other organizations also posted advice on how to ""find supplemental income""; the Coast Guard suggested that Coast Guard members ""have a garage sale, offer to watch children, walk pets or house sit"" while furloughed.\n\nOn January 4, The Washington Post reported that because the shutdown was triggered by the failure to enact spending bills that continued a federal government pay freeze, hundreds of senior Trump administration political appointees would receive a roughly $10,000 pay raise the following day.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the pending pay raise was an ""unnecessary byproduct of the shutdown.""\n\nOn January 10, the Senate approved by unanimous consent a bill (S.24, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019) providing that furloughed federal employees would receive back pay for the period of the furlough once appropriations were restored; the bill was approved the next day by the House on a vote of 411–7.Trump signed the bill into law on January 16.\n\nNative American tribes were not paid for treaties negotiated with the United States government.These treaties specified that the federal government must provide funding for health clinics, employee salaries, education, infrastructure and other services, which were not paid during the shutdown.Native lands are ""owned, managed and maintained by the federal government.""Native Americans who receive a per capita check for profits from oil and gas sales from tribal land did not receive check for the month of February.Roads were not plowed on tribal land, and some areas received significant snowfall.This caused people of the Navajo Nation to become trapped inside their homes.Food services, which fed 90,000 Native Americans in 2017, were halted.\n\nNative American communities had a high percentage of individuals who worked for the federal government and lost income during the shutdown.In North and South Dakota, one of the largest employers is the Indian Health Service.The Chippewa tribe reported an economic loss of nearly $100,000 daily in funds that the federal government was supposed to provide as a treaty obligation.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was closed for the shutdown.However, 60 percent of the Indian Health Service (IHS) continued to work without pay.IHS provides care for 2.2 million Native Americans and on January 23, began to deny care that was not considered ""life threatening.""The Bureau of Indian Education was able to stay open because it was funded on a different schedule.Unlike other government shutdowns, there was little outreach from the Trump Administration to Native Americans and the Chippewa tribe in Michigan was given a 24-hour notice that the shutdown would take place and affect the tribe.\n\nThe only military branch that was affected by the shutdown was the Coast Guard because it was part of the Department of Homeland Security, while the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps were all funded through the Department of Defense.Officials were able to fund payment on December 31, 2018, but were not able to do so for the paychecks of January 15 and 30, 2019, along with the pay and benefits for civilian workers and retirees.During the shutdown, the Coast Guard continued to engage in patrolling the American coastline and carrying out overseas missions in locations such as the Persian Gulf along with the Navy and in the Caribbean.Other issues arose in the payment processes for Coast Guard members Tricare Health and Dental Program payments, although the individuals were still covered.\n\nMilitary schools, such as the Coast Guard Academy and the National War College, lost funding due to the shutdown and the schools had to work to find funds to pay professors.\n\nAlthough the Department of Defense was not shut down, the February 4, 2019, date for release of the Pentagon\'s 2020 budget was delayed by at least one month.This had repercussions on the interim period which is usually used by Pentagon planners for adjustments before the 2020 fiscal year which will begin in October 2019.The White House Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the Pentagon request, was shut down when the Pentagon budget arrived in December, and remained inactive, so no work was done on the budget.\n\nOn February 25, 2019, the Pentagon\'s counter-drug (interdiction) funding has up to $85 million not yet obligated, but that money was planned for the known corridors in El Paso, Tucson, Yuma, and El Centro for border fencing, lighting, and road projects, so any funds which might possibly be intended for additional projects elsewhere along the border must be obligated by September 30, 2019, in order not to affect the known corridors.Otherwise appropriations above the $85 million not yet obligated for additional interdiction border projects will have to be approved by additional Congressional appropriations, to reach the $2 billion target.\n\nA January 28, 2019 Congressional Budget Office report estimated that the 35-day partial government shutdown cost the American economy at least $11 billion, including $3 billion in permanent losses; the CBO estimate excluded indirect costs that were difficult to quantify.The furloughing of 145,000 federal workers and 112,500 federal contractors in the Washington Metropolitan Area cost the regional economy $119 million each day, or 7.3% of the region\'s total output.That reduced GDP by over $2.8 billion in the Washington DC area alone.The shutdown also had a noticeable impact on hunger in the national capital region: food pantries in Washington DC and Northern Virginia reported an increase of around 10% in the number of people coming to pick up groceries, with most of that increase coming from federal workers and contractors.\n\nFitch Ratings warned that an extended shutdown might lead to a downgrade in the U.S.\'s Triple-A credit rating if lawmakers were unable to pass a budget or manage the debt ceiling.That in turn would make borrowing more costly for companies and American households, because it is the benchmark for many other lines of credit.The only time the U.S. credit rating has been downgraded by S&P was during the United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011.\n\nSome economists believed that an extended shutdown would weaken consumer confidence and heighten the risk of pushing the U.S. economy into a recession.Between 800,000 federal government employees and some 4 million federal contractors, the shutdown directly affected nearly 3% of the labor force of the United States; in a typical recession, unemployment increases 2–4%.The reduction in spending by those households combined with the reduction of government services could have macroeconomic results similar to a typical recession.The shutdown had an adverse effect on the budgets of state and local governments, as states covered some federal services (particularly the most vulnerable) during the shutdown.\n\nBy mid-January 2019, the White House Council of Economic Advisors estimated that each week of the shutdown reduced GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, the equivalent of 1.2 points per quarter.CEA chairman Kevin Hassett later acknowledged that GDP growth could decline to zero in the first quarter of 2019 if the shutdown lasted the entire quarter.\n\nAs tax season began in the United States on January 28, some 46,000 Internal Revenue Service workers were called back to work to ensure tax refunds and returns were not affected by the shutdown.The recalled workers allowed the department to continue operations that were automatic and those deemed necessary for the safety of human life or protection of government property, such as processing electronic returns, returns with payments, mailing tax forms, appeals, criminal law enforcement investigations and technical support.\n\nDuring the shutdown, 95% of federal staff for the USDA\'s Food and Nutrition Services were furloughed.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the food-stamp program, could be funded through a $3 billion contingency fund appropriated by Congress in 2018; if the shutdown had continued through March 2019, those funds would have been exhausted, leaving some 38 million Americans without food stamps and endangering food security.Concerns were raised that continuation of the shutdown could delay the issuance of some $140 billion in tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees most of the food supply in the U.S.In early January, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner, reported that the FDA suspended food inspections.He noted that inspection of foreign food was continuing as ""almost normal,"" because they are considered vital.Around January 14, ""high-risk"" food inspections resumed.As of January 22, 2019, 46 percent of the FDA were working, though 20 percent of them were working without pay.During the shutdown, two new recalls for contamination with Listeria or Salmonella took place.Consumer advocacy groups advised of food safety issues during the shutdown.Food safety attorney, Bill Marler, advocated against eating ""fresh, uncooked products on the market place.""Because there was a shortage of FDA inspectors, many imported perishable items, such as produce or flowers, were at risk of spoilage.Meat and some egg products are inspected by the USDA\'s Food Safety and Inspection Service.Federal legislation required those inspectors to remain working without pay.\n\nSchool administrations raised concern about how to feed children who purchase food at the schools for lunch, as funding concerns caused some districts to conserve food and funding.Many limited the amount or variation of foods available for the children to purchase, and alerted parents to the concerns and the limited availability of some of the items.Most schools affected were in high-poverty areas, and depended on federally funded lunch programs, such as the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) a federal grant established by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 and operated through the Department of Agriculture.Some 22 million students in nearly 100,000 schools received school meals through that operation.\n\nAs with the January 2018 shutdown, national parks were expected to be open to the extent practical, though there would be no staff and buildings would be closed.The shutdown affected national parks unevenly, some were accessible with bare-bones staffing levels, some operated with money from states or charitable groups, and others were locked off.Diane Regas, president and chief executive of the Trust for Public Land, called upon Trump to close all national parks to protect the public: by the third week of the shutdown, three people had died in national parks.This number was reported as being within \'usual\' levels.At Yosemite National Park, on January 4, 2019, a death from a fall went unreported for a week.\n\nBy January 1, 2019, the problems of neglected trash pileup, overflowing public toilets, and access to first aid were repeated across the Park system.Health and safety concerns were raised, with concerns by scientists that the expansive amount of garbage and human waste could impact water and soil quality, or cause damage to animals in the parks.Other issues that arose due to the shutdown included illegal campsites, protected agriculture being damaged, damaging of government property and trespassing on foot and by vehicle.\n\nNew York kept the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open, as it did during the January 2018 shutdown.Arizona and Utah were able to keep Grand Canyon National Park, Zion National Park, Arches National Park, and Bryce Canyon National Park open and provided services including public restrooms, shuttles and trash collection.Utah\'s funding included visitor centers.The sites closed outright in the southwest alone included Bandelier National Monument and Valles Caldera National Preserve in northern New Mexico, White Sands National Monument in southern New Mexico, Petrified Forest National Park in northern Arizona and Casa Grande Ruins National Monument in south-central Arizona.Access to major parts of Sequoia and Kings Canyon parks were closed, and at Joshua Tree National Park, the administration policy of leaving parks open to visitors despite the staff furloughs resulted in park damage, including the toppling of protected trees.In Texas, Big Bend National Park had no visitor services, such as restrooms.Some trailheads were closed.Regulations continued to be enforced, as the park remained open.Visitors were reminded to remove their own trash and toilet paper.The Alamo remained open but no NPS services were available at the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park.Channel Islands National Park remained open to public access, although services normally provided by the national park service were instead provided by Island Packers Cruises, the company normally in charge of ferries to the islands.\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration closed immediately on December 22, 2018.The Library of Congress, the U.S. Botanic Garden, the Capitol Visitor Center, and the U.S. Capitol Building remained open as they were funded by the 2019 Legislative Branch appropriations bill.The Smithsonian Institution operated on ""prior-year funds"" through January 1, 2019.On January 2, 2019, the Smithsonian Institution initiated an orderly shutdown of all its facilities, including 19 museums in Washington, D.C., and New York City, the National Zoo, and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.The following day, the National Gallery of Art was closed.The National Zoo also closed on January 3, 2019.Tourism attendance on the National Mall was affected.On January 5, 2019, acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt directed the diversion of fee revenue defined by the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to be used to fund minimal maintenance activities so as to preserve access to highly visited parks.\n\nAccording to a January 12, 2019, article in The Economist, on January 11, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was unable to pay its workers who had not been paid since December 22; 55% more of them called in sick than in January 2018.\n\nAs the air traffic controllers were deemed essential employees, they were required to work without pay.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents air traffic controllers, filed a lawsuit against the federal government for the shutdown on January 11, 2019, claiming that requiring 16,000 air traffic controllers to work without being paid violated their constitutional rights and federal minimum wage law.That was the third lawsuit filed against the federal government since the beginning of the shutdown.\n\nAirline and aircraft safety inspectors, on the other hand, were deemed nonessential and furloughed.A news report on January 12, 2019, stated that the Federal Aviation Administration had returned 500 furloughed safety inspectors back to work and would return more to work in the following weeks.As the airline and aircraft safety inspectors were furloughed, the certification process of the Airbus A220 in the US was stalled.Delta Air Lines was forced to delay the launch of the new aircraft, and to use other models of aircraft to serve those routes that was supposed to be served with A220.Many TSA employees also called out sick, most of them because they were trying to find other jobs that would provide immediate paychecks.\n\nThe shutdown initially prevented the National Transportation Safety Board from assisting the Mexican government\'s investigation of the 2018 Puebla helicopter crash that killed a state governor and senator; an exception allowed the NTSB to assist with the Mexican government in the investigation along with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.The NTSB also had to delay several investigations until the government reopened and only continued investigations into accidents that were considered the most serious.Issues in receiving certification and oversight from the FAA led to a month-long delay in the commencement of passenger service at Paine Field in Everett, Washington.\n\nAs the shutdown continued into its fourth week, the unions representing airline pilots, flight attendants and air traffic controllers issued a statement asserting, ""we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play"" because of the shutdown.\n\nSome airports such as the Philadelphia International Airport, launched food and item donations for federal employees who were affected by the shutdown.Other airports such as the Miami International Airport, and the George Bush International Airport, closed down terminals in order to spread out the TSA workers that were available.\n\nOn January 25, flights destined for LaGuardia Airport in New York were halted to a groundstop by FAA officials due to staffing shortages directly as a result of the shutdown.As a result, several flights to and from neighboring airports in the Northeast, specifically Philadelphia and Newark, suffered significant delays of their own.Soon after that, appropriations passed and the government reopened.\n\nThe shutdown delayed software updates to the Boeing 737 MAX airplane which may have caused the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.\n\nDuring the shutdown, court-appointed private lawyers who represent indigent defendants worked without pay.The Federal Judiciary initially had a goal of sustaining paid operations through January 18, 2019.It said it would run out of money to sustain court operations no earlier than January 25, but perhaps as late as February 1.Failing funding, the Judiciary would operate under the terms of the Antideficiency Act.This Act does not allow federal agencies to expend federal funds before an appropriation, nor to accept any voluntary services.The judiciary had 33,000 employees nationwide.Under the Constitution, Supreme Court Justices, appeals court judges and district judges would continue to be paid.\n\nThe shutdown caused many delays and disruptions in cases.Budgets were watched carefully to be able to pay public defenders, DNA testing, informants, and travel costs to interview victims and witnesses.Staffing issues also brought about concerns and constraints with prisons lacking the staff to safely hold attorney-client visits, and caused a delay in bail hearings.\n\nAgents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed in a report released on January 22, 2019, by the FBI Agents Association, that several different investigations were compromised by the shutdown.The report was called ""Voices from the Field"" and was 72 pages long.FBI agents were unable to pay Confidential Human Sources which risks losing that informant permanently.Some FBI divisions no longer have Spanish-speaking staff on hand and could not work with informants who only speak Spanish.Some agents reported that they did not have the funds to assist in joint operations with local law enforcement.\n\nFederal law enforcement agencies working on Native American land worked without pay through the shutdown.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was forced to cancel a trip to the United States/Mexico border in early January due to the shutdown.DHS was also unable to inspect Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities during the shutdown to ensure that immigrants were being held in facilities appropriately.During the shutdown, the federal government\'s e-Verify system—a system for employers to check the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States—was halted.\n\nDuring the shutdown, a wave of Domain Name System (DNS) attacks on government sites was detected by Homeland Security.The attacks were serious because these Internet sites could be hijacked.\n\nOfficial websites for agencies were rendered insecure or inaccessible through the shutdown, as the expired digital certificates were not renewed.On January 23, DHS asked all government agencies to secure their DNS records; however, many agencies were not able to respond quickly to this request.\n\nExecutive and legislative affairs of the local government of the District of Columbia continued operating through the shutdown, due to a provision previously enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017.The District\'s local court system, including the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, are part of the federal judiciary.Thus, they were partially shut down, preventing District residents from accessing services such as marriage licensing.The District of Columbia government said it would take over trash collection and snow plowing operations for National Park Service facilities in Washington.\n\nThe shutdown also interfered with the response to the 2018 Sunda Strait tsunami, as the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta\'s Twitter account was unable to tweet updates, and the United States Geological Survey was unable to provide data on the tsunami.The American weather model, the GFS, suffered a significant drop in forecast quality when a data format change during the shutdown prevented certain weather data from being recognized by the GFS, and the shutdown prevented the bug from being corrected.\n\nBy mid-day Thursday, January 3, 2019, the FCC had suspended operations.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai canceled his trip to the Consumer Electronics Show.The FTC also suspended certain online operations.The EPA and Department of Energy\'s Energy Star website was not available for the duration of the shutdown.\n\nMakers of alcoholic beverages were unable to receive approval from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau for new labels and recipes during the shutdown.\n\nBased on the recalculation of their operating reserves, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) would have had to cease patent operations in the second week of February.A cadre of personnel was allocated to continue receiving patent applications, receive payments, and maintain the IT infrastructure.Even though the USPTO is self-funded, a Congressional appropriation is required to permit the USPTO to spend money.The pipeline of patent applications at the time took 15.8 months for a response from an examiner.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution shortened to two days and downscaled its scheduled ten-day 2019 Folklife Festival on the National Mall because of the shutdown\'s effects.Sabrina Motley, the director of the festival, said that initially, crucial funding for the June—July event arrived later than expected, slowing preparations.Motley stated: ""The government opened back up, but it took a while for systems to come back online. ...We looked at our production schedule, and it became clear we would need more time than we had.""\n\nThe White House residence staff who stage public receptions were among those furloughed, with a minimal staff continuing to work unpaid for the first family.In the midst of the shutdown Trump invited the Clemson Tigers football team to a White House dinner reception on January 14 in recognition of their College Football Playoff National Championship win.On the morning of the reception Trump announced that he intended to serve fast food hamburgers and pizza to the team, a remark that some commentators interpreted as a joke.That evening Trump welcomed the team in the State Dining Room with a buffet of fast food and pizza from McDonald\'s, Wendy\'s and other restaurant chains, which he stated that he had paid for personally.Trump served fast food to other visiting athletes later that year, after the shutdown had ended.\n\nOn January 10, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with several other unions, announced plans to protest the government shutdown at 1:00pm EST in Washington, DC.Leaders of the National Federation of Federal Employees stated they had hoped that bringing federal workers to the President\'s doorstep would show him that it was the individual workers that the shutdown was hurting the most.President Trump had left to visit the US–Mexican border in Texas earlier in the day.\n\nSimilar protests took place in Philadelphia and St. Louis, among other cities.On January 15, representatives for Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, and Vietnam Veterans of America along with others called for an end to shutdown, but avoided placing any blame on political parties.\n\nShortly after the protests, the American Federation of Government Employees sued the Trump administration to challenge the arrangements for work without pay during the shutdown.A similar suit was raised and won during the 2013 Federal Government shutdown.The National Air Traffic Controllers Association also sued the Trump administration, as the shutdown allegedly violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by failing to pay the workers at least a minimum wage during the shutdown.\n\nAs the salaries for members of Congress are written into permanent law and not funded through annual appropriations, the government shutdown did not affect their salaries.Senators and Representatives were still paid their biweekly salaries of $6,700 towards at least $174,000 a year.\n\nSeveral Democratic and Republican Senators and Representatives said they would donate or refuse their salary during the shutdown.Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw stated that he would refuse his salary, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto indicated she would donate hers to a Nevada charity, Senator Mazie Hirono said she would donate her salary to Hawaii food banks, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would give hers to refugee non-profit HIAS, New York Congressman Max Rose stated that he would give his salary to charity and outgoing Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota pledged hers to charity, along with her Republican colleague John Hoeven.Republican senator Kevin Cramer, who defeated Heidi Heitkamp in the 2018 midterm elections, refused to donate his salary, calling the move ""gimmicky"".Representative Brian Fitzpatrick urged all members of Congress to decline their paychecks.He said, ""If you\'re in Congress, don\'t just delay your pay -- forfeit it, write a check back to the US Treasury.Then you\'ll feel the pain of federal workers.""\n\nBy January 17, 2019, 102 members of Congress—20 Senators and 82 Representatives— chose to decline their paychecks or were donating their paychecks to charity.\n\nDuring the shutdown, many federal workers used food banks and food pantries in order to feed themselves and their families.Many food pantries waived certain restrictions in order to help government workers have access to food.During the shutdown, the Salvation Army Emergency Disasters Services program provided meals for federal workers.Chef Jose Andres created the #ChefsForFeds program to feed federal workers in Washington, D.C. and by January 21, made announcements to expand the program nationwide.\n\nSome states such as California, offered furloughed employees unemployment benefits, although the Trump administration allegedly told states that they could not do so with federal funds.Organizations such as state Attorney Generals offices, and credit card companies posted statements to their websites to offer a means to help to consolidate debt, meet mortgages or other payments such as child support or tuition.An employment law firm offered pro bono legal advice to furloughed federal employees.School districts opened up free or reduced lunch options for children of federal employees, and looked into other options to aid parents amid concerns that financial stress at home would adversely affect families and children.Every mainline denomination in America has contributed to efforts to provide relief.One Baptist church emptied its entire disaster fund to aid federal employees.\n\nOn January 24, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross downplayed the financial difficulties faced by the 800,000 federal workers affected by the shutdown, stating that they should borrow money to ""tide them over"" until the shutdown ends.Critics and Democrats criticized the statement as inappropriate, noting that Ross\' own net worth is estimated at almost $700 million, accusing him of being out of touch with the workers.Ross also said that he ""did not understand"" why people who were not getting paid due to the shutdown were visiting food banks.When asked about Ross\' statement, Trump suggested that grocery stores will ""work along"" with the government by voluntarily extending credit to those who are out of funds to buy food.National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow characterized the shutdown as a ""glitch"" and suggested that federal workers who were required to work without pay were ""volunteering"" to work for their love of the country and ""presumably their allegiance to President Trump.""\n\nIn a video message to staff, FBI director Christopher Wray stated, ""Making some people stay home when they don\'t want to, and making others show up without pay, it\'s mind-boggling, it\'s shortsighted and it\'s unfair.It takes a lot to get me angry, but I\'m about as angry as I\'ve been in a long, long time.""\n\nLara Trump, a daughter-in-law of the President, drew outrage after an interview in which she stated that while ""It\'s not fair to you..."" the shutdown was ""...a little bit of pain, but it\'s going to be for the future of our country, and their children and their grandchildren and generations after them will thank them for their sacrifice right now.""Her comments drew criticism by politicians, celebrities, and the general public who felt the advisor and spokeswoman for the Trump 2020 campaign was out of touch, however Lara Trump later claimed the comments were taken out of context.\n\nIn January 2019, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that 56% of the responding public opposed a wall while 39% favored it, and 45% viewed the situation at the border as a crisis.The numbers were similar to the poll in December 2018 yet a later poll by ABC News showed that as the partial shutdown entered its fourth week support for building a wall was increasing.A poll done through YouGov between December 23–25, 2018, reported that 51% of respondents thought Trump deserved ""a lot"" of the blame, 44% thought congressional Democrats and 39% thought congressional Republicans.Similar results were reported by a December 21–25 survey done by Reuters and Ipsos in which 47% of respondents said that the shutdown was the President\'s fault and 33% blamed Congressional Democrats.\n\nOver the course of the shutdown, Trump\'s approval rating marginally declined while his disapproval rating marginally increased.His net approval rating was by the middle of January 2019 at its lowest point since February 2018.On December 27, 2018, it was reported that Trump\'s approval rating of registered voters was at 39%, with 56% disapproval.Broken down the rating was split across party lines, with Republicans

multiple warehouses for hazardous goods, a fire pump and a fire pond.\n\nThe warehouse building, owned by Ruihai Logistics, is recorded in a 2014 government document as being a hazardous chemical storage facility for calcium carbide, sodium nitrate, and potassium nitrate.Safety regulations requiring that public buildings and facilities should be at least 1 kilometre away were not followed, and local inhabitants were unaware of the danger.The authorities stated that poor record keeping, damage to the office facilities and ""major discrepancies"" with customs meant that they were unable to identify the substances stored.State media revealed that Ruihai had only received its authorisation to handle dangerous chemicals less than two months earlier, meaning that it had been operating illegally from October 2014, when its temporary license had expired, to June 2015.\n\nThe first reports of a fire at a warehouse in the Binhai New Area began coming in at around 22:50 local time (14:50 UTC) on 12 August.The first responders were unable to keep the fire from spreading.Firefighters who first arrived on the scene proceeded to douse the fire with water as they were unaware that dangerous chemicals were stored on the site, thereby setting in motion a series of more violent chemical reactions.\n\nAt around 23:30 (15:30 UTC), the first explosion occurred and registered as a magnitude 2.3 earthquake, generating seismic shock-waves energetically equivalent to 2.9 tonnes of TNT.After 30 seconds, a second violent explosion occurred, causing most of the damage and injuries with shock-waves felt many kilometres away.The second explosion registered as a magnitude 2.9 earthquake and generated seismic shock-waves with energy equivalent to 21.9 tonnes of TNT.The resulting fireballs reached hundreds of meters in height.Around 23:40 (15:40 UTC) on 15 August, a series of eight smaller explosions occurred in the port as fire from the original blasts continued to spread.The total energy release was equivalent to 28 tonnes of TNT, or 100GJ.\n\nThe explosion was large enough to be photographed by Himawari, a geostationary meteorological satellite operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).Chinese scientists subsequently estimated that the second more powerful explosion involved the detonation of about 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, based on crater size and lethality radius (336 tons TNT equivalent, based on relative effectiveness factor of 0.42).\n\nOne month after the explosion, official reports listed 173 deaths and 797 injuries.Media reported the area to be densely populated, with around 5,600 families living within radius of the plant, the closest being only away.Neither the developers nor the buyers were aware of the latent dangers of the activities at the nearby site; developers claimed also to be victims.According to the Tianjin government, more than 700 people were injured by the explosion, many with extensive injuries, mostly from burns and explosive blast injuries.Over a thousand firefighters were on scene, and 95 were killed.One surviving firefighter from his team, a 19-year-old named ZhouTi (), was found on the morning of 14 August.The death toll, which also included 11 police officers, was the worst in a single incident for Chinese front line responders since the founding of the People\'s Republic of China in 1949.\n\nPhotographs and videos showed extensive destruction in and around the warehouse compound, with an enormous crater at the blast site.The buildings of seven more surrounding logistics companies were destroyed, and large quantities of intermodal container stacks were toppled and thrown by the forces of the explosions.More than eight thousand new cars from Hyundai, Kia, Volkswagen, Renault, and Toyota, parked in lots located near the blast site, were largely burned as a result of the initial explosions.Multiple buildings surrounding the blast site were declared ""structurally unsafe"".In total, 304 buildings, 12,428 cars, and 7,533 intermodal containers were damaged.Beyond insurance, the cost to businesses of the break in the supply chain caused by the explosions was estimated at $9 billion, making it the third most expensive supply chain disruption of 2015.\n\nApartment blocks from the site sustained shattered glass, loss of roof tiles and damage to ceilings – with 17,000 units being affected.Nearby Donghai Road Station suffered severe damage as a result of the explosions and was closed until 2016, as was the rest of Line 9 of the Tianjin Metro beginning on 13 August.A Japanese department store four kilometres away reported damage to walls and ceilings.The explosions also affected the National Supercomputing Center of Tianjin several kilometres away, knocking out windows and causing some internal ceilings to collapse; the center\'s supercomputer Tianhe-1A itself was not damaged.\n\nIt is not known what chemicals were being stored at the site.In addition to vast quantities of sodium cyanide and calcium carbide, paperwork was discovered showing that 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate and 500 tonnes of potassium nitrate were at the blast site.On 17 August, the deputy director of the public security bureau\'s fire department told CCTV:\n\nAmmonium nitrate, which is predominantly used as an agricultural fertilizer, oxidizing agent in explosive compositions, and in manufacturing of other chemicals, has been the cause of a number of other fatal industrial explosions.A fire department spokesman confirmed that firefighters had used water in combating the initial fire, which may have led to water being sprayed on calcium carbide, releasing the highly flammable gas acetylene.This would have provided the fuel source for reaction with the oxidizer, ammonium nitrate, thus triggering its detonation more readily.\n\nAt least 700 tonnes of highly toxic sodium cyanide was stored at the site – 70 times the legal limit.Sodium cyanide leakage was reported in the sewer.On 13 August, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, all of which are toxic, were detected within of the origin of the explosion, but the levels conformed with the national standards.Gases were undetectable from the site during initial testing on 14 August.\n\nWhen the first rains after the initial explosions arrived on 18 August, white chemical foam covered the streets.Citizens complained of burning sensations and rashes on sensitive skin regions after coming into contact with rain droplets.However, meteorologists and health experts sought to reassure the public that the rain was not directly harmful to health, whilst the Environment Protection Board advised against exposure to the rain due to traces of cyanide dust reacting with water.\n\nThousands of dead sticklebacks washed up on the banks 6 km from the explosion site on 20 August, fuelling fears of water contamination.Officials downplayed the fears, saying that there were not high levels of cyanide in the river and that the fish likely died due to oxygen depletion in the water.\n\nMore precipitation throughout August in the Binhai New Area brought more complaints of skin irritations and burns from volunteers and journalists.A bright white foam manifested yet again on the streets in a similar manner to before.Deng Xiaowen, director of Tianjin\'s environmental monitoring centre, stated that the foam was ""a normal phenomenon when rain falls, and similar things have occurred before"".\n\nOn Thursday morning, the Chinese leaders ordered officers in the city to make full effort in rescuing the injured, and search for those missing.Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and Li Keqiang, the Premier of the People\'s Republic of China, instructed police to investigate the cause of the incident and punish those responsible for the blast.\n\nTianjin officials, concerned at the potential public response, announced initially that fourteen people had perished in the explosions, but later raised the death toll to forty-four once the scale of the explosions became clear.The South China Morning Post (SCMP) cited a Tianjin police source that officers had been instructed to remove bodies from the scene to deliberately understate the official death toll, which angered the Tianjin government.\n\nThe morning following the explosion, military personnel began to arrive in Tianjin to help with the search and recovery efforts.Extra equipment, such as bulldozers, were brought in to help with the clean-up operation.Over 200 nuclear and biochemical experts, including a team from the International Atomic Energy Agency, began arriving in Tianjin to assess the health risks from the chemicals being released into the atmosphere.Government personnel set up twelve temporary monitoring stations near the blast site with above-normal levels of pollutants being detected.A nearby drainage outlet was also closed, and water quality tested.\n\nFirefighting was suspended on the afternoon of 13 August due to the uncertainty of the content and quantity of hazardous materials being stored on site.A team of over two hundred chemical specialists was deployed to assess the hazardous materials on site and dangers to the environment, and to determine the best way to put out the remaining fires and proceed with search and rescue and clean-up operations.Later that day, rescue personnel were dispatched in an attempt to remove the 700 tonnes of sodium cyanide believed to be stored at the site, with hydrogen peroxide being prepared to neutralise the chemicals.Daily press conferences were organised.A press conference organised by local officials held on 14 August came to an abrupt end when a journalist began asking questions as to why such dangerous chemicals were stockpiled so close to housing estates.\n\nInitially, more than 3,500 area residents were staying in temporary shelters, but the number surpassed 6,000 within three days.The government issued an evacuation order over concerns of further explosions; not all residents complied.\n\nOn 15 August, local authorities ordered the evacuation of residents within a radius of the blast site, prompted by the threat of ""toxic substances"", including sodium cyanide.\n\nThe State Council ordered inspections of all businesses using dangerous chemicals and explosives across the country.\n\nHong Kong media announced that Li Liang, the major shareholder of Ruihai Logistics – owning 55%, was the nephew of former chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and ex-party chief of Tianjin, Li Ruihuan, and that the company may have been named after his brother and Li Liang\'s father; the remaining 45% was owned by Shu Zheng.Reports in state media one week after the explosion were contradictory, holding that Ruihai was owned via proxies by Yu Xuewei, the chairman of Ruihai and a former senior executive at Sinochem, and Dong Shexuan, who served as the company\'s vice-president and who had been arrested by police by the time of the reports.Dong Shexuan is the son of Tianjin port\'s former police chief Dong Peijun, who was a colleague of Wu Changshun, the former chief of the public security bureau of Tianjin.The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), CPC\'s anti-corruption body, charged Wu Changshun with bribery in 2014; Dong Peijun was also under investigation for corruption, but died that year.\n\nAfter the explosions, the CCDI placed Yang Dongliang, Director of the State Administration of Work Safety and China\'s highest work-safety official, under investigation on 18 August 2015.Yang had previously served as Tianjin\'s vice mayor for 11 years.In 2012, Yang Dongliang had issued an order to loosen rules for the handling of hazardous substances, which may have enabled Ruihai to store toxic chemicals such as sodium cyanide.\n\nOn 27 August, Xinhua reported that police had arrested twelve people with suspected connections to the explosions, including Ruihai Logistics\' chairman, vice-chairman, and at least three other managers, with the other seven people unnamed.\n\nOn 5 February 2016, the Chinese government issued the investigation report of the explosions.The report concluded the fire started in a container through auto-ignition of nitrocellulose, due to vaporization of the wetting agent during hot weather.\n\nOn 8 November 2016, various courts in China handed jail sentences to 49 government officials and warehouse executives and staff for their roles in circumventing the safety rules that led to the disaster.Yu Xuewei, the Chairman of Ruihai Logistics, was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve.\n\nImmediately following the blasts, the company website was taken down, fuelling suspicions that an attempt was being made to shield owners with powerful political connections.For several days, local residents seeking compensation for their homes protested in front of the venue of the daily press conference.They were joined by distraught families of missing firefighters and confronted police angrily.\n\nThe Chinese public security minister threatened severe punishment for those found to be responsible for the explosions.However, the authorities did not release any significant information for several days about the chemicals and circumstances, causing public anger to mount during this time.Marking an official change of tack that suggested top-level endorsement, the official People\'s Daily joined in to criticise local officials\' lack of candour and their use of bureaucratic jargon.In addition, the Global Times remarked on the inadequacy of emergency response and the reluctance of high-ranking officials to answer the public\'s questions or address their concerns until four days after the blasts.The People\'s Daily acknowledged that public scepticism of the reported death toll was fuelling rampant rumours; there was disquiet over the emergency assistance provided and the way the aftermath was being handled.Attempting to defuse widespread anger at the lack of official transparency, mouthpieces of the ruling party declared that investigations would be thorough and transparent.Former deputy mayor Yang Dongliang was put under investigation for corruption; mayor Huang Xingguo proclaimed his ""unshirkable responsibility for this accident"".Authorities released information about the ownership of Ruihai, as well as a confession by one beneficial owner for the proxy shareholdings.\n\nMeanwhile, Greenpeace Asia alleged that two Sinochem subsidiaries – Sinochem Tianjin Binhai Logistics Company (with a site) and Tianjin Port Sinochem Hazardous Goods Logistics Company Ltd. – had warehouses in the vicinity in close proximity to a primary and a nursery school, meaning that both were in similar breach of laws.\n\nObservers stated that top officials always attempt to show such disasters as isolated instances, have never accepted political accountability nor addressed the underlying governance issues, and have always heavily censored any criticism of the central government.Willy Lam, professor at CUHK and senior fellow at The Jamestown Foundation, noted the highly unusual period of four days it took for Li Keqiang to make an official visit, suggesting that the lack of a top-ranking visitor to a major disaster site within forty-eight hours despite the proximity to Beijing reflected ""division among the leadership on who should be the fall guy.""\n\nInitially, Tianjin authorities banned editors and reporters from sharing information about the disaster on Weibo and WeChat, and websites were ordered to follow state media.\n\nThe Tianjin internet police warned social media users to use only official casualty figures.\n\nTianjin Television had reported the explosion on their early morning news at 7:00 am, but citizens complained that the station had not reported live nor updated on the event, instead showing soap operas eight hours later.\n\nA great deal of specific information on the event, including the majority of early stage video, was first released over social media sites, and in particular microblogging platforms like Weibo.Major media has drawn heavily from social media sources, greatly widening the audience.The Economist noted, ""Social media fills in the blanks left by official narratives of the Tianjin disaster.The most remarkable feature of the aftermath of the explosions in Tianjin, in Northern China, has been the extraordinary contrast between the official reaction to the crisis, which has been profoundly flawed, and the online reaction, which has entirely dominated the agenda.""\n\nProfessional and social media reports were censored by Chinese authorities.The censorship rate increased tenfold on the social media site Weibo, with users reporting the deletion of their posts regarding the blasts, with ""Tianjin"" and ""explosion"" being the most censored words.An article by Caijing, which carried an interview with a firefighter who said that no-one on the front line had been informed of the dangerous chemicals on site that would react exothermically when mixed with water, was deleted after it had been reposted 10,000 times; many other posts mentioning the existence of deadly sodium cyanide were also expunged.\n\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China banned all journalists from posting to social media, and insisted on strict adherence to Xinhua\'s editorial line.On 15 August, it announced that it had shut down 18 websites and suspended 32 more for spreading false information.More than 360 Weibo and public WeChat accounts which had allegedly been spreading such false rumors have been ""punished according to laws"".Of these accounts, over 160 were shut down permanently.\n\nPress freedom organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF) accused the Chinese state media of playing up the heroic efforts of rescue workers and firefighters while downplaying the causes of the explosions and the number of casualties.RSF said that censorship by the Chinese authorities showed ""a flagrant indifference to the public\'s legitimate concerns"".\n\nA CNN correspondent was interrupted by bystanders and forced to leave during a live report outside TEDA Hospital.A journalist from the Beijing News reported that he and two other reporters were chased by police, caught, searched, and made to delete photographs from their cameras and computers.\n\nTianjin officials announced that as at the deadline on 3 September 2015, more than 9,000 households out of some 17,000 affected by the explosions had signed agreements to settle their damages claims.It was reported that some had chosen to sell their damaged apartments to private developers, who offered them around 130% of the original purchase price, while others accepted an offer from the local government promising to fix the damaged apartments.The local government offered an additional of ¥20,000 renminbi ($3,100) to those who agreed to settle their claims by the deadline.The New York Times journalists, however, reported that some owners had faced heavy pressure from government officials to settle; similarly, owners who were employees in state-owned enterprises were under threat of dismissal from their bosses for not settling.\n\nOn 10 September 2015 China Daily reported that families of the firefighters killed in the explosions would each receive compensation of 2.3 million yuan (US$360,669), citing a report in Beijing News.It was reported that a monument would be built on the site and that the government planned to compensate residents whose houses were damaged by repurchasing them at 130% of their purchase price.\n\nLess than a month after the disaster, the Tianjin government announced a proposal to turn the site into an ""ecological park"", repurposing the explosion crater as a lake and promising a memorial to the victims to be built on site.The proposal was heavily criticized on Chinese social media, which derided the rushed announcement as an attempt to erase the damage and avoid accountability.The resulting , opened in early 2017, was further criticized for being an extremely rushed and sloppy design.Both the crater lake and the proposed memorial were ultimately discarded; as a result, there is currently no permanent memorial to the disaster.\n\n2023 Yinchuan gas explosion 2020 Beirut explosion 2019 Xiangshui chemical plant explosion 2015 Dongying explosion 2014 Shanghai stampede 2014 Kunshan explosion 1988 PEPCON

reports, and injured hundreds of others.The explosions occurred at a container storage station in the Binhai New Area of Tianjin, China.The first two explosions occurred 33 seconds apart.The second explosion was much larger and involved the detonation of about 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate (approx.256 tonnes TNT equivalent).Fires caused by the initial explosions continued to burn uncontrolled throughout the weekend, resulting in eight additional explosions on 15 August.\n\nThe cause of the explosions was not immediately known, but an investigation concluded in February 2016 that an overheated container of dry nitrocellulose was the cause of the initial explosion.The official casualty report was 173 deaths, eight missing, and 798 non-fatal injuries.Of the 173 fatalities, 104 were firefighters.\n\nTianjin Dongjiang Port Ruihai International Logistics (), or Ruihai Logistics (), is a privately held logistics company established in 2011.It handled hazardous chemicals within the Port of Tianjin, such as flammable and corrosive substances, oxidizing agents, and toxic chemicals.The company, which employed 70, was designated by the Tianjin Maritime Safety Administration () as an approved agent for handling these hazardous chemicals at the port, and its operating license was renewed two months prior to the explosions.Its site, roughly the size of two city blocks, contained multiple warehouses for hazardous goods, a fire pump and a fire pond.\n\nThe warehouse building, owned by Ruihai Logistics, is recorded in a 2014 government document as being a hazardous chemical storage facility for calcium carbide, sodium nitrate, and potassium nitrate.Safety regulations requiring that public buildings and facilities should be at least 1 kilometre away were not followed, and local inhabitants were unaware of the danger.The authorities stated that poor record keeping, damage to the office facilities and ""major discrepancies"" with customs meant that they were unable to identify the substances stored.State media revealed that Ruihai had only received its authorisation to handle dangerous chemicals less than two months earlier, meaning that it had been operating illegally from October 2014, when its temporary license had expired, to June 2015.\n\nThe first reports of a fire at a warehouse in the Binhai New Area began coming in at around 22:50 local time

area to be densely populated, with around 5,600 families living within radius of the plant, the closest being only away.Neither the developers nor the buyers were aware of the latent dangers of the activities at the nearby site; developers claimed also to be victims.According to the Tianjin government, more than 700 people were injured by the explosion, many with extensive injuries, mostly from burns and explosive blast injuries.Over a thousand firefighters were on scene, and 95 were killed.One surviving firefighter from his team, a 19-year-old named ZhouTi (), was found on the morning of 14 August.The death toll, which also included 11 police officers, was the worst in a single incident for Chinese front line responders since the founding of the People\'s Republic of China in 1949.\n\nPhotographs and videos showed extensive destruction in and around the warehouse compound, with an enormous crater at the blast site.The buildings of seven more surrounding logistics companies were destroyed, and large quantities of intermodal container stacks were toppled and thrown by the forces of the explosions.More than eight thousand new cars from Hyundai, Kia, Volkswagen, Renault, and Toyota, parked in lots located near the blast site, were largely burned as a result of the initial explosions.Multiple buildings surrounding the blast site were declared ""structurally unsafe"".In total, 304 buildings, 12,428 cars, and 7,533 intermodal containers were damaged.Beyond insurance, the cost to businesses of the break in the supply chain caused by the explosions was estimated at $9 billion, making it the third most expensive supply chain disruption of 2015.\n\nApartment blocks from the site sustained shattered glass, loss of roof tiles and damage to ceilings – with 17,000 units being affected.Nearby Donghai Road Station suffered severe damage as a result of the explosions and was closed until 2016, as was the rest of Line 9 of the Tianjin Metro beginning on 13 August.A Japanese department store four kilometres away reported damage to walls and ceilings.The explosions also affected the National Supercomputing Center of Tianjin several kilometres away, knocking out windows and causing some internal ceilings to collapse; the center\'s supercomputer Tianhe-1A itself was not damaged.\n\nIt is not known what chemicals were being stored at the site.In addition to vast quantities of sodium cyanide and calcium carbide, paperwork was discovered showing that 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate and 500 tonnes of potassium nitrate were at the blast site.On 17 August, the

set up twelve temporary monitoring stations near the blast site with above-normal levels of pollutants being detected.A nearby drainage outlet was also closed, and water quality tested.\n\nFirefighting was suspended on the afternoon of 13 August due to the uncertainty of the content and quantity of hazardous materials being stored on site.A team of over two hundred chemical specialists was deployed to assess the hazardous materials on site and dangers to the environment, and to determine the best way to put out the remaining fires and proceed with search and rescue and clean-up operations.Later that day, rescue personnel were dispatched in an attempt to remove the 700 tonnes of sodium cyanide believed to be stored at the site, with hydrogen peroxide being prepared to neutralise the chemicals.Daily press conferences were organised.A press conference organised by local officials held on 14 August came to an abrupt end when a journalist began asking questions as to why such dangerous chemicals were stockpiled so close to housing estates.\n\nInitially, more than 3,500 area residents were staying in temporary shelters, but the number surpassed 6,000 within three days.The government issued an evacuation order over concerns of further explosions; not all residents complied.\n\nOn 15 August, local authorities ordered the evacuation of residents within a radius of the blast site, prompted by the threat of ""toxic substances"", including sodium cyanide.\n\nThe State Council ordered inspections of all businesses using dangerous chemicals and explosives across the country.\n\nHong Kong media announced that Li Liang, the major shareholder of Ruihai Logistics – owning 55%, was the nephew of former chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and ex-party chief of Tianjin, Li Ruihuan, and that the company may have been named after his brother and Li Liang\'s father; the remaining 45% was owned by Shu Zheng.Reports in state media one week after the explosion were contradictory, holding that Ruihai was owned via proxies by Yu Xuewei, the chairman of Ruihai and a former senior executive at Sinochem, and Dong Shexuan, who served as the company\'s vice-president and who had been arrested by police by the time of the reports.Dong Shexuan is the son of Tianjin port\'s former police chief Dong Peijun, who was a colleague of Wu Changshun, the former chief of the public security bureau of Tianjin.The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), CPC\'s anti-corruption body, charged Wu Changshun with bribery in 2014; Dong Peijun was also under investigation for corruption, but died that year.\n\nAfter the explosions, the CCDI placed Yang Dongliang, Director of the State Administration of Work Safety and China\'s highest work-safety official, under investigation on 18 August 2015.Yang had previously served as Tianjin\'s vice mayor for 11 years.In 2012, Yang Dongliang had issued an order to loosen rules for the handling of hazardous substances, which may have enabled Ruihai to store toxic chemicals such as sodium cyanide.\n\nOn 27 August, Xinhua reported that police had arrested twelve people with suspected connections to the explosions, including Ruihai Logistics\' chairman, vice-chairman, and at least three other managers, with the other seven people unnamed.\n\nOn 5 February 2016, the Chinese

Sinochem subsidiaries – Sinochem Tianjin Binhai Logistics Company (with a site) and Tianjin Port Sinochem Hazardous Goods Logistics Company Ltd. – had warehouses in the vicinity in close proximity to a primary and a nursery school, meaning that both were in similar breach of laws.\n\nObservers stated that top officials always attempt to show such disasters as isolated instances, have never accepted political accountability nor addressed the underlying governance issues, and have always heavily censored any criticism of the central government.Willy Lam, professor at CUHK and senior fellow at The Jamestown Foundation, noted the highly unusual period of four days it took for Li Keqiang to make an official visit, suggesting that the lack of a top-ranking visitor to a major disaster site within forty-eight hours despite the proximity to Beijing reflected ""division among the leadership on who should be the fall guy.""\n\nInitially, Tianjin authorities banned editors and reporters from sharing information about the disaster on Weibo and WeChat, and websites were ordered to follow state media.\n\nThe Tianjin internet police warned social media users to use only official casualty figures.\n\nTianjin Television had reported the explosion on their early morning news at 7:00 am, but citizens complained that the station had not reported live nor updated on the event, instead showing soap operas eight hours later.\n\nA great deal of specific information on the event, including the majority of early stage video, was first released over social media sites, and in particular microblogging platforms like Weibo.Major media has drawn heavily from social media sources, greatly widening the audience.The Economist noted, ""Social media fills in the blanks left by official narratives of the Tianjin disaster.The most remarkable feature of the aftermath of the explosions in Tianjin, in Northern China, has been the extraordinary contrast between the official reaction to the crisis, which has been profoundly flawed, and the online reaction, which has entirely dominated the agenda.""\n\nProfessional and social media reports were censored by Chinese authorities.The censorship rate increased tenfold on the social media site Weibo, with users reporting the deletion of their posts regarding the blasts, with ""Tianjin"" and ""explosion"" being the most censored words.An article by Caijing, which carried an interview with a firefighter who said that no-one on the front line had been informed of the dangerous chemicals on site that would react exothermically when mixed with water, was deleted after it had been reposted 10,000 times; many other posts mentioning the existence of deadly sodium cyanide were also expunged.\n\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China banned all journalists from posting to social media, and insisted on strict adherence to Xinhua\'s editorial line.On 15 August, it announced that it had shut down 18 websites and suspended 32 more for spreading false information.More than 360 Weibo and public WeChat accounts which had allegedly been spreading such false rumors have been ""punished according to laws"".Of these accounts, over 160 were shut down permanently.\n\nPress freedom organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF) accused the Chinese state media of playing up the heroic efforts of rescue workers and firefighters while downplaying the causes of the explosions and the number of casualties.RSF said that censorship by the Chinese authorities showed ""a flagrant indifference to the public\'s legitimate concerns"".\n\nA CNN correspondent was interrupted by bystanders and forced to leave during a live report outside TEDA Hospital.A journalist from the Beijing News reported that he and two other reporters were chased by police, caught, searched, and made to delete photographs from their cameras and computers.\n\nTianjin officials announced that as at the deadline on 3 September 2015, more than 9,000 households out of some 17,000 affected by the explosions had signed agreements to settle their damages claims.It was reported that some had chosen to sell their damaged apartments to private developers, who offered them around 130% of the original purchase price, while others accepted an offer from the local government promising to fix the damaged apartments.The local government offered an additional of ¥20,000 renminbi ($3,100) to those who agreed to settle their claims by the deadline.The New York Times journalists, however, reported that some owners had faced heavy pressure from government officials to settle; similarly, owners who were employees in state-owned enterprises were under threat of dismissal from their bosses for not settling.\n\nOn 10 September 2015 China Daily reported that families of the firefighters killed in the explosions would each receive compensation of 2.3 million yuan (US$360,669), citing a report in Beijing News.It was reported that a monument would be built on the site and that the government planned to compensate residents whose houses were damaged by repurchasing them at 130% of their purchase price.\n\nLess than a month after the disaster, the Tianjin government announced a proposal to turn the site into an ""ecological park"", repurposing the explosion crater as a lake and promising a memorial to the victims to be built on site.The proposal was heavily criticized on Chinese social media, which derided the rushed announcement as an attempt to erase the damage and avoid accountability.The resulting , opened in early 2017, was further criticized for being an extremely rushed and sloppy design.Both the crater lake and the proposed memorial were ultimately discarded; as a result, there is currently no permanent memorial to the disaster.\n\n2023 Yinchuan gas explosion 2020 Beirut explosion 2019 Xiangshui chemical plant explosion 2015 Dongying explosion 2014 Shanghai stampede 2014 Kunshan explosion 1988 PEPCON

67,"{'Wiki_Title': '2015 Tianjin explosions', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'On 12 August 2015, a series of explosions at the Port of Tianjin in Tianjin, Northern China, killed 173 people, according to official reports, and injured hundreds of others.The explosions occurred at a container storage station in the Binhai New Area of Tianjin, China.The first two explosions occurred 33 seconds apart.The second explosion was much larger and involved the detonation of about 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate (approx.256 tonnes TNT equivalent).Fires caused by the initial explosions continued to burn uncontrolled throughout the weekend, resulting in eight additional explosions on 15 August.\n\nThe cause of the explosions was not immediately known, but an investigation concluded in February 2016 that an overheated container of dry nitrocellulose was the cause of the initial explosion.The official casualty report was 173 deaths, eight missing, and 798 non-fatal injuries.Of the 173 fatalities, 104 were firefighters.\n\nTianjin Dongjiang Port Ruihai International Logistics (), or Ruihai Logistics (), is a privately held logistics company established in 2011.It handled hazardous chemicals within the Port of Tianjin, such as flammable and corrosive substances, oxidizing agents, and toxic chemicals.The company, which employed 70, was designated by the Tianjin Maritime Safety Administration () as an approved agent for handling these hazardous chemicals at the port, and its operating license was renewed two months prior to the explosions.Its site, roughly the size of two city blocks, contained multiple warehouses for hazardous goods, a fire pump and a fire pond.\n\nThe warehouse building, owned by Ruihai Logistics, is recorded in a 2014 government document as being a hazardous chemical storage facility for calcium carbide, sodium nitrate, and potassium nitrate.Safety regulations requiring that public buildings and facilities should be at least 1 kilometre away were not followed, and local inhabitants were unaware of the danger.The authorities stated that poor record keeping, damage to the office facilities and ""major discrepancies"" with customs meant that they were unable to identify the substances stored.State media revealed that Ruihai had only received its authorisation to handle dangerous chemicals less than two months earlier, meaning that it had been operating illegally from October 2014, when its temporary license had expired, to June 2015.\n\nThe first reports of a fire at a warehouse in the Binhai New Area began coming in at around 22:50 local time (14:50 UTC) on 12 August.The first responders were unable to keep the fire from spreading.Firefighters who first arrived on the scene proceeded to douse the fire with water as they were unaware that dangerous chemicals were stored on the site, thereby setting in motion a series of more violent chemical reactions.\n\nAt around 23:30 (15:30 UTC), the first explosion occurred and registered as a magnitude 2.3 earthquake, generating seismic shock-waves energetically equivalent to 2.9 tonnes of TNT.After 30 seconds, a second violent explosion occurred, causing most of the damage and injuries with shock-waves felt many kilometres away.The second explosion registered as a magnitude 2.9 earthquake and generated seismic shock-waves with energy equivalent to 21.9 tonnes of TNT.The resulting fireballs reached hundreds of meters in height.Around 23:40 (15:40 UTC) on 15 August, a series of eight smaller explosions occurred in the port as fire from the original blasts continued to spread.The total energy release was equivalent to 28 tonnes of TNT, or 100GJ.\n\nThe explosion was large enough to be photographed by Himawari, a geostationary meteorological satellite operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).Chinese scientists subsequently estimated that the second more powerful explosion involved the detonation of about 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, based on crater size and lethality radius (336 tons TNT equivalent, based on relative effectiveness factor of 0.42).\n\nOne month after the explosion, official reports listed 173 deaths and 797 injuries.Media reported the area to be densely populated, with around 5,600 families living within radius of the plant, the closest being only away.Neither the developers nor the buyers were aware of the latent dangers of the activities at the nearby site; developers claimed also to be victims.According to the Tianjin government, more than 700 people were injured by the explosion, many with extensive injuries, mostly from burns and explosive blast injuries.Over a thousand firefighters were on scene, and 95 were killed.One surviving firefighter from his team, a 19-year-old named ZhouTi (), was found on the morning of 14 August.The death toll, which also included 11 police officers, was the worst in a single incident for Chinese front line responders since the founding of the People\'s Republic of China in 1949.\n\nPhotographs and videos showed extensive destruction in and around the warehouse compound, with an enormous crater at the blast site.The buildings of seven more surrounding logistics companies were destroyed, and large quantities of intermodal container stacks were toppled and thrown by the forces of the explosions.More than eight thousand new cars from Hyundai, Kia, Volkswagen, Renault, and Toyota, parked in lots located near the blast site, were largely burned as a result of the initial explosions.Multiple buildings surrounding the blast site were declared ""structurally unsafe"".In total, 304 buildings, 12,428 cars, and 7,533 intermodal containers were damaged.Beyond insurance, the cost to businesses of the break in the supply chain caused by the explosions was estimated at $9 billion, making it the third most expensive supply chain disruption of 2015.\n\nApartment blocks from the site sustained shattered glass, loss of roof tiles and damage to ceilings – with 17,000 units being affected.Nearby Donghai Road Station suffered severe damage as a result of the explosions and was closed until 2016, as was the rest of Line 9 of the Tianjin Metro beginning on 13 August.A Japanese department store four kilometres away reported damage to walls and ceilings.The explosions also affected the National Supercomputing Center of Tianjin several kilometres away, knocking out windows and causing some internal ceilings to collapse; the center\'s supercomputer Tianhe-1A itself was not damaged.\n\nIt is not known what chemicals were being stored at the site.In addition to vast quantities of sodium cyanide and calcium carbide, paperwork was discovered showing that 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate and 500 tonnes of potassium nitrate were at the blast site.On 17 August, the deputy director of the public security bureau\'s fire department told CCTV:\n\nAmmonium nitrate, which is predominantly used as an agricultural fertilizer, oxidizing agent in explosive compositions, and in manufacturing of other chemicals, has been the cause of a number of other fatal industrial explosions.A fire department spokesman confirmed that firefighters had used water in combating the initial fire, which may have led to water being sprayed on calcium carbide, releasing the highly flammable gas acetylene.This would have provided the fuel source for reaction with the oxidizer, ammonium nitrate, thus triggering its detonation more readily.\n\nAt least 700 tonnes of highly toxic sodium cyanide was stored at the site – 70 times the legal limit.Sodium cyanide leakage was reported in the sewer.On 13 August, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, all of which are toxic, were detected within of the origin of the explosion, but the levels conformed with the national standards.Gases were undetectable from the site during initial testing on 14 August.\n\nWhen the first rains after the initial explosions arrived on 18 August, white chemical foam covered the streets.Citizens complained of burning sensations and rashes on sensitive skin regions after coming into contact with rain droplets.However, meteorologists and health experts sought to reassure the public that the rain was not directly harmful to health, whilst the Environment Protection Board advised against exposure to the rain due to traces of cyanide dust reacting with water.\n\nThousands of dead sticklebacks washed up on the banks 6 km from the explosion site on 20 August, fuelling fears of water contamination.Officials downplayed the fears, saying that there were not high levels of cyanide in the river and that the fish likely died due to oxygen depletion in the water.\n\nMore precipitation throughout August in the Binhai New Area brought more complaints of skin irritations and burns from volunteers and journalists.A bright white foam manifested yet again on the streets in a similar manner to before.Deng Xiaowen, director of Tianjin\'s environmental monitoring centre, stated that the foam was ""a normal phenomenon when rain falls, and similar things have occurred before"".\n\nOn Thursday morning, the Chinese leaders ordered officers in the city to make full effort in rescuing the injured, and search for those missing.Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and Li Keqiang, the Premier of the People\'s Republic of China, instructed police to investigate the cause of the incident and punish those responsible for the blast.\n\nTianjin officials, concerned at the potential public response, announced initially that fourteen people had perished in the explosions, but later raised the death toll to forty-four once the scale of the explosions became clear.The South China Morning Post (SCMP) cited a Tianjin police source that officers had been instructed to remove bodies from the scene to deliberately understate the official death toll, which angered the Tianjin government.\n\nThe morning following the explosion, military personnel began to arrive in Tianjin to help with the search and recovery efforts.Extra equipment, such as bulldozers, were brought in to help with the clean-up operation.Over 200 nuclear and biochemical experts, including a team from the International Atomic Energy Agency, began arriving in Tianjin to assess the health risks from the chemicals being released into the atmosphere.Government personnel set up twelve temporary monitoring stations near the blast site with above-normal levels of pollutants being detected.A nearby drainage outlet was also closed, and water quality tested.\n\nFirefighting was suspended on the afternoon of 13 August due to the uncertainty of the content and quantity of hazardous materials being stored on site.A team of over two hundred chemical specialists was deployed to assess the hazardous materials on site and dangers to the environment, and to determine the best way to put out the remaining fires and proceed with search and rescue and clean-up operations.Later that day, rescue personnel were dispatched in an attempt to remove the 700 tonnes of sodium cyanide believed to be stored at the site, with hydrogen peroxide being prepared to neutralise the chemicals.Daily press conferences were organised.A press conference organised by local officials held on 14 August came to an abrupt end when a journalist began asking questions as to why such dangerous chemicals were stockpiled so close to housing estates.\n\nInitially, more than 3,500 area residents were staying in temporary shelters, but the number surpassed 6,000 within three days.The government issued an evacuation order over concerns of further explosions; not all residents complied.\n\nOn 15 August, local authorities ordered the evacuation of residents within a radius of the blast site, prompted by the threat of ""toxic substances"", including sodium cyanide.\n\nThe State Council ordered inspections of all businesses using dangerous chemicals and explosives across the country.\n\nHong Kong media announced that Li Liang, the major shareholder of Ruihai Logistics – owning 55%, was the nephew of former chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and ex-party chief of Tianjin, Li Ruihuan, and that the company may have been named after his brother and Li Liang\'s father; the remaining 45% was owned by Shu Zheng.Reports in state media one week after the explosion were contradictory, holding that Ruihai was owned via proxies by Yu Xuewei, the chairman of Ruihai and a former senior executive at Sinochem, and Dong Shexuan, who served as the company\'s vice-president and who had been arrested by police by the time of the reports.Dong Shexuan is the son of Tianjin port\'s former police chief Dong Peijun, who was a colleague of Wu Changshun, the former chief of the public security bureau of Tianjin.The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), CPC\'s anti-corruption body, charged Wu Changshun with bribery in 2014; Dong Peijun was also under investigation for corruption, but died that year.\n\nAfter the explosions, the CCDI placed Yang Dongliang, Director of the State Administration of Work Safety and China\'s highest work-safety official, under investigation on 18 August 2015.Yang had previously served as Tianjin\'s vice mayor for 11 years.In 2012, Yang Dongliang had issued an order to loosen rules for the handling of hazardous substances, which may have enabled Ruihai to store toxic chemicals such as sodium cyanide.\n\nOn 27 August, Xinhua reported that police had arrested twelve people with suspected connections to the explosions, including Ruihai Logistics\' chairman, vice-chairman, and at least three other managers, with the other seven people unnamed.\n\nOn 5 February 2016, the Chinese government issued the investigation report of the explosions.The report concluded the fire started in a container through auto-ignition of nitrocellulose, due to vaporization of the wetting agent during hot weather.\n\nOn 8 November 2016, various courts in China handed jail sentences to 49 government officials and warehouse executives and staff for their roles in circumventing the safety rules that led to the disaster.Yu Xuewei, the Chairman of Ruihai Logistics, was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve.\n\nImmediately following the blasts, the company website was taken down, fuelling suspicions that an attempt was being made to shield owners with powerful political connections.For several days, local residents seeking compensation for their homes protested in front of the venue of the daily press conference.They were joined by distraught families of missing firefighters and confronted police angrily.\n\nThe Chinese public security minister threatened severe punishment for those found to be responsible for the explosions.However, the authorities did not release any significant information for several days about the chemicals and circumstances, causing public anger to mount during this time.Marking an official change of tack that suggested top-level endorsement, the official People\'s Daily joined in to criticise local officials\' lack of candour and their use of bureaucratic jargon.In addition, the Global Times remarked on the inadequacy of emergency response and the reluctance of high-ranking officials to answer the public\'s questions or address their concerns until four days after the blasts.The People\'s Daily acknowledged that public scepticism of the reported death toll was fuelling rampant rumours; there was disquiet over the emergency assistance provided and the way the aftermath was being handled.Attempting to defuse widespread anger at the lack of official transparency, mouthpieces of the ruling party declared that investigations would be thorough and transparent.Former deputy mayor Yang Dongliang was put under investigation for corruption; mayor Huang Xingguo proclaimed his ""unshirkable responsibility for this accident"".Authorities released information about the ownership of Ruihai, as well as a confession by one beneficial owner for the proxy shareholdings.\n\nMeanwhile, Greenpeace Asia alleged that two Sinochem subsidiaries – Sinochem Tianjin Binhai Logistics Company (with a site) and Tianjin Port Sinochem Hazardous Goods Logistics Company Ltd. – had warehouses in the vicinity in close proximity to a primary and a nursery school, meaning that both were in similar breach of laws.\n\nObservers stated that top officials always attempt to show such disasters as isolated instances, have never accepted political accountability nor addressed the underlying governance issues, and have always heavily censored any criticism of the central government.Willy Lam, professor at CUHK and senior fellow at The Jamestown Foundation, noted the highly unusual period of four days it took for Li Keqiang to make an official visit, suggesting that the lack of a top-ranking visitor to a major disaster

reporters were chased by police, caught, searched, and made to delete photographs from their cameras and computers.\n\nTianjin officials announced that as at the deadline on 3 September 2015, more than 9,000 households out of some 17,000 affected by the explosions had signed agreements to settle their damages claims.It was reported that some had chosen to sell their damaged apartments to private developers, who offered them around 130% of the original purchase price, while others accepted an offer from the local government promising to fix the damaged apartments.The local government offered an additional of ¥20,000 renminbi ($3,100) to those who agreed to settle their claims by the deadline.The New York Times journalists, however, reported that some owners had faced heavy pressure from government officials to settle; similarly, owners who were employees in state-owned enterprises were under threat of dismissal from their bosses for not settling.\n\nOn 10 September 2015 China Daily reported that families of the firefighters killed in the explosions would each receive compensation of 2.3 million yuan (US$360,669), citing a report in Beijing News.It was reported that a monument would be built on the site and that the government planned to compensate residents whose houses were damaged by repurchasing them at 130% of their purchase price.\n\nLess than a month after the disaster, the Tianjin government announced a proposal to turn the site into an ""ecological park"", repurposing the explosion crater as a lake and promising a memorial to the victims to be built on site.The proposal was heavily criticized on Chinese social media, which derided the rushed announcement as an attempt to erase the damage and avoid accountability.The resulting , opened in early

deputy director of the public security bureau\'s fire department told CCTV:\n\nAmmonium nitrate, which is predominantly used as an agricultural fertilizer, oxidizing agent in explosive compositions, and in manufacturing of other chemicals, has been the cause of a number of other fatal industrial explosions.A fire department spokesman confirmed that firefighters had used water in combating the initial fire, which may have led to water being sprayed on calcium carbide, releasing the highly flammable gas acetylene.This would have provided the fuel source for reaction with the oxidizer, ammonium nitrate, thus triggering its detonation more readily.\n\nAt least 700 tonnes of highly toxic sodium cyanide was stored at the site – 70 times the legal limit.Sodium cyanide leakage was reported in the sewer.On 13 August, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, all of which are toxic, were detected within of the origin of the explosion, but the levels conformed with the national standards.Gases were undetectable from the site during initial testing on 14 August.\n\nWhen the first rains after the initial explosions arrived on 18 August, white chemical foam covered the streets.Citizens complained of burning sensations and rashes on sensitive skin regions after coming into contact with rain droplets.However, meteorologists and health experts sought to reassure the public that the rain was not directly harmful to health, whilst the Environment Protection Board advised against exposure to the rain due to traces of cyanide dust reacting with water.\n\nThousands of dead sticklebacks washed up on the banks 6 km from the explosion site on 20 August, fuelling fears of water contamination.Officials downplayed the fears, saying that there were not high levels of cyanide in the river and that the fish likely died due to oxygen depletion in the water.\n\nMore precipitation throughout August in the Binhai New Area brought more complaints of skin irritations and burns from volunteers and journalists.A bright white foam manifested yet again on the streets in a similar manner to before.Deng Xiaowen, director of Tianjin\'s environmental monitoring centre, stated that the foam was ""a normal phenomenon when rain falls, and similar things have occurred before"".\n\nOn Thursday morning, the Chinese leaders ordered officers in the city to make full effort in rescuing the injured, and search for those missing.Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and Li Keqiang, the Premier of the People\'s Republic of China, instructed police to investigate the cause of the incident and punish those responsible for the blast.\n\nTianjin officials, concerned at the potential public response, announced initially that fourteen people had perished in the explosions, but later raised the death toll to forty-four once the scale of the explosions became clear.The South China Morning Post (SCMP) cited a Tianjin police source that officers had been instructed to remove bodies from the scene to deliberately understate the official death toll, which angered the Tianjin government.\n\nThe morning following the explosion, military personnel began to arrive in Tianjin to help with the search and recovery efforts.Extra equipment, such as bulldozers, were brought in to help with the clean-up operation.Over 200 nuclear and biochemical experts, including a team from the International Atomic Energy Agency, began arriving in Tianjin to assess the health risks from the chemicals being released into the atmosphere.Government personnel set up twelve temporary monitoring stations near the blast site with above-normal levels of pollutants being detected.A nearby drainage outlet was also closed, and water quality tested.\n\nFirefighting was suspended on the afternoon of 13 August due to the uncertainty of the content and quantity of hazardous materials being stored on site.A team of over two hundred chemical specialists was deployed to assess the hazardous materials on site and dangers to the environment, and to determine the best way to put out the remaining fires and proceed with search and rescue and clean-up operations.Later that day, rescue personnel were dispatched in an attempt to remove the 700 tonnes of sodium cyanide believed to be stored at the site, with hydrogen peroxide being prepared to neutralise the chemicals.Daily press conferences were organised.A press conference organised by local officials held on 14 August came to an abrupt end when a journalist began asking questions as to why such dangerous chemicals were stockpiled so close to housing estates.\n\nInitially, more than 3,500 area residents were staying in temporary shelters, but the number surpassed 6,000 within three days.The government issued an evacuation order over concerns of further explosions; not all residents complied.\n\nOn 15 August, local authorities ordered the evacuation of residents within a radius of the blast site, prompted by the threat of ""toxic substances"", including sodium cyanide.\n\nThe State Council ordered inspections of all businesses using dangerous chemicals and explosives across the country.\n\nHong Kong media announced that Li Liang, the major shareholder of Ruihai Logistics – owning 55%, was the nephew of former chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and ex-party chief of Tianjin, Li Ruihuan, and that the company may have been named after his brother and Li Liang\'s father; the remaining 45% was owned by Shu Zheng.Reports in state media one week after the explosion were contradictory, holding that Ruihai was owned via proxies by Yu Xuewei, the chairman of Ruihai and a former senior executive at Sinochem, and Dong Shexuan, who served as the company\'s vice-president and who had been arrested by police by the time of the reports.Dong Shexuan is the son of Tianjin port\'s former police chief Dong Peijun, who was a colleague of Wu Changshun, the former chief of the public security bureau of Tianjin.The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), CPC\'s anti-corruption body, charged Wu Changshun with bribery in 2014; Dong Peijun was also under investigation for corruption, but died that year.\n\nAfter the explosions, the CCDI placed Yang Dongliang, Director of the State Administration of Work Safety and China\'s highest work-safety official, under investigation on 18 August 2015.Yang had previously served as Tianjin\'s vice mayor for 11 years.In 2012, Yang Dongliang had issued an order to loosen rules for the handling of hazardous substances, which may have enabled Ruihai to store toxic chemicals such as sodium cyanide.\n\nOn 27 August, Xinhua reported that police had arrested twelve people with suspected connections to the explosions, including Ruihai Logistics\' chairman, vice-chairman, and at least three other managers, with the other seven people unnamed.\n\nOn 5 February 2016, the Chinese government issued the investigation report of the explosions.The report concluded the fire started in a container through auto-ignition of nitrocellulose, due to vaporization of the wetting agent during hot weather.\n\nOn 8 November 2016, various courts in China handed jail sentences to 49 government officials and warehouse executives and staff for their roles in circumventing the safety rules that led to the disaster.Yu Xuewei, the Chairman of Ruihai Logistics, was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve.\n\nImmediately following the blasts, the company website was taken down, fuelling suspicions that an attempt was being made to shield owners with powerful political connections.For several days, local residents seeking compensation for their homes protested in front of the venue of the daily press conference.They were joined by distraught families of missing firefighters and confronted police angrily.\n\nThe Chinese public security minister threatened severe punishment for those found to be responsible for the explosions.However, the authorities did not release any significant information for several days about the chemicals and circumstances, causing public anger to mount during this time.Marking an official change of tack that suggested top-level endorsement, the official People\'s Daily joined in to criticise local officials\' lack of candour and their use of bureaucratic jargon.In addition, the Global Times remarked on the inadequacy of emergency response and the reluctance of high-ranking officials to answer the public\'s questions or address their concerns until four days after the blasts.The People\'s Daily acknowledged that public scepticism of the reported death toll was fuelling rampant rumours; there was disquiet over the emergency assistance provided and the way the aftermath was being handled.Attempting to defuse widespread anger at the lack of official transparency, mouthpieces of the ruling party declared that investigations would be thorough and transparent.Former deputy mayor Yang Dongliang was put under investigation for corruption; mayor Huang Xingguo proclaimed his ""unshirkable responsibility for this accident"".Authorities released information about the ownership of Ruihai, as well as a confession by one beneficial owner for the proxy shareholdings.\n\nMeanwhile, Greenpeace Asia alleged that two Sinochem subsidiaries – Sinochem Tianjin Binhai Logistics Company (with a site) and Tianjin Port Sinochem Hazardous Goods Logistics Company Ltd. – had warehouses in the vicinity in close proximity to a primary and a nursery school, meaning that both were in similar breach of laws.\n\nObservers stated that top officials always attempt to show such disasters as isolated instances, have never accepted political accountability nor addressed the underlying governance issues, and have always heavily censored any criticism of the central government.Willy Lam, professor at CUHK and senior fellow at The Jamestown Foundation, noted the highly unusual period of four days it took for Li Keqiang to make an official visit, suggesting that the lack of a top-ranking visitor to a major disaster site within forty-eight hours despite the proximity to Beijing reflected ""division among the leadership on who should be the fall guy.""\n\nInitially, Tianjin authorities banned editors and reporters from sharing information about the disaster on Weibo and WeChat, and websites were ordered to follow state media.\n\nThe Tianjin internet police warned social media users to use only official casualty figures.\n\nTianjin Television had reported the explosion on their early morning news at 7:00 am, but citizens complained that the station had not reported live nor updated on the event, instead showing soap operas eight hours later.\n\nA great deal of specific information on the event, including the majority of early stage video, was first released over social media sites, and in particular microblogging platforms like Weibo.Major media has drawn heavily from social media sources, greatly widening the audience.The Economist noted, ""Social media fills in the blanks left by official narratives of the Tianjin disaster.The most remarkable feature of the aftermath of the explosions in Tianjin, in Northern China, has been the extraordinary contrast between the official reaction to the crisis, which has been profoundly flawed, and the online reaction, which has entirely dominated the agenda.""\n\nProfessional and social media reports were censored by Chinese authorities.The censorship rate increased tenfold on the social media site Weibo, with users reporting the deletion of their posts regarding the blasts, with ""Tianjin"" and ""explosion"" being the most censored words.An article by Caijing, which carried an interview with a firefighter who said that no-one on the front line had been informed of the dangerous chemicals on site that would react exothermically when mixed with water, was deleted after it had been reposted 10,000 times; many other posts mentioning the existence of deadly sodium cyanide were also expunged.\n\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China banned all journalists from posting to social media, and insisted on strict adherence to Xinhua\'s editorial line.On 15 August, it announced that it had shut down 18 websites and suspended 32 more for spreading false information.More than 360 Weibo and public WeChat accounts which had allegedly been spreading such false rumors have been ""punished according to laws"".Of these accounts, over 160 were shut down permanently.\n\nPress freedom organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF) accused the Chinese state media of playing up the heroic efforts of rescue workers and firefighters while downplaying the causes of the explosions and the number of casualties.RSF said that censorship by the Chinese authorities showed ""a flagrant indifference to the public\'s legitimate concerns"".\n\nA CNN correspondent was interrupted by bystanders and forced to leave during a live report outside TEDA Hospital.A journalist from the Beijing News reported that he and two other reporters were chased by police, caught, searched, and made to delete photographs from their cameras and computers.\n\nTianjin officials announced that as at the deadline on 3 September 2015, more than 9,000 households out of some 17,000 affected by the explosions had signed agreements to settle their damages claims.It was reported that some had chosen to sell their damaged apartments to private developers, who offered them around 130% of the original purchase price, while others accepted an offer from the local government promising to fix the damaged apartments.The local government offered an additional of ¥20,000 renminbi ($3,100) to those who agreed to settle their claims by the deadline.The New York Times journalists, however, reported that some owners had faced heavy pressure from government officials to settle; similarly, owners who were employees in state-owned enterprises were under threat of dismissal from their bosses for not settling.\n\nOn 10 September 2015 China Daily reported that families of the firefighters killed in the explosions would each receive compensation of 2.3 million yuan (US$360,669), citing a report in Beijing News.It was reported that a monument would be built on the site and that the government planned to compensate residents whose houses were damaged by repurchasing them at 130% of their purchase price.\n\nLess than a month after the disaster, the Tianjin government announced a proposal to turn the site into an ""ecological park"", repurposing the explosion crater as a lake and promising a memorial to the victims to be built on site.The proposal was heavily criticized on Chinese social media, which derided the rushed announcement as an attempt to erase the damage and avoid accountability.The resulting , opened in early 2017, was further criticized for being an extremely rushed and sloppy design.Both the crater lake and the proposed memorial were ultimately discarded; as a result, there is currently no permanent memorial to the disaster.\n\n2023 Yinchuan gas explosion 2020 Beirut explosion 2019 Xiangshui chemical plant explosion 2015 Dongying explosion 2014 Shanghai stampede 2014 Kunshan explosion 1988 PEPCON

69,"{'Wiki_Title': '2015 Tianjin explosions', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'On 12 August 2015, a series of explosions at the Port of Tianjin in Tianjin, Northern China, killed 173 people, according to official reports, and injured hundreds of others.The explosions occurred at a container storage station in the Binhai New Area of Tianjin, China.The first two explosions occurred 33 seconds apart.The second explosion was much larger and involved the detonation of about 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate (approx.256 tonnes TNT equivalent).Fires caused by the initial explosions continued to burn uncontrolled throughout the weekend, resulting in eight additional explosions on 15 August.\n\nThe cause of the explosions was not immediately known, but an investigation concluded in February 2016 that an overheated container of dry nitrocellulose was the cause of the initial explosion.The official casualty report was 173 deaths, eight missing, and 798 non-fatal injuries.Of the 173 fatalities, 104 were firefighters.\n\nTianjin Dongjiang Port Ruihai International Logistics (), or Ruihai Logistics (), is a privately held logistics company established in 2011.It handled hazardous chemicals within the Port of Tianjin, such as flammable and corrosive substances, oxidizing agents, and toxic chemicals.The company, which employed 70, was designated by the Tianjin Maritime Safety Administration () as an approved agent for handling these hazardous chemicals at the port, and its operating license was renewed two months prior to the explosions.Its site, roughly the size of two city blocks, contained multiple warehouses for hazardous goods, a fire pump and a fire pond.\n\nThe warehouse building, owned by Ruihai Logistics, is recorded in a 2014 government document as being a hazardous chemical storage facility for calcium carbide, sodium nitrate, and potassium nitrate.Safety regulations requiring that public buildings and facilities should be at least 1 kilometre away were not followed, and local inhabitants were unaware of the danger.The authorities stated that poor record keeping, damage to the office facilities and ""major discrepancies"" with customs meant that they were unable to identify the substances stored.State media revealed that Ruihai had only received its authorisation to handle dangerous chemicals less than two months earlier, meaning that it had been operating illegally from October 2014, when its temporary license had expired, to June 2015.\n\nThe first reports of a fire at a warehouse in the Binhai New Area began coming in at around 22:50 local time (14:50 UTC) on 12 August.The first responders were unable to keep the fire from spreading.Firefighters who first arrived on the scene proceeded to douse the fire with water as they were unaware that dangerous chemicals were stored on the site, thereby setting in motion a series of more violent chemical reactions.\n\nAt around 23:30 (15:30 UTC), the first explosion occurred and registered as a magnitude 2.3 earthquake, generating seismic shock-waves energetically equivalent to 2.9 tonnes of TNT.After 30 seconds, a second violent explosion occurred, causing most of the damage and injuries with shock-waves felt many kilometres away.The second explosion registered as a magnitude 2.9 earthquake and generated seismic shock-waves with energy equivalent to 21.9 tonnes of TNT.The resulting fireballs reached hundreds of meters in height.Around 23:40 (15:40 UTC) on 15 August, a series of eight smaller explosions occurred in the port as fire from the original blasts continued to spread.The total energy release was equivalent to 28 tonnes of TNT, or 100GJ.\n\nThe explosion was large enough to be photographed by Himawari, a geostationary meteorological satellite operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).Chinese scientists subsequently estimated that the second more powerful explosion involved the detonation of about 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, based on crater size and lethality radius (336 tons TNT equivalent, based on relative effectiveness factor of 0.42).\n\nOne month after the explosion, official reports listed 173 deaths and 797 injuries.Media reported the area to be densely populated, with around 5,600 families living within radius of the plant, the closest being only away.Neither the developers nor the buyers were aware of the latent dangers of the activities at the nearby site; developers claimed also to be victims.According to the Tianjin government, more than 700 people were injured by the explosion, many with extensive injuries, mostly from burns and explosive blast injuries.Over a thousand firefighters were on scene, and 95 were killed.One surviving firefighter from his team, a 19-year-old named ZhouTi (), was found on the morning of 14 August.The death toll, which also included 11 police officers, was the worst in a single incident for Chinese front line responders since the founding of the People\'s Republic of China in 1949.\n\nPhotographs and videos showed extensive destruction in and around the warehouse compound, with an enormous crater at the blast site.The buildings of seven more surrounding logistics companies were destroyed, and large quantities of intermodal container stacks were toppled and thrown by the forces of the explosions.More than eight thousand new cars from Hyundai, Kia, Volkswagen, Renault, and Toyota, parked in lots located near the blast site, were largely burned as a result of the initial explosions.Multiple buildings surrounding the blast site were declared ""structurally unsafe"".In total, 304 buildings, 12,428 cars, and 7,533 intermodal containers were damaged.Beyond insurance, the cost to businesses of the break in the supply chain caused by the explosions was estimated at $9 billion, making it the third most expensive supply chain disruption of 2015.\n\nApartment blocks from the site sustained shattered glass, loss of roof tiles and damage to ceilings – with 17,000 units being affected.Nearby Donghai Road Station suffered severe damage as a result of the explosions and was closed until 2016, as was the rest of Line 9 of the Tianjin Metro beginning on 13 August.A Japanese department store four kilometres away reported damage to walls and ceilings.The explosions also affected the National Supercomputing Center of Tianjin several kilometres away, knocking out windows and causing some internal ceilings to collapse; the center\'s supercomputer Tianhe-1A itself was not damaged.\n\nIt is not known what chemicals were being stored at the site.In addition to vast quantities of sodium cyanide and calcium carbide, paperwork was discovered showing that 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate and 500 tonnes of potassium nitrate were at the blast site.On 17 August, the deputy director of the public security bureau\'s fire department told CCTV:\n\nAmmonium nitrate, which is predominantly used as an agricultural fertilizer, oxidizing agent in explosive compositions, and in manufacturing of other chemicals, has been the cause of a number of other fatal industrial explosions.A fire department spokesman confirmed that firefighters had used water in combating the initial fire, which may have led to water being sprayed on calcium carbide, releasing the highly flammable gas acetylene.This would have provided the fuel source for reaction with the oxidizer, ammonium nitrate, thus triggering its detonation more readily.\n\nAt least 700 tonnes of highly toxic sodium cyanide was stored at the site – 70 times the legal limit.Sodium cyanide leakage was reported in the sewer.On 13 August, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, all of which are toxic, were detected within of the origin of the explosion, but the levels conformed with the national standards.Gases were undetectable from the site during initial testing on 14 August.\n\nWhen the first rains after the initial explosions arrived on 18 August, white chemical foam covered the streets.Citizens complained of burning sensations and rashes on sensitive skin regions after coming into contact with rain droplets.However, meteorologists and health experts sought to reassure the

set up twelve temporary monitoring stations near the blast site with above-normal levels of pollutants being detected.A nearby drainage outlet was also closed, and water quality tested.\n\nFirefighting was suspended on the afternoon of 13 August due to the uncertainty of the content and quantity of hazardous materials being stored on site.A team of over two hundred chemical specialists was deployed to assess the hazardous materials on site and dangers to the environment, and to determine the best way to put out the remaining fires and proceed with search and rescue and clean-up operations.Later that day, rescue personnel were dispatched in an attempt to remove the 700 tonnes of sodium cyanide believed to be stored at the site, with hydrogen peroxide being prepared to neutralise the chemicals.Daily press conferences were organised.A press conference organised by local officials held on 14 August came to an abrupt end when a journalist began asking questions as to why such dangerous chemicals were stockpiled so close to housing estates.\n\nInitially, more than 3,500 area residents were staying in temporary shelters, but the number surpassed 6,000 within three days.The government issued an evacuation order over concerns of further explosions; not all residents complied.\n\nOn 15 August, local authorities ordered the evacuation of residents within a radius of the blast site, prompted by the threat of ""toxic substances"", including sodium cyanide.\n\nThe State Council ordered inspections of all businesses using dangerous chemicals and explosives across the country.\n\nHong Kong media announced that Li Liang, the major shareholder of Ruihai Logistics – owning 55%, was the nephew of former chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and ex-party chief of Tianjin, Li Ruihuan, and that the company may have been named after his brother and Li Liang\'s father; the remaining 45% was owned by Shu Zheng.Reports in state media one week after the

former chief of the public security bureau of Tianjin.The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), CPC\'s anti-corruption body, charged Wu Changshun with bribery in 2014; Dong Peijun was also under investigation for corruption, but died that year.\n\nAfter the explosions, the CCDI placed Yang Dongliang, Director of the State Administration of Work Safety and China\'s highest work-safety official, under investigation on 18 August 2015.Yang had previously served as Tianjin\'s vice mayor for 11 years.In 2012, Yang Dongliang had issued an order to loosen rules for the handling of hazardous substances, which may have enabled Ruihai to store toxic chemicals such as sodium cyanide.\n\nOn 27 August, Xinhua reported that police had arrested twelve people with suspected

reporters were chased by police, caught, searched, and made to delete photographs from their cameras and computers.\n\nTianjin officials announced that as at the deadline on 3 September 2015, more than 9,000 households out of some 17,000 affected by the explosions had signed agreements to settle their damages claims.It was reported that some had chosen to sell their damaged apartments to private developers, who offered them around 130% of the original purchase price, while others accepted an offer from the local government promising to fix the damaged apartments.The local government offered an additional of ¥20,000 renminbi ($3,100) to those who agreed to settle their claims by the deadline.The New York Times journalists, however, reported that some owners had faced heavy pressure from government officials to settle; similarly, owners who were employees in state-owned enterprises were under threat of dismissal from their bosses for not settling.\n\nOn 10 September 2015 China Daily reported that families of the firefighters killed in the explosions would each receive compensation of 2.3 million yuan (US$360,669), citing a report in Beijing News.It was reported that a monument would be built on the site and that the government planned to compensate residents whose houses were damaged by repurchasing them at 130% of their purchase price.\n\nLess than a month after

2017, was further criticized for being an extremely rushed and sloppy design.Both the crater lake and the proposed memorial were ultimately discarded; as a result, there is currently no permanent memorial to the disaster.\n\n2023 Yinchuan gas explosion 2020 Beirut explosion 2019 Xiangshui chemical plant explosion 2015 Dongying explosion 2014 Shanghai stampede 2014 Kunshan explosion 1988 PEPCON

70,"{'Wiki_Title': '2015 Tianjin explosions', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'On 12 August 2015, a series of explosions at the Port of Tianjin in Tianjin, Northern China, killed 173 people, according to official reports, and injured hundreds of others.The explosions occurred at a container storage station in the Binhai New Area of Tianjin, China.The first two explosions occurred 33 seconds apart.The second explosion was much larger and involved the detonation of about 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate (approx.256 tonnes TNT equivalent).Fires caused by the initial explosions continued to burn uncontrolled throughout the weekend, resulting in eight additional explosions on 15 August.\n\nThe cause of the explosions was not immediately known, but an investigation concluded in February 2016 that an overheated container of dry nitrocellulose was the cause of the initial explosion.The official casualty report was 173 deaths, eight missing, and 798 non-fatal injuries.Of the 173 fatalities, 104 were firefighters.\n\nTianjin Dongjiang Port Ruihai International Logistics (), or Ruihai Logistics (), is a privately held logistics company established in 2011.It handled hazardous chemicals within the Port of Tianjin, such as flammable and corrosive substances, oxidizing agents, and toxic chemicals.The company, which employed 70, was designated by the Tianjin Maritime Safety Administration () as an approved agent for handling these hazardous chemicals at the port, and its operating license was renewed two months prior to the explosions.Its site, roughly the size of two city blocks, contained multiple warehouses for hazardous goods, a fire pump and a fire pond.\n\nThe warehouse building, owned by Ruihai Logistics, is recorded in a 2014 government document as being a hazardous chemical storage facility for calcium carbide, sodium nitrate, and potassium nitrate.Safety regulations requiring that public buildings and facilities should be at least 1 kilometre away were not followed, and local inhabitants were unaware of the danger.The authorities stated that poor record keeping, damage to the office facilities and ""major discrepancies"" with customs meant that they were unable to identify the substances stored.State media revealed that Ruihai had only received its authorisation to handle dangerous chemicals less than two months earlier, meaning that it had been operating illegally from October 2014, when its temporary license had expired, to June 2015.\n\nThe first reports of a fire at a warehouse in the Binhai New Area began coming in at around 22:50 local time (14:50 UTC) on 12 August.The first responders were unable to keep the fire from spreading.Firefighters who first arrived on the scene proceeded to douse the fire with water as they were unaware that dangerous chemicals were stored on the site, thereby setting in motion a series of more violent chemical reactions.\n\nAt around 23:30 (15:30 UTC), the first explosion occurred and registered as a magnitude 2.3 earthquake, generating seismic shock-waves energetically equivalent to 2.9 tonnes of TNT.After 30 seconds, a second violent explosion occurred, causing most of the damage and injuries with shock-waves felt many kilometres away.The second explosion registered as a magnitude 2.9 earthquake and generated seismic shock-waves with energy equivalent to 21.9 tonnes of TNT.The resulting fireballs reached hundreds of meters in height.Around 23:40 (15:40 UTC) on 15 August, a series of eight smaller explosions occurred in the port as fire from the original blasts continued to spread.The total energy release was equivalent to 28 tonnes of TNT, or 100GJ.\n\nThe explosion was large enough to be photographed by Himawari, a geostationary meteorological satellite operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).Chinese scientists subsequently estimated that the second more powerful explosion involved the detonation of about 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, based on crater size and lethality radius (336 tons TNT equivalent, based on relative effectiveness factor of 0.42).\n\nOne month after the explosion, official reports listed 173 deaths and 797 injuries.Media reported the area to be densely populated, with around 5,600 families living within radius of the plant, the closest being only away.Neither the developers nor the buyers were aware of the latent dangers of the activities at the nearby site; developers claimed also to be victims.According to the Tianjin government, more than 700 people were injured by the explosion, many with extensive injuries, mostly from burns and explosive blast injuries.Over a thousand firefighters were on scene, and 95 were killed.One surviving firefighter from his team, a 19-year-old named ZhouTi (), was found on the morning of 14 August.The death toll, which also included 11 police officers, was the worst in a single incident for Chinese front line responders since the founding of the People\'s Republic of China in 1949.\n\nPhotographs and videos showed extensive destruction in and around the warehouse compound, with an enormous crater at the blast site.The buildings of seven more surrounding logistics companies were destroyed, and large quantities of intermodal container stacks were toppled and thrown by the forces of the explosions.More than eight thousand new cars from Hyundai, Kia, Volkswagen, Renault, and Toyota, parked in lots located near the blast site, were largely burned as a result of the initial explosions.Multiple buildings surrounding the blast site were declared ""structurally unsafe"".In total, 304 buildings, 12,428 cars, and 7,533 intermodal containers were damaged.Beyond insurance, the cost to businesses of the break in the supply chain caused by the explosions was estimated at $9 billion, making it the third most expensive supply chain disruption of 2015.\n\nApartment blocks from the site sustained shattered glass, loss of roof tiles and damage to ceilings – with 17,000 units being affected.Nearby Donghai Road Station suffered severe damage as a result of the explosions and was closed until 2016, as was the rest of Line 9 of the Tianjin Metro beginning on 13 August.A Japanese department store four kilometres away reported damage to walls and ceilings.The explosions also affected the National Supercomputing Center of Tianjin several kilometres away, knocking out windows and causing some internal ceilings to collapse; the center\'s supercomputer Tianhe-1A itself was not damaged.\n\nIt is not known what chemicals were being stored at the site.In addition to vast quantities of sodium cyanide and calcium carbide, paperwork was discovered showing that 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate and 500 tonnes of potassium nitrate were at the blast site.On 17 August, the deputy director of the public security bureau\'s fire department told CCTV:\n\nAmmonium nitrate, which is predominantly used as an agricultural fertilizer, oxidizing agent in explosive compositions, and in manufacturing of other chemicals, has been the cause of a number of other fatal industrial explosions.A fire department spokesman confirmed that firefighters had used water in combating the initial fire, which may have led to water being sprayed on calcium carbide, releasing the highly flammable gas acetylene.This would have provided the fuel source for reaction with the oxidizer, ammonium nitrate, thus triggering its detonation more readily.\n\nAt least 700 tonnes of highly toxic sodium cyanide was stored at the site – 70 times the legal limit.Sodium cyanide leakage was reported in the sewer.On 13 August, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, all of which are toxic, were detected within of the origin of the explosion, but the levels conformed with the national standards.Gases were undetectable from the site during initial testing on 14 August.\n\nWhen the first rains after the initial explosions arrived on 18 August, white chemical foam covered the streets.Citizens complained of burning sensations and rashes on sensitive skin regions after coming into contact with rain droplets.However, meteorologists and health experts sought to reassure the public that the rain was not directly harmful to health, whilst the Environment Protection Board advised against exposure to the rain due to traces of cyanide dust reacting with water.\n\nThousands of dead sticklebacks washed up on the banks 6 km from the explosion site on 20 August, fuelling fears of water contamination.Officials downplayed the fears, saying that there were not high levels of cyanide in the river and that the fish likely died due to oxygen depletion in the water.\n\nMore precipitation throughout August in the Binhai New Area brought more complaints of skin irritations and burns from volunteers and journalists.A bright white foam manifested yet again on the streets in a similar manner to before.Deng Xiaowen, director of Tianjin\'s environmental monitoring centre, stated that the foam was ""a normal phenomenon when rain falls, and similar things have occurred before"".\n\nOn Thursday morning, the Chinese leaders ordered officers in the city to make full effort in rescuing the injured, and search for those missing.Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and Li Keqiang, the Premier of the People\'s Republic of China, instructed police to investigate the cause of the incident and punish those responsible for the blast.\n\nTianjin officials, concerned at the potential public response, announced initially that fourteen people had perished in the explosions, but later raised the death toll to forty-four once the scale of the explosions became clear.The South China Morning Post (SCMP) cited a Tianjin police source that officers had been instructed to remove bodies from the scene to deliberately understate the official death toll, which angered the Tianjin government.\n\nThe morning following the explosion, military personnel began to arrive in Tianjin to help with the search and recovery efforts.Extra equipment, such as bulldozers, were brought in to help with the clean-up operation.Over 200 nuclear and biochemical experts, including a team from the International Atomic Energy Agency, began arriving in Tianjin to assess the health risks from the chemicals being released into the atmosphere.Government personnel set up twelve temporary monitoring stations near the blast site with above-normal levels of pollutants being detected.A nearby drainage outlet was also closed, and water quality tested.\n\nFirefighting was suspended on the afternoon of 13 August due to the uncertainty of the content and quantity of hazardous materials being stored on site.A team of over two hundred chemical specialists was deployed to assess the hazardous materials on site and dangers to the environment, and to determine the best way to put out the remaining fires and proceed with search and rescue and clean-up operations.Later that day, rescue personnel were dispatched in an attempt to remove the 700 tonnes of sodium cyanide believed to be stored at the site, with hydrogen peroxide being prepared to neutralise the chemicals.Daily press conferences were organised.A press conference organised by local officials held on 14 August came to an abrupt end when a journalist began asking questions as to why such dangerous chemicals were stockpiled so close to housing estates.\n\nInitially, more than 3,500 area residents were staying in temporary shelters, but the number surpassed 6,000 within three days.The government issued an evacuation order over concerns of further explosions; not all residents complied.\n\nOn 15 August, local authorities ordered the evacuation of residents within a radius of the blast site, prompted by the threat of ""toxic substances"", including sodium cyanide.\n\nThe State Council ordered inspections of all businesses using dangerous chemicals and explosives across the country.\n\nHong Kong media announced that Li Liang, the major shareholder of Ruihai Logistics – owning 55%, was the nephew of former chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and ex-party chief of Tianjin, Li Ruihuan, and that the company may have been named after his brother and Li Liang\'s father; the remaining 45% was owned by Shu Zheng.Reports in state media one week after the explosion were contradictory, holding that Ruihai was owned via proxies by Yu Xuewei, the chairman of Ruihai and a former senior executive at Sinochem, and Dong Shexuan, who served as the company\'s vice-president and who had been arrested by police by the time of the reports.Dong Shexuan is the son of Tianjin port\'s former police chief Dong Peijun, who was a colleague of Wu Changshun, the former chief of the public security bureau of Tianjin.The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), CPC\'s anti-corruption body, charged Wu Changshun with bribery in 2014; Dong Peijun was also under investigation for corruption, but died that year.\n\nAfter the explosions, the CCDI placed Yang Dongliang, Director of the State Administration of Work Safety and China\'s highest work-safety official, under investigation on 18 August 2015.Yang had previously served as Tianjin\'s vice mayor for 11 years.In 2012, Yang Dongliang had issued an order to loosen rules for the handling of hazardous substances, which may have enabled Ruihai to store toxic chemicals such as sodium cyanide.\n\nOn 27 August, Xinhua reported that police had arrested twelve people with suspected connections to the explosions, including Ruihai Logistics\' chairman, vice-chairman, and at least three other managers, with the other seven people unnamed.\n\nOn 5 February 2016, the Chinese government issued the investigation report of the explosions.The report concluded the fire started in a container through auto-ignition of nitrocellulose, due to vaporization of the wetting agent during hot weather.\n\nOn 8 November 2016, various courts in China handed jail sentences to 49 government officials and warehouse executives and staff for their roles in circumventing the safety rules that led to the disaster.Yu Xuewei, the Chairman of Ruihai Logistics, was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve.\n\nImmediately following the blasts, the company website was taken down, fuelling suspicions that an attempt was being made to shield owners with powerful political connections.For several days, local residents seeking compensation for their homes protested in front of the venue of the daily press conference.They were joined by distraught families of missing firefighters and confronted police angrily.\n\nThe Chinese public security minister threatened severe punishment for those found to be responsible for the explosions.However, the authorities did not release any significant information for several days about the chemicals and circumstances, causing public anger to mount during this time.Marking an official change of tack that suggested top-level endorsement, the official People\'s Daily joined in to criticise local officials\' lack of candour and their use of bureaucratic jargon.In addition, the Global Times remarked on the inadequacy of emergency response and the reluctance of high-ranking officials to answer the public\'s questions or address their concerns until four days after the blasts.The People\'s Daily acknowledged that public scepticism of the reported death toll was fuelling rampant rumours; there was disquiet over the emergency assistance provided and the way the aftermath was being handled.Attempting to defuse widespread anger at the lack of official transparency, mouthpieces of the ruling party declared that investigations would be thorough and transparent.Former deputy mayor Yang Dongliang was put under investigation for corruption; mayor Huang Xingguo proclaimed his ""unshirkable responsibility for this accident"".Authorities released information about the ownership of Ruihai, as well as a confession by one beneficial owner for the proxy shareholdings.\n\nMeanwhile, Greenpeace Asia alleged that two Sinochem subsidiaries – Sinochem Tianjin Binhai Logistics Company (with a site) and Tianjin Port Sinochem Hazardous Goods Logistics Company Ltd. – had warehouses in the vicinity in close proximity to a primary and a nursery school, meaning that both were in similar breach of laws.\n\nObservers stated that top officials always attempt to show such disasters as isolated instances, have never accepted political accountability nor addressed the underlying governance issues, and have always heavily censored any criticism of the central government.Willy Lam, professor at CUHK and senior fellow at The Jamestown Foundation, noted the highly unusual period of four days it took for Li Keqiang to make an official visit, suggesting that the lack of a top-ranking visitor to a major disaster site within forty-eight hours despite the proximity to Beijing reflected ""division among the leadership on who should be the fall guy.""\n\nInitially, Tianjin authorities banned editors and reporters from sharing information about the disaster on Weibo and WeChat, and websites were ordered to follow state media.\n\nThe Tianjin internet police warned social media users to use only official casualty figures.\n\nTianjin Television had reported the explosion on their early morning news at 7:00 am, but citizens complained that the station had not reported live nor updated on the event, instead showing soap operas eight hours later.\n\nA great deal of specific information on the event, including the majority of early stage video, was first released over social media sites, and in particular microblogging platforms like Weibo.Major media has drawn heavily from social media sources, greatly widening the audience.The Economist noted, ""Social media fills in the blanks left by official narratives of the Tianjin disaster.The most remarkable feature of the aftermath of the explosions in Tianjin, in Northern China, has been the extraordinary contrast between the official reaction to the crisis, which has been profoundly flawed, and the online reaction, which has entirely dominated the agenda.""\n\nProfessional and social media reports were censored by Chinese authorities.The censorship rate increased tenfold on the social media site Weibo, with users reporting the deletion of their posts regarding the blasts, with ""Tianjin"" and ""explosion"" being the most censored words.An article by Caijing, which carried an interview with a firefighter who said that no-one on the front line had been informed of the dangerous chemicals on site that would react exothermically when mixed with water, was deleted after it had been reposted 10,000 times; many other posts mentioning the existence of deadly sodium cyanide were also expunged.\n\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China banned all journalists from posting to social media, and insisted on strict adherence to Xinhua\'s editorial line.On 15 August, it announced that it had shut down 18 websites and suspended 32 more for spreading false information.More than 360 Weibo and public WeChat accounts which had allegedly been spreading such false rumors have been ""punished according to laws"".Of these accounts, over 160 were shut down permanently.\n\nPress freedom organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF) accused the Chinese state media of playing up the heroic efforts of rescue workers and firefighters while downplaying the causes of the explosions and the number of casualties.RSF said that censorship by the Chinese authorities showed ""a flagrant indifference to the public\'s legitimate concerns"".\n\nA CNN correspondent was interrupted by bystanders and forced to leave during a live report outside TEDA Hospital.A journalist from the Beijing News reported that he and two other reporters were chased by police, caught, searched, and made to delete photographs from their cameras and computers.\n\nTianjin officials announced that as at the deadline on 3 September 2015, more than 9,000 households out of some 17,000 affected by the explosions had signed agreements to settle their damages claims.It was reported that some had chosen to sell their damaged apartments to private developers, who offered them around 130% of the original purchase price, while others accepted an offer from the local government promising to fix the damaged apartments.The local government offered an additional of ¥20,000 renminbi ($3,100) to those who agreed to settle their claims by the deadline.The New York Times journalists, however, reported that some owners had faced heavy pressure from government officials to settle; similarly, owners who were employees in state-owned enterprises were under threat of dismissal from their bosses for not settling.\n\nOn 10 September 2015 China Daily reported that families of the firefighters killed in the explosions would each receive compensation of 2.3 million yuan (US$360,669), citing a report in Beijing News.It was reported that a monument would be built on the site and that the government planned to compensate residents whose houses were damaged by repurchasing them at 130% of their purchase price.\n\nLess than a month after the disaster, the Tianjin government announced a proposal to turn the site into an ""ecological park"", repurposing the explosion crater as a lake and promising a memorial to the victims to be built on site.The proposal was heavily criticized on Chinese social media, which derided the rushed announcement as an attempt to erase the damage and avoid accountability.The resulting , opened in early 2017, was further criticized for being an extremely rushed and sloppy design.Both the crater lake and the proposed memorial were ultimately discarded; as a result, there is currently no permanent memorial to the disaster.\n\n2023 Yinchuan gas explosion 2020 Beirut explosion 2019 Xiangshui chemical plant explosion 2015 Dongying explosion 2014 Shanghai stampede 2014 Kunshan explosion 1988 PEPCON

billion, making it the third most expensive supply chain disruption of 2015.\n\nApartment blocks from the site sustained shattered glass, loss of roof tiles and damage to ceilings – with 17,000 units being affected.Nearby Donghai Road Station suffered severe damage as a result of the explosions and was closed until 2016, as was the rest of Line 9 of the Tianjin Metro beginning on 13 August.A

chief of Tianjin, Li Ruihuan, and that the company may have been named after his brother and Li Liang\'s father; the remaining 45% was owned by Shu Zheng.Reports in state media one week after the explosion were contradictory, holding that Ruihai was owned via proxies by Yu Xuewei, the chairman of Ruihai and a former senior executive at Sinochem, and Dong Shexuan, who served as the company\'s vice-president and who had been arrested by police by the time of the reports.Dong Shexuan is the son of Tianjin port\'s former police chief Dong Peijun, who was a colleague of Wu Changshun, the former chief of the public security bureau of Tianjin.The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), CPC\'s anti-corruption body, charged Wu Changshun with bribery in 2014; Dong Peijun was also under investigation for corruption, but died that year.\n\nAfter the explosions, the CCDI placed Yang Dongliang, Director of the State Administration of Work Safety and China\'s highest work-safety official, under investigation on 18 August 2015.Yang had previously served as Tianjin\'s vice mayor for 11 years.In 2012, Yang Dongliang had issued an order to loosen rules for the handling of hazardous substances, which may have enabled Ruihai to store toxic chemicals such as sodium cyanide.\n\nOn 27 August, Xinhua reported that police had arrested twelve people with suspected connections to the explosions, including Ruihai Logistics\' chairman, vice-chairman, and at least three other managers, with the other seven people unnamed.\n\nOn 5 February 2016, the Chinese government issued the investigation report of the explosions.The report concluded the fire started in a container through auto-ignition of nitrocellulose, due to vaporization of the wetting agent during hot weather.\n\nOn 8 November 2016, various courts in China handed jail sentences to 49 government officials and warehouse executives and staff for their roles in circumventing the safety rules that led to the disaster.Yu Xuewei, the Chairman of Ruihai Logistics, was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve.\n\nImmediately following the blasts, the company website was taken down, fuelling suspicions that an attempt was being made to shield owners with powerful political connections.For several days, local residents seeking compensation for their homes protested in front of the venue of the daily press conference.They were joined by distraught families of missing firefighters and confronted police angrily.\n\nThe Chinese public security minister threatened severe punishment for those found to be responsible for the explosions.However, the authorities did not release any significant information for several days about the chemicals and circumstances, causing public anger to mount during this time.Marking an official change of tack that suggested top-level endorsement, the official People\'s Daily joined in to criticise local officials\' lack of candour and their use of bureaucratic jargon.In addition, the Global Times remarked on the inadequacy of emergency response and the reluctance of high-ranking officials to answer the public\'s questions or address their concerns until four days after the blasts.The People\'s Daily acknowledged that public scepticism of the reported death toll was fuelling rampant rumours; there was disquiet over the emergency assistance provided and the way the aftermath was being handled.Attempting to defuse widespread anger at the lack of official transparency, mouthpieces of the ruling party declared that investigations would be thorough and transparent.Former deputy mayor Yang Dongliang was put under investigation for corruption; mayor Huang Xingguo proclaimed his ""unshirkable responsibility for this accident"".Authorities released information about the ownership of Ruihai, as well as a confession by one beneficial owner for the proxy shareholdings.\n\nMeanwhile, Greenpeace Asia alleged that two Sinochem subsidiaries – Sinochem Tianjin Binhai Logistics Company (with a site) and Tianjin Port Sinochem Hazardous Goods Logistics Company Ltd. – had warehouses in the vicinity in close proximity to a primary and a nursery school, meaning that both were in similar breach of laws.\n\nObservers stated that top officials always attempt to show such disasters as isolated instances, have never accepted political accountability nor addressed the underlying governance issues, and have always heavily censored any criticism of the central government.Willy Lam, professor at CUHK and senior fellow at The Jamestown Foundation, noted the highly unusual period of four days it took for Li Keqiang to make an official visit, suggesting that the lack of a top-ranking visitor to a major disaster site within forty-eight hours despite the proximity to Beijing reflected ""division among the leadership on who should be the fall guy.""\n\nInitially, Tianjin authorities banned editors and reporters from sharing information about the disaster on Weibo and WeChat, and websites were ordered to follow state media.\n\nThe Tianjin internet police warned social media users to use only official casualty figures.\n\nTianjin Television had reported the explosion on their early morning news at 7:00 am, but citizens complained that the station had not reported live nor updated on the event, instead showing soap operas eight hours later.\n\nA great deal of specific information on the event, including the majority of early stage video, was first released over social media sites, and in particular microblogging platforms like Weibo.Major media has drawn heavily from social media sources, greatly widening the audience.The Economist noted, ""Social media fills in the blanks left by official narratives of the Tianjin disaster.The most remarkable feature of the aftermath of the explosions in Tianjin, in Northern China, has been the extraordinary contrast between the official reaction to the crisis, which has been profoundly flawed, and the online reaction, which has entirely dominated the agenda.""\n\nProfessional and social media reports were censored by Chinese authorities.The censorship rate increased tenfold on the social media site Weibo, with users reporting the deletion of their posts regarding the blasts, with ""Tianjin"" and ""explosion"" being the most censored words.An article by Caijing, which carried an interview with a firefighter who said that no-one on the front line had been informed of the dangerous chemicals on site that would react exothermically when mixed with water, was deleted after it had been reposted 10,000 times; many other posts mentioning the existence of deadly sodium cyanide were also expunged.\n\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China banned all journalists from posting to social media, and insisted on strict adherence to Xinhua\'s editorial line.On 15 August, it announced that it had shut down 18 websites and suspended 32 more for spreading false information.More than 360 Weibo and public WeChat accounts which had allegedly been spreading such false rumors have been ""punished according to laws"".Of these accounts, over 160 were shut down permanently.\n\nPress freedom organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF) accused the Chinese state media of playing up the heroic efforts of rescue workers and firefighters while downplaying the causes of the explosions and the number of casualties.RSF said that censorship by the Chinese authorities showed ""a flagrant indifference to the public\'s legitimate concerns"".\n\nA CNN correspondent was interrupted by bystanders and forced to leave during a live report outside TEDA Hospital.A journalist from the Beijing News reported that he and two other reporters were chased by police, caught, searched, and made to delete photographs from their cameras and computers.\n\nTianjin officials announced that as at the deadline on 3 September 2015, more than 9,000 households out of some 17,000 affected by the explosions had signed agreements to settle their damages claims.It was reported that some had chosen to sell their damaged apartments to private developers, who offered them around 130% of the original purchase price, while others accepted an offer from the local government promising to fix the damaged apartments.The local government offered an additional of ¥20,000 renminbi ($3,100) to those who agreed to settle their claims by the deadline.The New York Times journalists, however, reported that some owners had faced heavy pressure from government officials to settle; similarly, owners who were employees in state-owned enterprises were under threat of dismissal from their bosses for not settling.\n\nOn 10 September 2015 China Daily reported that families of the firefighters killed in the explosions would each receive compensation of 2.3 million yuan (US$360,669), citing a report in Beijing News.It was reported that a monument would be built on the site and that the government planned to compensate residents whose houses were damaged by repurchasing them at 130% of their purchase price.\n\nLess than a month after the disaster, the Tianjin government announced a proposal to turn the site into an ""ecological park"", repurposing the explosion crater as a lake and promising a memorial to the victims to be built on site.The proposal was heavily criticized on Chinese social media, which derided the rushed announcement as an attempt to erase the damage and avoid accountability.The resulting , opened in early 2017, was further criticized for being an extremely rushed and sloppy design.Both the crater lake and the proposed memorial were ultimately discarded; as a result, there is currently no permanent memorial to the disaster.\n\n2023 Yinchuan gas explosion 2020 Beirut explosion 2019 Xiangshui chemical plant explosion 2015 Dongying explosion 2014 Shanghai stampede 2014 Kunshan explosion 1988 PEPCON

72,"{'Wiki_Title': '2015 Tianjin explosions', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'On 12 August 2015, a series of explosions at the Port of Tianjin in Tianjin, Northern China, killed 173 people, according to official reports, and injured hundreds of others.The explosions occurred at a container storage station in the Binhai New Area of Tianjin, China.The first two explosions occurred 33 seconds apart.The second explosion was much larger and involved the detonation of about 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate (approx.256 tonnes TNT equivalent).Fires caused by the initial explosions continued to burn uncontrolled throughout the weekend, resulting in eight additional explosions on 15 August.\n\nThe cause of the explosions was not immediately known, but an investigation concluded in February 2016 that an overheated container of dry nitrocellulose was the cause of the initial explosion.The official casualty report was 173 deaths, eight missing, and 798 non-fatal injuries.Of the 173 fatalities, 104 were firefighters.\n\nTianjin Dongjiang Port Ruihai International Logistics (), or Ruihai Logistics (), is a privately held logistics company established in 2011.It handled hazardous chemicals within the Port of Tianjin, such as flammable and corrosive substances, oxidizing agents, and toxic chemicals.The company, which employed 70, was designated by the Tianjin Maritime Safety Administration () as an approved agent for handling these hazardous chemicals at the port, and its operating license was renewed two months prior to the explosions.Its site, roughly the size of two city blocks, contained multiple warehouses for hazardous goods, a fire pump and a fire pond.\n\nThe warehouse building, owned by Ruihai Logistics, is recorded in a 2014 government document as being a hazardous chemical storage facility for calcium carbide, sodium nitrate, and potassium nitrate.Safety regulations requiring that public buildings and facilities should be at least 1 kilometre away were not followed, and local inhabitants were unaware of the danger.The authorities stated that poor record keeping, damage to the office facilities and ""major discrepancies"" with customs meant that they were unable to identify the substances stored.State media revealed that Ruihai had only received its authorisation to handle dangerous chemicals less than two months earlier, meaning that it had been operating illegally from October 2014, when its temporary license had expired, to June 2015.\n\nThe first reports of a fire at a warehouse in the Binhai New Area began coming in at around 22:50 local time (14:50 UTC) on 12 August.The first responders were unable to keep the fire from spreading.Firefighters who first arrived on the scene proceeded to douse the fire with water as they were unaware that dangerous chemicals were stored on the site, thereby setting in motion a series of more violent chemical reactions.\n\nAt around 23:30 (15:30 UTC), the first explosion occurred and registered as a magnitude 2.3 earthquake, generating seismic shock-waves energetically equivalent to 2.9 tonnes of TNT.After 30 seconds, a second violent explosion occurred, causing most of the damage and injuries with shock-waves felt many kilometres away.The second explosion registered as a magnitude 2.9 earthquake and generated seismic shock-waves with energy equivalent to 21.9 tonnes of TNT.The resulting fireballs reached hundreds of meters in height.Around 23:40 (15:40 UTC) on 15 August, a series of eight smaller explosions occurred in the port as fire from the original blasts continued to spread.The total energy release was equivalent to 28 tonnes of TNT, or 100GJ.\n\nThe explosion was large enough to be photographed by Himawari, a geostationary meteorological satellite operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).Chinese scientists subsequently estimated that the second more powerful explosion involved the detonation of about 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, based on crater size and lethality radius (336 tons TNT equivalent, based on relative effectiveness factor of 0.42).\n\nOne month after the explosion, official reports listed 173 deaths and 797 injuries.Media reported the area to be densely populated, with around 5,600 families living within radius of the plant, the closest being only away.Neither the developers nor the buyers were aware of the latent dangers of the activities at the nearby site; developers claimed also to be victims.According to the Tianjin government, more than 700 people were injured by the explosion, many with extensive injuries, mostly from burns and explosive blast injuries.Over a thousand firefighters were on scene, and 95 were killed.One surviving firefighter from his team, a 19-year-old named ZhouTi (), was found on the morning of 14 August.The death toll, which also included 11 police officers, was the worst in a single incident for Chinese front line responders since the founding of the People\'s Republic of China in 1949.\n\nPhotographs and videos showed extensive destruction in and around the warehouse compound, with an enormous crater at the blast site.The buildings of seven more surrounding logistics companies were destroyed, and large quantities of intermodal container stacks were toppled and thrown by the forces of the explosions.More than eight thousand new cars from Hyundai, Kia, Volkswagen, Renault, and Toyota, parked in lots located near the blast site, were largely burned as a result of the initial explosions.Multiple buildings surrounding the blast site were declared ""structurally unsafe"".In total, 304 buildings, 12,428 cars, and 7,533 intermodal containers were damaged.Beyond insurance, the cost to businesses of the break in the supply chain caused by the explosions was estimated at $9 billion, making it the third most expensive supply chain disruption of 2015.\n\nApartment blocks from the site sustained shattered glass, loss of roof tiles and damage to ceilings – with 17,000 units being affected.Nearby Donghai Road Station suffered severe damage as a result of the explosions and was closed until 2016, as was the rest of Line 9 of the Tianjin Metro beginning on 13 August.A Japanese department store four kilometres away reported damage to walls and ceilings.The explosions also affected the National Supercomputing Center of Tianjin several kilometres away, knocking out windows and causing some internal ceilings to collapse; the center\'s supercomputer Tianhe-1A itself was not damaged.\n\nIt is not known what chemicals were being stored at the site.In addition to vast quantities of sodium cyanide and calcium carbide, paperwork was discovered showing that 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate and 500 tonnes of potassium nitrate were at the blast site.On 17 August, the deputy director of the public security bureau\'s fire department told CCTV:\n\nAmmonium nitrate, which is predominantly used as an agricultural fertilizer, oxidizing agent in explosive compositions, and in manufacturing of other chemicals, has been the cause of a number of other fatal industrial explosions.A fire department spokesman confirmed that firefighters had used water in combating the initial fire, which may have led to water being sprayed on calcium carbide, releasing the highly flammable gas acetylene.This would have provided the fuel source for reaction with the oxidizer, ammonium nitrate, thus triggering its detonation more readily.\n\nAt least 700 tonnes of highly toxic sodium cyanide was stored at the site – 70 times the legal limit.Sodium cyanide leakage was reported in the sewer.On 13 August, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, all of which are toxic, were detected within of the origin of the explosion, but the levels conformed with the national standards.Gases were undetectable from the site during initial testing on 14 August.\n\nWhen the first rains after the initial explosions arrived on 18 August, white chemical foam covered the streets.Citizens complained of burning sensations and rashes on sensitive skin regions after coming into contact with rain droplets.However, meteorologists and health experts sought to reassure the public that the rain was not directly harmful to health, whilst the Environment Protection Board advised against exposure to the rain due to traces of cyanide dust reacting with water.\n\nThousands of dead sticklebacks washed up on the banks 6 km from the explosion site on 20 August, fuelling fears of water contamination.Officials downplayed the fears, saying that there were not high levels of cyanide in the river and that the fish likely died due to oxygen depletion in the water.\n\nMore precipitation throughout August in the Binhai New Area brought more complaints of skin irritations and burns from volunteers and journalists.A bright white foam manifested yet again on the streets in a similar manner to before.Deng Xiaowen, director of Tianjin\'s environmental monitoring centre, stated that the foam was ""a normal phenomenon when rain falls, and similar things have occurred before"".\n\nOn Thursday morning, the Chinese leaders ordered officers in the city to make full effort in rescuing the injured, and search for those missing.Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and Li Keqiang, the Premier of the People\'s Republic of China, instructed police to investigate the cause of the incident and punish those responsible for the blast.\n\nTianjin officials, concerned at the potential public response, announced initially that fourteen people had perished in the explosions, but later raised the death toll to forty-four once the scale of the explosions became clear.The South China Morning Post (SCMP) cited a Tianjin police source that officers had been instructed to remove bodies from the scene to deliberately understate the official death toll, which angered the Tianjin government.\n\nThe morning following the explosion, military personnel began to arrive in Tianjin to help with the search and recovery efforts.Extra equipment, such as bulldozers, were brought in to help with the clean-up operation.Over 200 nuclear and biochemical experts, including a team from the International Atomic Energy Agency, began arriving in Tianjin to assess the health risks from the chemicals being released into the atmosphere.Government personnel set up twelve temporary monitoring stations near the blast site with above-normal levels of pollutants being detected.A nearby drainage outlet was also closed, and water quality tested.\n\nFirefighting was suspended on the afternoon of 13 August due to the uncertainty of the content and quantity of hazardous materials being stored on site.A team of over two hundred chemical specialists was deployed to assess the hazardous materials on site and dangers to the environment, and to determine the best way to put out the remaining fires and proceed with search and rescue and clean-up operations.Later that day, rescue personnel were dispatched in an attempt to remove the 700 tonnes of sodium cyanide believed to be stored at the site, with hydrogen peroxide being prepared to neutralise the chemicals.Daily press conferences were organised.A press conference organised by local officials held on 14 August came to an abrupt end when a journalist began asking questions as to why such dangerous chemicals were stockpiled so close to housing estates.\n\nInitially, more than 3,500 area residents were staying in temporary shelters, but the number surpassed 6,000 within three days.The government issued an evacuation order over concerns of further explosions; not all residents complied.\n\nOn 15 August, local authorities ordered the evacuation of residents within a radius of the blast site, prompted by the threat of ""toxic substances"", including sodium cyanide.\n\nThe State Council ordered inspections of all businesses using dangerous chemicals and explosives across the country.\n\nHong Kong media announced that Li Liang, the major shareholder of Ruihai Logistics – owning 55%, was the nephew of former chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and ex-party chief of Tianjin, Li Ruihuan, and that the company may have been named after his brother and Li Liang\'s father; the remaining 45% was owned by Shu Zheng.Reports in state media one week after the explosion were contradictory, holding that Ruihai was owned via proxies by Yu Xuewei, the chairman of Ruihai and a former senior executive at Sinochem, and Dong Shexuan, who served as the company\'s vice-president and who had been arrested by police by the time of the reports.Dong Shexuan is the son of Tianjin port\'s former police chief Dong Peijun, who was a colleague of Wu Changshun, the former chief of the public security bureau of Tianjin.The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), CPC\'s anti-corruption body, charged Wu Changshun with bribery in 2014; Dong Peijun was also under investigation for corruption, but died that year.\n\nAfter the explosions, the CCDI placed Yang Dongliang, Director of the State Administration of Work Safety and China\'s highest work-safety official, under investigation on 18 August 2015.Yang had previously served as Tianjin\'s vice mayor for 11 years.In 2012, Yang Dongliang had issued an order to loosen rules for the handling of hazardous substances, which may have enabled Ruihai to store toxic chemicals such as sodium cyanide.\n\nOn 27 August, Xinhua reported that police had arrested twelve people with suspected connections to the explosions, including Ruihai Logistics\' chairman, vice-chairman, and at least three other managers, with the other seven people unnamed.\n\nOn 5 February 2016, the Chinese

that led to the disaster.Yu Xuewei, the Chairman of Ruihai Logistics, was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve.\n\nImmediately following the blasts, the company website was taken down, fuelling suspicions that an attempt was being made to shield owners with powerful political connections.For several days, local residents seeking compensation for their homes protested in front of the venue of the daily press conference.They were joined by distraught families of missing firefighters and confronted police angrily.\n\nThe Chinese public security minister threatened severe punishment for those

Sinochem subsidiaries – Sinochem Tianjin Binhai Logistics Company (with a site) and Tianjin Port Sinochem Hazardous Goods Logistics Company Ltd. – had warehouses in the vicinity in close proximity to a primary and a nursery school, meaning that both were in similar breach of laws.\n\nObservers stated that top officials always attempt to show such disasters as isolated instances, have never

than 9,000 households out of some 17,000 affected by the explosions had signed agreements to settle their damages claims.It was reported that some had chosen to sell their damaged apartments to private developers, who offered them around 130% of the original purchase price, while others accepted an offer from the local government promising to fix the damaged apartments.The local government

with shock-waves felt many kilometres away.The second explosion registered as a magnitude 2.9 earthquake and generated seismic shock-waves with energy equivalent to 21.9 tonnes of TNT.The resulting fireballs reached hundreds of meters in height.Around 23:40 (15:40 UTC) on 15 August, a series of eight smaller explosions occurred in the port as fire from the original blasts continued to spread.The total energy release was equivalent to 28 tonnes of TNT, or 100GJ.\n\nThe explosion was large enough to be photographed by Himawari, a geostationary meteorological satellite operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).Chinese scientists subsequently estimated that the second more powerful explosion involved the detonation of about 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, based on crater size and lethality radius (336 tons TNT equivalent, based on relative effectiveness factor of 0.42).\n\nOne month after the explosion, official reports listed 173 deaths and 797 injuries.Media reported the area to be densely populated, with around 5,600 families living within radius of the plant, the closest being only away.Neither the developers nor the buyers were aware of the latent dangers of the activities at the nearby site; developers claimed also to be victims.According to the Tianjin government, more than 700 people were injured by the explosion, many with extensive injuries, mostly from burns and explosive blast injuries.Over a thousand firefighters were on scene, and 95 were killed.One surviving firefighter from his team, a 19-year-old named ZhouTi (), was found on the morning of 14 August.The death toll, which also included 11 police officers, was the worst in a single incident for Chinese front line responders since the founding of the People\'s Republic of China in 1949.\n\nPhotographs and videos showed extensive destruction in and around the warehouse compound, with an enormous crater at the blast site.The buildings of seven more surrounding logistics companies were destroyed, and large quantities of intermodal container stacks were toppled and thrown by the forces of the explosions.More than eight thousand new cars from Hyundai, Kia, Volkswagen, Renault, and Toyota, parked in lots located near the blast site, were largely burned as a result of the initial explosions.Multiple buildings surrounding the blast site were declared ""structurally unsafe"".In total, 304 buildings, 12,428 cars, and 7,533 intermodal containers were damaged.Beyond insurance, the cost to businesses of the break in the supply chain caused by the explosions was estimated at $9 billion, making it the third most expensive supply chain disruption of 2015.\n\nApartment blocks from the site sustained shattered glass, loss of roof tiles and damage to ceilings – with 17,000 units being affected.Nearby Donghai Road Station suffered severe damage as a result of the explosions and was closed until 2016, as was the rest of Line 9 of the Tianjin Metro beginning on 13 August.A Japanese department store four kilometres away reported damage to walls and ceilings.The explosions also affected the National Supercomputing Center of Tianjin several kilometres away, knocking out windows and causing some internal ceilings to collapse; the center\'s supercomputer Tianhe-1A itself was not damaged.\n\nIt is not known what chemicals were being stored at the site.In addition to vast quantities of sodium cyanide and calcium carbide, paperwork was discovered showing that 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate and 500 tonnes of potassium nitrate were at the blast site.On 17 August, the deputy director of the public security bureau\'s fire department told CCTV:\n\nAmmonium nitrate, which is predominantly used as an agricultural fertilizer, oxidizing agent in explosive compositions, and in manufacturing of other chemicals, has been the cause of a number of other fatal industrial explosions.A fire department spokesman confirmed that firefighters had used water in combating the initial fire, which may have led to water being sprayed on calcium carbide, releasing the highly flammable gas acetylene.This would have provided the fuel source for reaction with the oxidizer, ammonium nitrate, thus triggering its detonation more readily.\n\nAt least 700 tonnes of highly toxic sodium cyanide was stored at the site – 70 times the legal limit.Sodium cyanide leakage was reported in the sewer.On 13 August, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, all of which are toxic, were detected within of the origin of the explosion, but the levels conformed with the national standards.Gases were undetectable from the site during initial testing on 14 August.\n\nWhen the first rains after the initial explosions arrived on 18 August, white chemical foam covered the streets.Citizens complained of burning sensations and rashes on sensitive skin regions after coming into contact with rain droplets.However, meteorologists and health experts sought to reassure the public that the rain was not directly harmful to health, whilst the Environment Protection Board advised against exposure to the rain due to traces of cyanide dust reacting with water.\n\nThousands of dead sticklebacks washed up on the banks 6 km from the explosion site on 20 August, fuelling fears of water contamination.Officials downplayed the fears, saying that there were not high levels of cyanide in the river and that the fish likely died due to oxygen depletion in the water.\n\nMore precipitation throughout August in the Binhai New Area brought more complaints of skin irritations and burns from volunteers and journalists.A bright white foam manifested yet again on the streets in a similar manner to before.Deng Xiaowen, director of Tianjin\'s environmental monitoring centre, stated that the foam was ""a normal phenomenon when rain falls, and similar things have occurred before"".\n\nOn Thursday morning, the Chinese leaders ordered officers in the city to make full effort in rescuing the injured, and search for those missing.Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and Li Keqiang, the Premier of the People\'s Republic of China, instructed police to investigate the cause of the incident and punish those responsible for the blast.\n\nTianjin officials, concerned at the potential public response, announced initially that fourteen people had perished in the explosions, but later raised the death toll to forty-four once the scale of the explosions became clear.The South China Morning Post (SCMP) cited a Tianjin police source that officers had been instructed to remove bodies from the scene to deliberately understate the official death toll, which angered the Tianjin government.\n\nThe morning following the explosion, military personnel began to arrive in Tianjin to help with the search and recovery efforts.Extra equipment, such as bulldozers, were brought in to help with the clean-up operation.Over 200 nuclear and biochemical experts, including a team from the International Atomic Energy Agency, began arriving in Tianjin to assess the health risks from the chemicals being released into the atmosphere.Government personnel set up twelve temporary monitoring stations near the blast site with above-normal levels of pollutants being detected.A nearby drainage outlet was also closed, and water quality tested.\n\nFirefighting was suspended on the afternoon of 13 August due to the uncertainty of the content and quantity of hazardous materials being stored on site.A team of over two hundred chemical specialists was deployed to assess the hazardous materials on site and dangers to the environment, and to determine the best way to put out the remaining fires and proceed with search and rescue and clean-up operations.Later that day, rescue personnel were dispatched in an attempt to remove the 700 tonnes of sodium cyanide believed to be stored at the site, with hydrogen peroxide being prepared to neutralise the chemicals.Daily press conferences were organised.A press conference organised by local officials held on 14 August came to an abrupt end when a journalist began asking questions as to why such dangerous chemicals were stockpiled so close to housing estates.\n\nInitially, more than 3,500 area residents were staying in temporary shelters, but the number surpassed 6,000 within three days.The government issued an evacuation order over concerns of further explosions; not all residents complied.\n\nOn 15 August, local authorities ordered the evacuation of residents within a radius of the blast site, prompted by the threat of ""toxic substances"", including sodium cyanide.\n\nThe State Council ordered inspections of all businesses using dangerous chemicals and explosives across the country.\n\nHong Kong media announced that Li Liang, the major shareholder of Ruihai Logistics – owning 55%, was the nephew of former chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and ex-party chief of Tianjin, Li Ruihuan, and that the company may have been named after his brother and Li Liang\'s father; the remaining 45% was owned by Shu Zheng.Reports in state media one week after the explosion were contradictory, holding that Ruihai was owned via proxies by Yu Xuewei, the chairman of Ruihai and a former senior executive at Sinochem, and Dong Shexuan, who served as the company\'s vice-president and who had been arrested by police by the time of the reports.Dong Shexuan is the son of Tianjin port\'s former police chief Dong Peijun, who was a colleague of Wu Changshun, the former chief of the public security bureau of Tianjin.The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), CPC\'s anti-corruption body, charged Wu Changshun with bribery in 2014; Dong Peijun was also under investigation for corruption, but died that year.\n\nAfter the explosions, the CCDI placed Yang Dongliang, Director of the State Administration of Work Safety and China\'s highest work-safety official, under investigation on 18 August 2015.Yang had previously served as Tianjin\'s vice mayor for 11 years.In 2012, Yang Dongliang had issued an order to loosen rules for the handling of hazardous substances, which may have enabled Ruihai to store toxic chemicals such as sodium cyanide.\n\nOn 27 August, Xinhua reported that police had arrested twelve people with suspected connections to the explosions, including Ruihai Logistics\' chairman, vice-chairman, and at least three other managers, with the other seven people unnamed.\n\nOn 5 February 2016, the Chinese government issued the investigation report of the explosions.The report concluded the fire started in a container through auto-ignition of nitrocellulose, due to vaporization of the wetting agent during hot weather.\n\nOn 8 November 2016, various courts in China handed jail sentences to 49 government officials and warehouse executives and staff for their roles in circumventing the safety rules that led to the disaster.Yu Xuewei, the Chairman of Ruihai Logistics, was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve.\n\nImmediately following the blasts, the company website was taken down, fuelling suspicions that an attempt was being made to shield owners with powerful political connections.For several days, local residents seeking compensation for their homes protested in front of the venue of the daily press conference.They were joined by distraught families of missing firefighters and confronted police angrily.\n\nThe Chinese public security minister threatened severe punishment for those found to be responsible for the explosions.However, the authorities did not release any significant information for several days about the chemicals and circumstances, causing public anger to mount during this time.Marking an official change of tack that suggested top-level endorsement, the official People\'s Daily joined in to criticise local officials\' lack of candour and their use of bureaucratic jargon.In addition, the Global Times remarked on the inadequacy of emergency response and the reluctance of high-ranking officials to answer the public\'s questions or address their concerns until four days after the blasts.The People\'s Daily acknowledged that public scepticism of the reported death toll was fuelling rampant rumours; there was disquiet over the emergency assistance provided and the way the aftermath was being handled.Attempting to defuse widespread anger at the lack of official transparency, mouthpieces of the ruling party declared that investigations would be thorough and transparent.Former deputy mayor Yang Dongliang was put under investigation for corruption; mayor Huang Xingguo proclaimed his ""unshirkable responsibility for this accident"".Authorities released information about the ownership of Ruihai, as well as a confession by one beneficial owner for the proxy shareholdings.\n\nMeanwhile, Greenpeace Asia alleged that two Sinochem subsidiaries – Sinochem Tianjin Binhai Logistics Company (with a site) and Tianjin Port Sinochem Hazardous Goods Logistics Company Ltd. – had warehouses in the vicinity in close proximity to a primary and a nursery school, meaning that both were in similar breach of laws.\n\nObservers stated that top officials always attempt to show such disasters as isolated instances, have never accepted political accountability nor addressed the underlying governance issues, and have always heavily censored any criticism of the central government.Willy Lam, professor at CUHK and senior fellow at The Jamestown Foundation, noted the highly unusual period of four days it took for Li Keqiang to make an official visit, suggesting that the lack of a top-ranking visitor to a major disaster site within forty-eight hours despite the proximity to Beijing reflected ""division among the leadership on who should be the fall guy.""\n\nInitially, Tianjin authorities banned editors and reporters from sharing information about the disaster on Weibo and WeChat, and websites were ordered to follow state media.\n\nThe Tianjin internet police warned social media users to use only official casualty figures.\n\nTianjin Television had reported the explosion on their early morning news at 7:00 am, but citizens complained that the station had not reported live nor updated on the event, instead showing soap operas eight hours later.\n\nA great deal of specific information on the event, including the majority of early stage video, was first released over social media sites, and in particular microblogging platforms like Weibo.Major media has drawn heavily from social media sources, greatly widening the audience.The Economist noted, ""Social media fills in the blanks left by official narratives of the Tianjin disaster.The most remarkable feature of the aftermath of the explosions in Tianjin, in Northern China, has been the extraordinary contrast between the official reaction to the crisis, which has been profoundly flawed, and the online reaction, which has entirely dominated the agenda.""\n\nProfessional and social media reports were censored by Chinese authorities.The censorship rate increased tenfold on the social media site Weibo, with users reporting the deletion of their posts regarding the blasts, with ""Tianjin"" and ""explosion"" being the most censored words.An article by Caijing, which carried an interview with a firefighter who said that no-one on the front line had been informed of the dangerous chemicals on site that would react exothermically when mixed with water, was deleted after it had been reposted 10,000 times; many other posts mentioning the existence of deadly sodium cyanide were also expunged.\n\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China banned all journalists from posting to social media, and insisted on strict adherence to Xinhua\'s editorial line.On 15 August, it announced that it had shut down 18 websites and suspended 32 more for spreading false information.More than 360 Weibo and public WeChat accounts which had allegedly been spreading such false rumors have been ""punished according to laws"".Of these accounts, over 160 were shut down permanently.\n\nPress freedom organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF) accused the Chinese state media of playing up the heroic efforts of rescue workers and firefighters while downplaying the causes of the explosions and the number of casualties.RSF said that censorship by the Chinese authorities showed ""a flagrant indifference to the public\'s legitimate concerns"".\n\nA CNN correspondent was interrupted by bystanders and forced to leave during a live report outside TEDA Hospital.A journalist from the Beijing News reported that he and two other reporters were chased by police, caught, searched, and made to delete photographs from their cameras and computers.\n\nTianjin officials announced that as at the deadline on 3 September 2015, more than 9,000 households out of some 17,000 affected by the explosions had signed agreements to settle their damages claims.It was reported that some had chosen to sell their damaged apartments to private developers, who offered them around 130% of the original purchase price, while others accepted an offer from the local government promising to fix the damaged apartments.The local government offered an additional of ¥20,000 renminbi ($3,100) to those who agreed to settle their claims by the deadline.The New York Times journalists, however, reported that some owners had faced heavy pressure from government officials to settle; similarly, owners who were employees in state-owned enterprises were under threat of dismissal from their bosses for not settling.\n\nOn 10 September 2015 China Daily reported that families of the firefighters killed in the explosions would each receive compensation of 2.3 million yuan (US$360,669), citing a report in Beijing News.It was reported that a monument would be built on the site and that the government planned to compensate residents whose houses were damaged by repurchasing them at 130% of their purchase price.\n\nLess than a month after the disaster, the Tianjin government announced a proposal to turn the site into an ""ecological park"", repurposing the explosion crater as a lake and promising a memorial to the victims to be built on site.The proposal was heavily criticized on Chinese social media, which derided the rushed announcement as an attempt to erase the damage and avoid accountability.The resulting , opened in early 2017, was further criticized for being an extremely rushed and sloppy design.Both the crater lake and the proposed memorial were ultimately discarded; as a result, there is currently no permanent memorial to the disaster.\n\n2023 Yinchuan gas explosion 2020 Beirut explosion 2019 Xiangshui chemical plant explosion 2015 Dongying explosion 2014 Shanghai stampede 2014 Kunshan explosion 1988 PEPCON

74,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Impeachment of Park Geun-hye', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The impeachment of Park Geun-hye, President of South Korea, was the culmination of a political scandal involving interventions to the presidency from her aide, Choi Soon-sil.The impeachment vote took place on 9 December 2016, with 234 members of the 300-member National Assembly voting in favour of the impeachment and temporary suspension of Park Geun-hye\'s presidential powers and duties.This exceeded the required two-thirds threshold in the National Assembly and, although the vote was by secret ballot, the results indicated that more than half of the 128 lawmakers in Park\'s party Saenuri had supported her impeachment.Thus, Hwang Kyo-ahn, then Prime Minister of South Korea, became Acting President while the Constitutional Court of Korea was due to determine whether to accept the impeachment.The court upheld the impeachment in a unanimous 8–0 decision on 10 March 2017, removing Park from office.The regularly scheduled presidential election was advanced to 9 May 2017, and Moon Jae-in, former leader of the Democratic Party, was elected as Park\'s permanent successor.\n\nPark was formally sentenced to 24 years in prison on 6 April 2018 after being found guilty of abuse of power and coercion.This was later raised to 25 years and a fine of ₩20 billion (US$17.86 million) following an appeal by prosecutors.President Moon would go on to pardon Park Geun-hye on compassionate grounds in December 2021.She was ultimately released and later returned home in March 2022.\n\nThe procedure for impeachment is set out in the 10th Constitution of South Korea in 1987.According to Article 65 Clause 1, if the President, Prime Minister, or other state council members violate the Constitution or other laws of official duty, the National Assembly can impeach them.\n\nClause 2 states the impeachment bill must be proposed by one third, and approved by a majority of members of the National Assembly for passage.In the case of the President, the motion must be proposed by a majority and approved by two thirds or more of the total members of the National Assembly, meaning that 200 of 300 members of the parliament must vote to approve the bill.This article also states that any person against whom a motion for impeachment has been passed shall be suspended from exercising his/her power until the impeachment has been adjudicated, and a decision on impeachment shall not extend further than removal from public office.However, impeachment shall not exempt the person impeached from civil or criminal liability for such violations.\n\nBy the Constitutional Court Act of 1988, the Constitutional Court must make a final decision within 180 days after it receives any case for adjudication, including impeachment cases.If the respondent has already left office before the pronouncement of the decision, the case is dismissed.\n\nThe last president to be subject to impeachment was Roh Moo-hyun, who was impeached by the National Assembly in 2004 and was suspended from duties for two months.In that case, the Constitutional Court of Korea acquitted Roh and restored him to power, with the South Korean public by and large in support of Roh.\n\nRevelations emerged in late October 2016, that President Park Geun-hye\'s aide, Choi Soon-sil, who did not have an official position in the government, had used her position to seek donations of money from several business conglomerates (known as chaebol), including Samsung, Hyundai, SK Group and Lotte, to two foundations she controlled.These revelations were first revealed when Park\'s unofficial clothier Ko Young-tae revealed evidence to the media of the nature of Park and Choi\'s relationship which suggested Choi\'s access to Park\'s personal and work life, and Choi was said to have directly influenced, and interfered with the policies of the Park government and to have edited Park\'s presidential speeches.Media investigations also reported that Choi and President Park\'s senior staff members, including both Ahn Jong-bum and Jeong Ho-sung, have allegedly used their influence to extort ₩77.4 billion ($60 million) from Korean chaebols—family-owned large business conglomerates—and set up two culture- and sports-related foundations, Mir and K-sports foundations.\n\nOn 25 October 2016, Park apologized to the nation in a televised address from the Blue House for giving Choi access to draft speeches during the first months of her presidency.Protests began on 26 October calling on President Park\'s resignation.Three days later, she dismissed her top aides including chief of staff Kim Ki-choon and two members of the cabinet and attempted to replace prime minister Hwang Kyo-ahn with Kim Byong-joon, a former aide to former president Roh Moo-hyun, but this was rejected by the National Assembly.\n\nOn 31 October, Choi Soon-sil was arrested by prosecutors, having concluded that there was enough evidence for an indictment.She was formally charged with abuse of power and fraud on 20 November.\n\nPark made a second apology on 4 November, pledging to take responsibility if she was found guilty, and a third apology on 29 November, calling for the National Assembly to decide the manner of her departure, but this was rejected by the opposition-controlled legislature.Protests across South Korea began on 26 October with Park\'s approval rating dropping to 4%, and according to an opinion poll, as of 9 December 78% of South Koreans supported her impeachment.President Park appointed Park Young-soo, former head of the Seoul High Prosecutors\' Office, as a special prosecutor to investigate the allegations on 30 November.\n\nChoi\'s daughter Chung Yoo-ra was also sought by prosecutors as a key witness.When she did not return to Korea for the investigation, an Interpol warrant was put out for her arrest.She was arrested in Denmark on 1 January 2017, and extradited to Korea in May.In late 2016 and early 2017, the German Federal Police began investigating Choi and Chung for money laundering.\n\nThe response to the Sewol ferry sinking accident that occurred on 16 April 2014 also contributed to Park\'s declining presidential ratings.\n\nOn 3 December 2016, at 4:10 am, Woo Sang-ho of the Democratic Party, Park Jie-won of the People\'s Party, and Roh Hoe-chan of the Justice Party moved the ""President (Park Geun-hye) impeachment proposal"" in the National Assembly on behalf of 171 members of their respective parties and other independent representatives, on the grounds that Geun-hye had violated the Constitution and the law.Park\'s Saenuri Party initially preferred Park to voluntarily step down in late April, but with mounting protests, the ruling party became divided on whether Park should step down voluntarily or be impeached.On 4 December, members of Saenuri\'s ""non-mainstream"" factions declared that they would vote in favour of Park\'s impeachment.\n\nThe 300-member National Assembly was scheduled to vote on an impeachment bill on 9 December, at the end of the legislative session.As impeachment against president requires a two-thirds supermajority, at least 200 members would have to vote to impeach, in which case Park would be impeached and immediately suspended from her office.There were up to 172 opposition and independent lawmakers, which meant at least 28 of the 128 MPs from the ruling Saenuri Party needed to cross the floor and join the opposition in supporting the impeachment measure for the vote to pass.\n\nOn 8 December, the South Korean National Assembly announced that the vote on the motion to impeach would take place on 9 December, at 3:00 pm local time.The opposition parties pledged to resign their seats in the National Assembly if the impeachment motion failed to pass.On 9 December, the National Assembly approved the impeachment motion by a vote of 234 in favour and 56 against in a secret ballot.The Speaker of the National Assembly (who happens to be unaffiliated with any party) abstained from the vote.Two other MPs abstained from voting and seven votes were declared invalid.\n\nAs a result of the motion\'s passage, President Park\'s powers and duties were suspended for up to 180 days while the Constitutional Court of Korea considered the validity of the impeachment motion.It was necessary for six of the nine judges on that court to agree with the impeachment for the removal to take effect.\n\nPresident Park held a final cabinet meeting acknowledging the impeachment motion and apologised for causing uncertainty, before Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn assumed presidential powers and duties at 19:30 Korean Standard Time, on an interim basis.\n\nProtesters congregated outside the National Assembly hall where the voting session was held.Some 40 family members of the victims of the sinking of MV Sewol looked on as lawmakers cast their secret ballots.Citizens who have been rallying in massive numbers against Park rejoiced at the news, while Park\'s supporters called the parliamentary impeachment a ""witch-hunt"" without concrete evidence of Park\'s wrongdoings.\n\nOn 1 January 2017, Park appeared in public for the first time since the impeachment before a select group of reporters at the Blue House, saying she denied any allegations of the scandal and wrongdoings.\n\nThe South Korean Constitutional Court had up to 180 days (until early June 2017) to decide on the issue.It held public hearings to hear from both sides on whether the National Assembly had followed due process and the impeachment was justified.\n\nThe Constitutional Court has been considered generally conservative, as all nine judges of the Constitutional Court were appointed during the conservative Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye administrations.The Constitutional Court was to start the Preparatory Hearing on 22 December, with initial views from both sides.\n\nThe first impeachment trial focused on the whereabouts of Park Geun-hye seven hours after the Sewol ferry sinking.The administration\'s delayed response to the disaster led to widespread criticism in South Korea and forced Park to deny various rumours.Then, on 23 December the Justice Ministry of South Korea said that it has submitted its views on the recent parliamentary vote to impeach President Park Geun-hye to the Constitutional Court, adding that the process has met all the necessary legal requirements.\n\nThe Constitutional Court was to officially start the main hearings on Tuesday, 3 January 2017, and Park would not be required to appear for questioning.Park was absent at the first open hearing and the first session was closed after just nine minutes.The hearings were rescheduled to start on 5 January 2017.The trial heard arguments and evidence until 27 February.\n\nOn 6 March, special prosecutor Park Young-soo announced the results of his probe into the Choi and Park allegations, finding evidence of collusion between Park and Choi to solicit bribes from Samsung Group and blacklisting more than 9,000 artists, authors, and movie industry professionals from government assistance that constituted an abuse of power.This opened the possibility of Park\'s indictment if the Constitutional Court upheld the National Assembly\'s impeachment motion.\n\nOn 10 March 2017, 11.00 am KST, the Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment in a unanimous 8–0 decision read out by Acting Chief Justice Lee Jung Mi, formally ending Park\'s presidency.This marked the first time that a sitting president was removed from the office since the creation of the Sixth Republic of South Korea after the country\'s democratization in 1987.Both supporters and opponents of Park had gathered outside the Constitutional Court building for the verdict.Three died and dozens were injured as a result of the ensuing clashes between her supporters and police.\n\nAs a result of impeachment, Park was stripped of her post-presidential benefits such as retirement pension, free medical services, state funding for her post-retirement office, personal assistants and a chauffeur, and right to burial at the Seoul National Cemetery after death.However, she is entitled to retain security protection under the Presidential Security Act.\n\nPark left the Blue House on the evening of 11 March and was welcomed to her home by supporters.She was arrested and placed into custody after an indictment by prosecutors on charges of bribery, abuse of power, coercion, and leaking government secrets on 31 March.\n\nAfter Park\'s removal from office, Prime Minister Hwang remained as Acting President.A presidential election was already scheduled for December 2017.However, it was advanced to 9 May 2017, as the constitution requires new elections within 60 days of a permanent presidential vacancy.In that election, Moon Jae-in was elected as the 12th president of South Korea.\n\nIn July 2018, it emerged that the Defense Security Command made plans for declaring martial law and authority to use military force to crackdown on protesters, if the Constitutional Court did not uphold Park\'s removal from office.The DSC had planned to mobilize 200 tanks, 550 armoured vehicles, 4,800 armed personnel, and 1,400 members of special forces in Seoul in order to enforce martial law.Other components of the plan included monitoring and censoring media content and arresting politicians taking part in protests.\n\nOn 6 April 2018, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison, after being found guilty of abuse of power and coercion.This was later raised to 25 years and a fine of ₩20 billion (US$17.86 million) following an appeal by prosecutors.She was

regularly scheduled presidential election was advanced to 9 May 2017, and Moon Jae-in, former leader of the Democratic Party, was elected as Park\'s permanent successor.\n\nPark was formally sentenced to 24 years in prison on 6 April 2018 after being found guilty of abuse of power and coercion.This was later raised to 25 years and a fine of ₩20 billion (US$17.86 million) following an appeal by prosecutors.President Moon would go on to pardon Park Geun-hye on compassionate grounds in December 2021.She was ultimately released and later returned home in March 2022.\n\nThe procedure for impeachment is set out in the 10th Constitution of South Korea in 1987.According to Article 65 Clause 1, if the President, Prime Minister, or other state council members violate the Constitution or other laws of official duty, the National Assembly can impeach them.\n\nClause 2 states the impeachment bill must be proposed by one third, and approved by a majority of members of the National Assembly for passage.In the case of the President, the motion must be proposed by a majority and approved by two thirds or more of the total members of the National Assembly, meaning that 200 of 300 members of the parliament must vote to approve the bill.This article also states that any person against whom a motion for impeachment has been passed shall be suspended from exercising his/her power until the impeachment has been adjudicated, and a decision on impeachment shall not extend further than removal from public office.However, impeachment shall not exempt the person impeached from civil or criminal liability for such violations.\n\nBy the Constitutional Court Act of 1988, the Constitutional Court must make a final decision within 180 days after it receives any case for adjudication, including impeachment cases.If the respondent has already left office before the pronouncement of the decision, the case is dismissed.\n\nThe last president to be subject to impeachment was Roh Moo-hyun, who was impeached by the National Assembly in 2004 and was suspended from duties for two months.In that case, the Constitutional Court of Korea acquitted Roh and restored him to power, with the South Korean public by and large in support of Roh.\n\nRevelations emerged in late October 2016, that President Park Geun-hye\'s aide, Choi Soon-sil, who did not have an official position in the government, had used her position to seek donations of money from several business conglomerates (known as chaebol), including Samsung, Hyundai, SK Group and Lotte, to two foundations she controlled.These revelations were first revealed when Park\'s unofficial clothier Ko Young-tae revealed evidence to the media of the nature of Park and Choi\'s relationship which suggested Choi\'s access to Park\'s personal and work life, and Choi was said to have directly influenced, and interfered with the policies of the Park government and to have edited Park\'s presidential speeches.Media investigations also reported that Choi and President Park\'s senior staff members, including both Ahn Jong-bum and Jeong Ho-sung, have allegedly used their influence to extort ₩77.4 billion ($60 million) from Korean chaebols—family-owned large business conglomerates—and set up two culture- and sports-related foundations, Mir and K-sports foundations.\n\nOn 25 October 2016, Park apologized to the nation in a televised address from the Blue House for giving Choi access to draft speeches during the first months of her presidency.Protests began on 26 October calling on President Park\'s resignation.Three days later, she dismissed her top aides including chief of staff Kim Ki-choon and two members of the cabinet and attempted to replace prime minister Hwang Kyo-ahn with Kim Byong-joon, a former aide to former president Roh Moo-hyun, but this was rejected by the National Assembly.\n\nOn 31 October, Choi Soon-sil was arrested by prosecutors, having concluded that there was enough evidence for an indictment.She was formally charged with abuse of power and fraud on 20 November.\n\nPark made a second apology on 4 November, pledging to take responsibility if she was found guilty, and a third apology on 29 November, calling for the National Assembly to decide the manner of her departure, but this was rejected by the opposition-controlled legislature.Protests across South Korea began on 26 October with Park\'s approval rating dropping to 4%, and according to an opinion poll, as of 9 December 78% of South Koreans supported her impeachment.President Park appointed Park Young-soo, former head of the Seoul High Prosecutors\' Office, as a special prosecutor to investigate the allegations on 30 November.\n\nChoi\'s daughter Chung Yoo-ra was also sought by prosecutors as a key witness.When she did not return to Korea for the investigation, an Interpol warrant was put out for her arrest.She was arrested in Denmark on 1 January 2017, and extradited to Korea in May.In late 2016 and early 2017, the German Federal Police began investigating Choi and Chung for money laundering.\n\nThe response to the Sewol ferry sinking accident that occurred on 16 April 2014 also contributed to Park\'s declining presidential ratings.\n\nOn 3 December 2016, at 4:10 am, Woo Sang-ho of the Democratic Party, Park Jie-won of the People\'s Party, and Roh Hoe-chan of the Justice Party moved the ""President (Park Geun-hye) impeachment proposal"" in the National Assembly on behalf of 171 members of their respective parties and other independent representatives, on the grounds that Geun-hye had violated the Constitution and the law.Park\'s Saenuri Party initially preferred Park to voluntarily step down in late April, but with mounting protests, the ruling party became divided on whether Park should step down voluntarily or be impeached.On 4 December, members of Saenuri\'s ""non-mainstream"" factions declared that they would vote in favour of Park\'s impeachment.\n\nThe 300-member National Assembly was scheduled to vote on an impeachment bill on 9 December, at the end of the legislative session.As impeachment against president requires a two-thirds supermajority, at least 200 members would have to vote to impeach, in which case Park would be impeached and immediately suspended from her office.There were up to 172 opposition and independent lawmakers, which meant at least 28 of the 128 MPs from the ruling Saenuri Party needed to cross the floor and join the opposition in supporting the impeachment measure for the vote to pass.\n\nOn 8 December, the South Korean National Assembly announced that the vote on the motion to impeach would take place on 9 December, at 3:00 pm local time.The opposition parties pledged to resign their seats in the National Assembly if the impeachment motion failed to pass.On 9 December, the National Assembly approved the impeachment motion by a vote of 234 in favour and 56 against in a secret ballot.The Speaker of the National Assembly (who happens to be unaffiliated with any party) abstained from the vote.Two other MPs abstained from voting and seven votes were declared invalid.\n\nAs a result of the motion\'s passage, President Park\'s powers and duties were suspended for up to 180 days while the Constitutional Court of Korea considered the validity of the impeachment motion.It was necessary for six of the nine judges on that court to agree with the impeachment for the removal to take effect.\n\nPresident Park held a final cabinet meeting acknowledging the impeachment motion and apologised for causing uncertainty, before Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn assumed presidential powers and duties at 19:30 Korean Standard Time, on an interim basis.\n\nProtesters congregated outside the National Assembly hall where the voting session was held.Some 40 family members of the victims of the sinking of MV Sewol looked on as lawmakers cast their secret ballots.Citizens who have been rallying in massive numbers against Park rejoiced at the news, while Park\'s supporters called the parliamentary impeachment a ""witch-hunt"" without concrete evidence of Park\'s wrongdoings.\n\nOn 1 January 2017, Park appeared in public for the first time since the impeachment before a select group of reporters at the Blue House, saying she denied any allegations of the scandal and wrongdoings.\n\nThe South Korean Constitutional Court had up to 180 days (until early June 2017) to decide on the issue.It held public hearings to hear from both sides on whether the National Assembly had followed due process and the impeachment was justified.\n\nThe Constitutional Court has been considered generally conservative, as all nine judges of the Constitutional Court were appointed during the conservative Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye administrations.The Constitutional Court was to start the Preparatory Hearing on 22 December, with initial views from both sides.\n\nThe first impeachment trial focused on the whereabouts of Park Geun-hye seven hours after the Sewol ferry sinking.The administration\'s delayed response to the disaster led to widespread criticism in South Korea and forced Park to deny various rumours.Then, on 23 December the Justice Ministry of South Korea said that it has submitted its views on the recent parliamentary vote to impeach President Park Geun-hye to the Constitutional Court, adding that the process has met all the necessary legal requirements.\n\nThe Constitutional Court was to officially start the main hearings on Tuesday, 3 January 2017, and Park would not be required to appear for questioning.Park was absent at the first open hearing and the first session was closed after just nine minutes.The hearings were rescheduled to start on 5 January 2017.The trial heard arguments and evidence until 27 February.\n\nOn 6 March, special prosecutor Park Young-soo announced the results of his probe into the Choi and Park allegations, finding evidence of collusion between Park and Choi to solicit bribes from Samsung Group and blacklisting more than 9,000 artists, authors, and movie industry professionals from government assistance that constituted an abuse of power.This opened the possibility of Park\'s indictment if the Constitutional Court upheld the National Assembly\'s impeachment motion.\n\nOn 10 March 2017, 11.00 am KST, the Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment in a unanimous 8–0 decision read out by Acting Chief Justice Lee Jung Mi, formally ending Park\'s presidency.This marked the first time that a sitting president was removed from the office since the creation of the Sixth Republic of South Korea after the country\'s democratization in 1987.Both supporters and opponents of Park had gathered outside the Constitutional Court building for the verdict.Three died and dozens were injured as a result of the ensuing clashes between her supporters and police.\n\nAs a result of impeachment, Park was stripped of her post-presidential benefits such as retirement pension, free medical services, state funding for her post-retirement office, personal assistants and a chauffeur, and right to burial at the Seoul National Cemetery after death.However, she is entitled to retain security protection under the Presidential Security Act.\n\nPark left the Blue House on the evening of 11 March and was welcomed to her home by supporters.She was arrested and placed into custody after an indictment by prosecutors on charges of bribery, abuse of power, coercion, and leaking government secrets on 31 March.\n\nAfter Park\'s removal from office, Prime Minister Hwang remained as Acting President.A presidential election was already scheduled for December 2017.However, it was advanced to 9 May 2017, as the constitution requires new elections within 60 days of a permanent presidential vacancy.In that election, Moon Jae-in was elected as the 12th president of South Korea.\n\nIn July 2018, it emerged that the Defense Security Command made plans for declaring martial law and authority to use military force to crackdown on protesters, if the Constitutional Court did not uphold Park\'s removal from office.The DSC had planned to mobilize 200 tanks, 550 armoured vehicles, 4,800 armed personnel, and 1,400 members of special forces in Seoul in order to enforce martial law.Other components of the plan included monitoring and censoring media content and arresting politicians taking part in protests.\n\nOn 6 April 2018, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison, after being found guilty of abuse of power and coercion.This was later raised to 25 years and a fine of ₩20 billion (US$17.86 million) following an appeal by prosecutors.She was

South Korea began on 26 October with Park\'s approval rating dropping to 4%, and according to an opinion poll, as of 9 December 78% of South Koreans supported her impeachment.President Park appointed Park Young-soo, former head of the Seoul High Prosecutors\' Office, as a special prosecutor to investigate the allegations on 30 November.\n\nChoi\'s daughter Chung Yoo-ra was also sought by prosecutors as a key witness.When she did not return to Korea for the investigation, an Interpol warrant was put out for her arrest.She was arrested in Denmark on 1 January 2017, and extradited to Korea in May.In late 2016 and early 2017, the German Federal Police began investigating Choi and Chung for money laundering.\n\nThe response to the Sewol ferry sinking accident that occurred on 16 April 2014 also contributed to Park\'s declining presidential ratings.\n\nOn 3 December 2016, at 4:10 am, Woo Sang-ho of the Democratic Party, Park Jie-won of the People\'s Party, and Roh Hoe-chan of the Justice Party moved the ""President (Park Geun-hye) impeachment proposal"" in the National Assembly on behalf of 171 members of their respective parties and other independent representatives, on the grounds that Geun-hye had violated the Constitution and the law.Park\'s Saenuri Party initially preferred Park to voluntarily step down in late April, but with mounting protests, the ruling party became divided on whether Park should step down voluntarily or be impeached.On 4 December, members of Saenuri\'s ""non-mainstream"" factions declared that they would vote in favour of Park\'s impeachment.\n\nThe 300-member National Assembly was scheduled to vote on an impeachment bill on 9 December, at the end of the legislative session.As impeachment against president requires a two-thirds supermajority, at least 200 members would have to vote to impeach, in which case Park would be impeached and immediately suspended from her office.There were up to 172 opposition and independent lawmakers, which meant at least 28 of the 128 MPs from the ruling Saenuri Party needed to cross the floor and join the opposition in supporting the impeachment measure for the vote to pass.\n\nOn 8 December, the South Korean National Assembly announced that the vote on the motion to impeach would take place on 9 December, at 3:00 pm local time.The opposition parties pledged to resign their seats in the National Assembly if the impeachment motion failed to pass.On 9 December, the National Assembly approved the impeachment motion by a vote of 234 in favour and 56 against in a secret ballot.The Speaker of the National Assembly (who happens to be unaffiliated with any party) abstained from the vote.Two other MPs abstained from voting and seven votes were declared invalid.\n\nAs a result of the motion\'s passage, President Park\'s powers and duties were suspended for up to 180 days while the Constitutional Court of Korea considered the validity of the impeachment motion.It was necessary for six of the nine judges on that court to agree with the impeachment for the removal to take effect.\n\nPresident Park held a final cabinet meeting acknowledging the impeachment motion and apologised for causing uncertainty, before Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn assumed presidential powers and duties at 19:30 Korean Standard Time, on an interim basis.\n\nProtesters congregated outside the National Assembly hall where the voting session was held.Some 40 family members of the victims of the sinking of MV Sewol looked on as lawmakers cast their secret ballots.Citizens who have been rallying in massive numbers against Park rejoiced at the news, while Park\'s supporters called the parliamentary impeachment a ""witch-hunt"" without concrete evidence of Park\'s wrongdoings.\n\nOn 1 January 2017, Park appeared in public for the first time since the impeachment before a select group of reporters at the Blue House, saying she denied any allegations of the scandal and wrongdoings.\n\nThe South Korean Constitutional Court had up to 180 days (until early June 2017) to decide on the issue.It held public hearings to hear from both sides on whether the National Assembly had followed due process and the impeachment was justified.\n\nThe Constitutional Court has been considered generally conservative, as all nine judges of the Constitutional Court were appointed during the conservative Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye administrations.The Constitutional Court was to start the Preparatory Hearing on 22 December, with initial views from both sides.\n\nThe first impeachment trial focused on the whereabouts of Park Geun-hye seven hours after the Sewol ferry sinking.The administration\'s delayed response to the disaster led to widespread criticism in South Korea and forced Park to deny various rumours.Then, on 23 December the Justice Ministry of South Korea said that it has submitted its views on the recent parliamentary vote to impeach President Park Geun-hye to the Constitutional Court, adding that the process has met all the necessary legal requirements.\n\nThe Constitutional Court was to officially start the main hearings on Tuesday, 3 January 2017, and Park would not be required to appear for questioning.Park was absent at the first open hearing and the first session was closed after just nine minutes.The hearings were rescheduled to start on 5 January 2017.The trial heard arguments and evidence until 27 February.\n\nOn 6 March, special prosecutor Park Young-soo announced the results of his probe into the Choi and Park allegations, finding evidence of collusion between Park and Choi to solicit bribes from Samsung Group and blacklisting more than 9,000 artists, authors, and movie industry professionals from government assistance that constituted an abuse of power.This opened the possibility of Park\'s indictment if the Constitutional Court upheld the National Assembly\'s impeachment motion.\n\nOn 10 March 2017, 11.00 am KST, the Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment in a unanimous 8–0 decision read out by Acting Chief Justice Lee Jung Mi, formally ending Park\'s presidency.This marked the first time that a sitting president was removed from the office since the creation of the Sixth Republic of South Korea after the country\'s democratization in 1987.Both supporters and opponents of Park had gathered outside the Constitutional Court building for the verdict.Three died and dozens were injured as a result of the ensuing clashes between her supporters and police.\n\nAs a result of impeachment, Park was stripped of her post-presidential benefits such as retirement pension, free medical services, state funding for her post-retirement office, personal assistants and a chauffeur, and right to burial at the Seoul National Cemetery after death.However, she is entitled to retain security protection under the Presidential Security Act.\n\nPark left the Blue House on the evening of 11 March and was welcomed to her home by supporters.She was arrested and placed into custody after an indictment by prosecutors on charges of bribery, abuse of power, coercion, and leaking government secrets on 31 March.\n\nAfter Park\'s removal from office, Prime Minister Hwang remained as Acting President.A presidential election was already scheduled for December 2017.However, it was advanced to 9 May 2017, as the constitution requires new elections within 60 days of a permanent presidential vacancy.In that election, Moon Jae-in was elected as the 12th president of South Korea.\n\nIn July 2018, it emerged that the Defense Security Command made plans for declaring martial law and authority to use military force to crackdown on protesters, if the Constitutional Court did not uphold Park\'s removal from office.The DSC had planned to mobilize 200 tanks, 550 armoured vehicles, 4,800 armed personnel, and 1,400 members of special forces in Seoul in order to enforce martial law.Other components of the plan included monitoring and censoring media content and arresting politicians taking part in protests.\n\nOn 6 April 2018, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison, after being found guilty of abuse of power and coercion.This was later raised to 25 years and a fine of ₩20 billion (US$17.86 million) following an appeal by prosecutors.She was

78,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Impeachment of Park Geun-hye', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The impeachment of Park Geun-hye, President of South Korea, was the culmination of a political scandal involving interventions to the presidency from her aide, Choi Soon-sil.The impeachment vote took place on 9 December 2016, with 234 members of the 300-member National Assembly voting in favour of the impeachment and temporary suspension of Park Geun-hye\'s presidential powers and duties.This exceeded the required two-thirds threshold in the National Assembly and, although the vote was by secret ballot, the results indicated that more than half of the 128 lawmakers in Park\'s party Saenuri had supported her impeachment.Thus, Hwang Kyo-ahn, then Prime Minister of South Korea, became Acting President while the Constitutional Court of Korea was due to determine whether to accept the impeachment.The court upheld the impeachment in a unanimous 8–0 decision on 10 March 2017, removing Park from office.The regularly scheduled presidential election was advanced to 9 May 2017, and Moon Jae-in, former leader of the Democratic Party, was elected as Park\'s permanent successor.\n\nPark was formally sentenced to 24 years in prison on 6 April 2018 after being found guilty of abuse of power and coercion.This was later raised to 25 years and a fine of ₩20 billion (US$17.86 million) following an appeal by prosecutors.President Moon would go on to pardon Park Geun-hye on compassionate grounds in December 2021.She was ultimately released and later returned home in March 2022.\n\nThe procedure for impeachment is set out in the 10th Constitution of South Korea in 1987.According to Article 65 Clause 1, if the President, Prime Minister, or other state council members violate the Constitution or other laws of official duty, the National Assembly can impeach them.\n\nClause 2 states the impeachment bill must be proposed by one third, and approved by a majority of members of the National Assembly for passage.In the case of the President, the motion must be proposed by a majority and approved by two thirds or more of the total members of the National Assembly, meaning that 200 of 300 members of the parliament must vote to approve the bill.This article also states that any person against whom a motion for impeachment has been passed shall be suspended from exercising his/her power until the impeachment has been adjudicated, and a decision on impeachment shall not extend further than removal from public office.However, impeachment shall not exempt the person impeached from civil or criminal liability for such violations.\n\nBy the Constitutional Court Act of 1988, the Constitutional Court must make a final decision within 180 days after it receives any case for adjudication, including impeachment cases.If the respondent has already left office before the pronouncement of the decision, the case is dismissed.\n\nThe last president to be subject to impeachment was Roh Moo-hyun, who was impeached by the National Assembly in 2004 and was suspended from duties for two months.In that case, the Constitutional Court of Korea acquitted Roh and restored him to power, with the South Korean public by and large in support of Roh.\n\nRevelations emerged in late October 2016, that President Park Geun-hye\'s aide, Choi Soon-sil, who did not have an official position in the government, had used her position to seek donations of money from several business conglomerates (known as chaebol), including Samsung, Hyundai, SK Group and Lotte, to two foundations she controlled.These revelations were first revealed when Park\'s unofficial clothier Ko Young-tae revealed evidence to the media of the nature of Park and Choi\'s relationship which suggested Choi\'s access to Park\'s personal and work life, and Choi was said to have directly influenced, and interfered with the policies of the Park government and to have edited Park\'s presidential speeches.Media investigations also reported that Choi and President Park\'s senior staff members, including both Ahn Jong-bum and Jeong Ho-sung, have allegedly used their influence to extort ₩77.4 billion ($60 million) from Korean chaebols—family-owned large business conglomerates—and set up two culture- and sports-related foundations, Mir and K-sports foundations.\n\nOn 25 October 2016, Park apologized to the nation in a televised address from the Blue House for giving Choi access to draft speeches during the first months of her presidency.Protests began on 26 October calling on President Park\'s resignation.Three days later, she dismissed her top aides including chief of staff Kim Ki-choon and two members of the cabinet and attempted to replace prime minister Hwang Kyo-ahn with Kim Byong-joon, a former aide to former president Roh Moo-hyun, but this was rejected by the National Assembly.\n\nOn 31 October, Choi Soon-sil was arrested by prosecutors, having concluded that there was enough evidence for an indictment.She was formally charged with abuse of power and fraud on 20 November.\n\nPark made a second apology on 4 November, pledging to take responsibility if she was found

Constitutional Court were appointed during the conservative Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye administrations.The Constitutional Court was to start the Preparatory Hearing on 22 December, with initial views from both sides.\n\nThe first impeachment trial focused on the whereabouts of Park Geun-hye seven hours after the Sewol ferry sinking.The administration\'s delayed response to the disaster led to widespread criticism in South Korea and forced Park to deny various rumours.Then, on 23 December the Justice Ministry of South Korea said that it has submitted its views on the recent parliamentary vote to impeach President Park Geun-hye to the Constitutional Court, adding that the process has met all the necessary legal requirements.\n\nThe Constitutional Court was to officially start the main hearings on Tuesday, 3 January 2017, and Park would not be required to appear for questioning.Park was absent at the first open hearing and the first session was closed after just nine minutes.The hearings were rescheduled to start on 5 January 2017.The trial heard arguments and evidence until 27 February.\n\nOn 6 March, special prosecutor Park Young-soo announced the results of his probe into the Choi and Park allegations, finding evidence of collusion between Park and Choi to solicit bribes from Samsung Group and blacklisting more than 9,000 artists, authors, and movie industry professionals from government assistance that constituted an abuse of power.This opened the possibility of Park\'s indictment if the Constitutional Court upheld the National Assembly\'s impeachment motion.\n\nOn 10 March 2017, 11.00 am KST, the Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment in a unanimous 8–0 decision read out by Acting Chief Justice Lee Jung Mi, formally ending Park\'s presidency.This marked the first time that a sitting president was removed from the office since the creation of the Sixth Republic of South Korea after the country\'s democratization in 1987.Both supporters and opponents of Park had gathered outside the Constitutional Court building for the verdict.Three died and dozens were injured as a result of the ensuing clashes between her supporters and police.\n\nAs a result of impeachment, Park was stripped of her post-presidential benefits such as retirement pension, free medical services, state funding for her post-retirement office, personal assistants and a chauffeur, and right to burial at the Seoul National Cemetery after death.However, she is entitled to retain security protection under the Presidential Security Act.\n\nPark left the Blue House on the evening of 11 March and was welcomed to her home by supporters.She was arrested and placed into custody after an indictment by prosecutors on charges of bribery, abuse of power, coercion, and leaking government secrets on 31 March.\n\nAfter Park\'s removal from office, Prime Minister Hwang remained as Acting President.A presidential election was already scheduled for December 2017.However, it was advanced to 9 May 2017, as the constitution requires new elections within 60 days of a permanent presidential vacancy.In that election, Moon Jae-in was elected as the 12th president of South Korea.\n\nIn July 2018, it emerged that the Defense Security Command made plans for declaring martial law and authority to use military force to crackdown on protesters, if the Constitutional Court did not uphold Park\'s removal from office.The DSC had planned to mobilize 200 tanks, 550 armoured vehicles, 4,800 armed personnel, and 1,400 members of special forces in Seoul in order to enforce martial law.Other components of the plan included monitoring and censoring media content and arresting politicians taking part in protests.\n\nOn 6 April 2018, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison, after being found guilty of abuse of power and coercion.This was later raised to 25 years and a fine of ₩20 billion (US$17.86 million) following an appeal by prosecutors.She was

80,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Impeachment of Park Geun-hye', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The impeachment of Park Geun-hye, President of South Korea, was the culmination of a political scandal involving interventions to the presidency from her aide, Choi Soon-sil.The impeachment vote took place on 9 December 2016, with 234 members of the 300-member National Assembly voting in favour of the impeachment and temporary suspension of Park Geun-hye\'s presidential powers and duties.This exceeded the required two-thirds threshold in the National Assembly and, although the vote was by secret ballot, the results indicated that more than half of the 128 lawmakers in Park\'s party Saenuri had supported her impeachment.Thus, Hwang Kyo-ahn, then Prime Minister of South Korea, became Acting President while the Constitutional Court of Korea was due to determine whether to accept the impeachment.The court upheld the impeachment in a unanimous 8–0 decision on 10 March 2017, removing Park from office.The regularly scheduled presidential election was advanced to 9 May 2017, and Moon Jae-in, former leader of the Democratic Party, was elected as Park\'s permanent successor.\n\nPark was formally sentenced to 24 years in prison on 6 April 2018 after being found guilty of abuse of power and coercion.This was later raised to 25 years and a fine of ₩20 billion (US$17.86 million) following an appeal by prosecutors.President Moon would go on to pardon Park Geun-hye on compassionate grounds in December 2021.She was ultimately released and later returned home in March 2022.\n\nThe procedure for impeachment is set out in the 10th Constitution of South Korea in 1987.According to Article 65 Clause 1, if the President, Prime Minister, or other state council members violate the Constitution or other laws of official duty, the National Assembly can impeach them.\n\nClause 2 states the impeachment bill must be proposed by one third, and approved by a majority of members of the National Assembly for passage.In the case of the President, the motion must be proposed by a majority and approved by two thirds or more of the total members of the National Assembly, meaning that 200 of 300 members of the parliament must vote to approve the bill.This article also states that any person against whom a motion for impeachment has been passed shall be suspended from exercising his/her power until the impeachment has been adjudicated, and a decision on impeachment shall not extend further than removal from public office.However, impeachment shall not exempt the person impeached from civil or criminal liability for such violations.\n\nBy the Constitutional Court Act of 1988, the Constitutional Court must make a final decision within 180 days after it receives any case for adjudication, including impeachment cases.If the respondent has already left office before the pronouncement of the decision, the case is dismissed.\n\nThe last president to be subject to impeachment was Roh Moo-hyun, who was impeached by the National Assembly in 2004 and was suspended from duties for two months.In that case, the Constitutional Court of Korea acquitted Roh and restored him to power, with the South Korean public by and large in support of Roh.\n\nRevelations emerged in late October 2016, that President Park Geun-hye\'s aide, Choi Soon-sil, who did not have an official position in the government, had used her position to seek donations of money from several business conglomerates (known as chaebol), including Samsung, Hyundai, SK Group and Lotte, to two foundations she controlled.These revelations were first revealed when Park\'s unofficial clothier Ko Young-tae revealed evidence to the media of the nature of Park and Choi\'s relationship which suggested Choi\'s access to Park\'s personal and work life, and Choi was said to have directly influenced, and interfered with the policies of the Park government and to have edited Park\'s presidential speeches.Media investigations also reported that Choi and President Park\'s senior staff members, including both Ahn Jong-bum and Jeong Ho-sung, have allegedly used their influence to extort ₩77.4 billion ($60 million) from Korean chaebols—family-owned large business conglomerates—and set up two culture- and sports-related foundations, Mir and K-sports foundations.\n\nOn 25 October 2016, Park apologized to the nation in a televised address from the Blue House for giving Choi access to draft speeches during the first months of her presidency.Protests began on 26 October calling on President Park\'s resignation.Three days later, she dismissed her top aides including chief of staff Kim Ki-choon and two members of the cabinet and attempted to replace prime minister Hwang Kyo-ahn with Kim Byong-joon, a former aide to former president Roh Moo-hyun, but this was rejected by the National Assembly.\n\nOn 31 October, Choi Soon-sil was arrested by prosecutors, having concluded that there was enough evidence for an indictment.She was formally charged with abuse of power and fraud on 20 November.\n\nPark made a second apology on 4 November, pledging to take responsibility if she was found guilty, and a third apology on 29 November, calling for the National Assembly to decide the manner of her departure, but this was rejected by the opposition-controlled legislature.Protests across South Korea began on 26 October with Park\'s approval rating dropping to 4%, and according to an opinion poll, as of 9 December 78% of South Koreans supported her impeachment.President Park appointed Park Young-soo, former head of the Seoul High Prosecutors\' Office, as a special prosecutor to investigate the allegations on 30 November.\n\nChoi\'s daughter Chung Yoo-ra was also sought by prosecutors as a key witness.When she did not return to Korea for the investigation, an Interpol warrant was put out for her arrest.She was arrested in Denmark on 1 January 2017, and extradited to Korea in May.In late 2016 and early 2017, the German Federal Police began investigating Choi and Chung for money laundering.\n\nThe response to the Sewol ferry sinking accident that occurred on 16 April 2014 also contributed to Park\'s declining presidential ratings.\n\nOn 3 December 2016, at 4:10 am, Woo Sang-ho of the Democratic Party, Park Jie-won of the People\'s Party, and Roh Hoe-chan of the Justice Party moved the ""President (Park Geun-hye) impeachment proposal"" in the National Assembly on behalf of 171 members of their respective parties and other independent representatives, on the grounds that Geun-hye had violated the Constitution and the law.Park\'s Saenuri Party initially preferred Park to voluntarily step down in late April, but with mounting protests, the ruling party became divided on whether Park should step down voluntarily or be impeached.On 4 December, members of Saenuri\'s ""non-mainstream"" factions declared that they would vote in favour of Park\'s impeachment.\n\nThe 300-member National Assembly was scheduled to vote on an impeachment bill on 9 December, at the end of the legislative session.As impeachment against president requires a two-thirds supermajority, at least 200 members would have to vote to impeach, in which case Park would be impeached and immediately suspended from her office.There were up to 172 opposition and independent lawmakers, which meant at least 28 of the 128 MPs from the ruling Saenuri Party needed to cross the floor and join the opposition in supporting the impeachment measure for the vote to pass.\n\nOn 8 December, the South Korean National Assembly announced that the vote on the motion to impeach would take place on 9 December, at 3:00 pm local time.The opposition parties pledged to resign their seats in the National Assembly if the impeachment motion failed to pass.On 9 December, the National Assembly approved the impeachment motion by a vote of 234 in favour and 56 against in a secret ballot.The Speaker of the National Assembly (who happens to be unaffiliated with any party) abstained from the vote.Two other MPs abstained from voting and seven votes were declared invalid.\n\nAs a result of the motion\'s passage, President Park\'s powers and duties were suspended for up to 180 days while the Constitutional Court of Korea considered the validity of the impeachment motion.It was necessary for six of the nine judges on that court to agree with the impeachment for the removal to take effect.\n\nPresident Park held a final cabinet meeting acknowledging the impeachment motion and apologised for causing uncertainty, before Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn assumed presidential powers and duties at 19:30 Korean Standard Time, on an interim basis.\n\nProtesters congregated outside the National Assembly hall where the voting session was held.Some 40 family members of the victims of the sinking of MV Sewol looked on as lawmakers cast their secret ballots.Citizens who have been rallying in massive numbers against Park rejoiced at the news, while Park\'s supporters called the parliamentary impeachment a ""witch-hunt"" without concrete evidence of Park\'s wrongdoings.\n\nOn 1 January 2017, Park appeared in public for the first time since the impeachment before a select group of reporters at the Blue House, saying she denied any allegations of the scandal and wrongdoings.\n\nThe South Korean Constitutional Court had up to 180 days (until early June 2017) to decide on the issue.It held public hearings to hear from both sides

82,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Impeachment of Park Geun-hye', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'The impeachment of Park Geun-hye, President of South Korea, was the culmination of a political scandal involving interventions to the presidency from her aide, Choi Soon-sil.The impeachment vote took place on 9 December 2016, with 234 members of the 300-member National Assembly voting in favour of the impeachment and temporary suspension of Park Geun-hye\'s presidential powers and duties.This exceeded the required two-thirds threshold in the National Assembly and, although the vote was by secret ballot, the results indicated that more than half of the 128 lawmakers in Park\'s party Saenuri had supported her impeachment.Thus, Hwang Kyo-ahn, then Prime Minister of South Korea, became Acting President while the Constitutional Court of Korea was due to determine whether to accept the impeachment.The court upheld the impeachment in a unanimous 8–0 decision on 10 March 2017, removing Park from office.The regularly scheduled presidential election was advanced to 9 May 2017, and Moon Jae-in, former leader of the Democratic Party, was elected as Park\'s permanent successor.\n\nPark was formally sentenced to 24 years in prison on 6 April 2018 after being found guilty of abuse of power and coercion.This was later raised to 25 years and a fine of ₩20 billion (US$17.86 million) following an appeal by prosecutors.President Moon would go on to pardon Park Geun-hye on compassionate grounds in December 2021.She was ultimately released and later returned home in March 2022.\n\nThe procedure for impeachment is set out in the 10th Constitution of South Korea in 1987.According to Article 65 Clause 1, if the President, Prime Minister, or other state council members violate the Constitution or other laws of official duty, the National Assembly can impeach them.\n\nClause 2 states the impeachment bill must be proposed by one third, and approved by a majority of members of the National Assembly for passage.In the case of the President, the motion must be proposed by a majority and approved by two thirds or more of the total members of the National Assembly, meaning that 200 of 300 members of the parliament must vote to approve the bill.This article also states that any person against whom a motion for impeachment has been passed shall be suspended from exercising his/her power until the impeachment has been adjudicated, and a decision on impeachment shall not extend further than removal from public office.However, impeachment shall not exempt the person impeached from civil or criminal liability for such violations.\n\nBy the Constitutional Court Act of 1988, the Constitutional Court must make a final decision within 180 days after it receives any case for adjudication, including impeachment cases.If the respondent has already left office before the pronouncement of the decision, the case is dismissed.\n\nThe last president to be subject to impeachment was Roh Moo-hyun, who was impeached by the National Assembly in 2004 and was suspended from duties for two months.In that case, the Constitutional Court of Korea acquitted Roh and restored him to power, with the South Korean public by and large in support of Roh.\n\nRevelations emerged in late October 2016, that President Park Geun-hye\'s aide, Choi Soon-sil, who did not have an official position in the government, had used her position to seek donations of money from several business conglomerates (known as chaebol), including Samsung, Hyundai, SK Group and Lotte, to two foundations she controlled.These revelations were first revealed when Park\'s unofficial clothier Ko Young-tae revealed evidence to the media of the nature of Park and Choi\'s relationship which suggested Choi\'s access to Park\'s personal and work life, and Choi was said to have directly influenced, and interfered with the policies of the Park government and to have edited Park\'s presidential speeches.Media investigations also reported that Choi and President Park\'s senior staff members, including both Ahn Jong-bum and Jeong Ho-sung, have allegedly used their influence to extort ₩77.4 billion ($60 million) from Korean chaebols—family-owned large business conglomerates—and set up two culture- and sports-related foundations, Mir and K-sports foundations.\n\nOn 25 October 2016, Park apologized to the nation in a televised address from the Blue House for giving Choi access to draft speeches during the first months of her presidency.Protests began on 26 October calling on President Park\'s resignation.Three days later, she dismissed her top aides including chief of staff Kim Ki-choon and two members of the cabinet and attempted to replace prime minister Hwang Kyo-ahn with Kim Byong-joon, a former aide to former president Roh Moo-hyun, but this was rejected by the National Assembly.\n\nOn 31 October, Choi Soon-sil was arrested by prosecutors, having concluded that there was enough evidence for an indictment.She was formally charged with abuse of power and fraud on 20 November.\n\nPark made a second apology on 4 November, pledging to take responsibility if she was found guilty, and a third apology on 29 November, calling for the National Assembly to decide the manner of her departure, but this was rejected by the opposition-controlled legislature.Protests across South Korea began on 26 October with Park\'s approval rating dropping to 4%, and according to an opinion poll, as of 9 December 78% of South Koreans supported her impeachment.President Park appointed Park Young-soo, former head of the Seoul High Prosecutors\' Office, as a special prosecutor to investigate the allegations on 30 November.\n\nChoi\'s daughter Chung Yoo-ra was also sought by prosecutors as a key witness.When she did not return to Korea for the investigation, an Interpol warrant was put out for her arrest.She was arrested in Denmark on 1 January 2017, and extradited to Korea in May.In late 2016 and early 2017, the German Federal Police began investigating Choi and Chung for money laundering.\n\nThe response to the Sewol ferry sinking accident that occurred on 16 April 2014 also contributed to Park\'s declining presidential ratings.\n\nOn 3 December 2016, at 4:10 am, Woo Sang-ho of the Democratic Party, Park Jie-won of the People\'s Party, and Roh Hoe-chan of the Justice Party moved the ""President (Park Geun-hye) impeachment proposal"" in the National Assembly on behalf of 171 members of their respective parties and other independent representatives, on the grounds that Geun-hye had violated the Constitution and the law.Park\'s Saenuri Party initially preferred Park to voluntarily step down in late April, but with mounting protests, the ruling party became divided on whether Park should step down voluntarily or be impeached.On 4 December, members of Saenuri\'s ""non-mainstream"" factions declared that they would vote in favour of Park\'s impeachment.\n\nThe 300-member National Assembly was scheduled to vote on an impeachment bill on 9 December, at the end of the legislative session.As impeachment against president requires a two-thirds supermajority, at least 200 members would have to vote to impeach, in which case Park would be impeached and immediately suspended from her office.There were up to 172 opposition and independent lawmakers, which meant at least 28 of the 128 MPs from the ruling Saenuri Party needed to cross the floor and join the opposition in supporting the impeachment measure for the vote to pass.\n\nOn 8 December, the South Korean National Assembly announced that the vote on the motion to impeach would take place on 9 December, at 3:00 pm local time.The opposition parties pledged to resign their seats in the National Assembly if the impeachment motion failed to pass.On 9 December, the National Assembly approved the impeachment motion by a vote of 234 in favour and 56 against in a secret ballot.The Speaker of the National Assembly (who happens to be unaffiliated with any party) abstained from the vote.Two other MPs abstained from voting and seven votes were declared invalid.\n\nAs a result of the motion\'s passage, President Park\'s powers and duties were suspended for up to 180 days while the Constitutional Court of Korea considered the validity of the impeachment motion.It was necessary for six of the nine judges on that court to agree with the impeachment for the removal to take effect.\n\nPresident Park held a final cabinet meeting acknowledging the impeachment motion and apologised for causing uncertainty, before Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn assumed presidential powers and duties at 19:30 Korean Standard Time, on an interim basis.\n\nProtesters congregated outside the National Assembly hall where the voting session was held.Some 40 family members of the victims of the sinking of MV Sewol looked on as lawmakers cast their secret ballots.Citizens who have been rallying in massive numbers against Park rejoiced at the news, while Park\'s supporters called the parliamentary impeachment a ""witch-hunt"" without concrete evidence of Park\'s wrongdoings.\n\nOn 1 January 2017, Park appeared in public for the first time since the impeachment before a select group of reporters at the Blue House, saying she denied any allegations of the scandal and wrongdoings.\n\nThe South Korean Constitutional Court had up to 180 days (until early June 2017) to decide on the issue.It held public hearings to hear from both sides on whether the National Assembly had followed due process and the impeachment was justified.\n\nThe Constitutional Court has been considered generally conservative, as all nine judges of the Constitutional Court were appointed during the conservative Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye administrations.The Constitutional Court was to start the Preparatory Hearing on 22 December, with initial views from both sides.\n\nThe first impeachment trial focused on the whereabouts of Park Geun-hye seven hours after the Sewol ferry sinking.The administration\'s delayed response to the disaster led to widespread criticism in South Korea and forced Park to deny various rumours.Then, on 23 December the Justice Ministry of South Korea said that it has submitted its views on the recent parliamentary vote to impeach President Park Geun-hye to the Constitutional Court, adding that the process has met all the necessary legal requirements.\n\nThe Constitutional Court was to officially start the main hearings on Tuesday, 3 January 2017, and Park would not be required to appear for questioning.Park was absent at the first open hearing and the first session was closed after just nine minutes.The hearings were rescheduled to start on 5 January 2017.The trial heard arguments and evidence until 27 February.\n\nOn 6 March, special prosecutor Park Young-soo announced the results of his probe into the Choi and Park allegations, finding evidence of collusion between Park and Choi to solicit bribes from Samsung Group and blacklisting more than 9,000 artists, authors, and movie industry professionals from government assistance that constituted an abuse of power.This opened the possibility of Park\'s indictment if the Constitutional Court upheld the National Assembly\'s impeachment motion.\n\nOn 10 March 2017, 11.00 am KST, the Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment in a unanimous 8–0 decision read out by Acting Chief Justice Lee Jung Mi, formally ending Park\'s presidency.This marked the first time that a sitting president was removed from the office since the creation of the Sixth Republic of South Korea after the country\'s democratization in 1987.Both supporters and opponents of Park had gathered outside the Constitutional Court building for the verdict.Three died and dozens were injured as a result of the ensuing clashes between her supporters and police.\n\nAs a result of impeachment, Park was stripped of her post-presidential benefits such as retirement pension, free medical services, state funding for her post-retirement office, personal assistants and a chauffeur, and right to burial at the Seoul National Cemetery after death.However, she is entitled to retain security protection under the Presidential Security Act.\n\nPark left the Blue House on the evening of 11 March and was welcomed to her home by supporters.She was arrested and placed into custody after an indictment by prosecutors on charges of bribery, abuse of power, coercion, and leaking government secrets on 31 March.\n\nAfter Park\'s removal from office, Prime Minister Hwang remained as Acting President.A presidential election was already scheduled for December 2017.However, it was advanced to 9 May 2017, as the constitution requires new elections within 60 days of a permanent presidential vacancy.In that election, Moon Jae-in was elected as the 12th president of South Korea.\n\nIn July 2018, it emerged that the Defense Security Command made plans for declaring martial law and authority to use military force to crackdown on protesters, if the Constitutional Court did not uphold Park\'s removal from office.The DSC had planned to mobilize 200 tanks, 550 armoured vehicles, 4,800 armed personnel, and 1,400 members of special forces in Seoul in order to enforce martial law.Other components of the plan included monitoring and censoring media content and arresting politicians taking part in protests.\n\nOn 6 April 2018, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison, after being found guilty of abuse of power and coercion.This was later raised to 25 years and a fine of ₩20 billion (US$17.86 million) following an appeal by prosecutors.She was

Geun-hye.The elections were conducted in a single round, on a first-past-the-post basis, and had originally been scheduled for 20 December 2017.However, they were brought forward after the decision of the Constitutional Court on 10 March 2017 to uphold the National Assembly\'s impeachment of Park.Following procedures set out in the Constitution of South Korea, Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn succeeded Park as the acting president.After Park was removed from office by the Constitutional Court\'s ruling, acting president Hwang announced he would not run for a term in his own right.\n\nOpinion polling before April consistently placed the Democratic Party\'s candidate, Moon Jae-in, runner-up in the 2012 election, as the front-runner.Second place in the opinion polls was initially held by former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who declined to run in February, followed by Ahn Hee-jung, whilst he lost the Democratic primaries to Moon.Support for People Party founder Ahn Cheol-soo then surged, threatening Moon\'s lead in the polls throughout early April, before descending to approximately equal that of Liberty Korea Party\'s candidate, Hong Jun-pyo, in final polls.\n\nMoon won the election with 41 percent of the vote, defeating his nearest opponent, Hong, by a nearly 2-to-1 margin.Under the Constitution of South Korea, if a president dies, resigns, or is removed by impeachment, a new election must take place within 60 days.As a result, unlike previous presidential elections, president-elect Moon took office immediately upon the confirmation of the result by the National Election Commission, with the inauguration at the National Assembly on the same day.\n\nPark Geun-hye of the conservative Saenuri Party (renamed just prior to the election in February 2017 as the Liberty Korea Party) won the previous presidential election in 2012, succeeding Lee Myung-bak of the same party.\n\nThe Saenuri Party lost the parliamentary election in April 2016, with opposition parties including liberal Democratic Party of Korea and People Party winning a majority in the National Assembly.Commentators described the result as leaving Park a lame duck president, as she may not run again under South Korea\'s one-term presidency rule.and the Nikkei Asian Review noted that, in the wake of her ""crushing defeat"", ""rivals sense a prime opportunity to complete the power shift in the December

the Constitutional Court on 10 March 2017 to uphold the National Assembly\'s impeachment of Park.Following procedures set out in the Constitution of South Korea, Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn succeeded Park as the acting president.After Park was removed from office by the Constitutional Court\'s ruling, acting president Hwang announced he would not run for a term in his own right.\n\nOpinion polling

Geun-hye.The elections were conducted in a single round, on a first-past-the-post basis, and had originally been scheduled for 20 December 2017.However, they were brought forward after the decision of the Constitutional Court on 10 March 2017 to uphold the National Assembly\'s impeachment of Park.Following procedures set out in the Constitution of South Korea, Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn succeeded Park as the acting president.After Park was removed from office by the Constitutional Court\'s ruling, acting president Hwang announced he would not run for a term in his own right.\n\nOpinion polling before April consistently placed the Democratic Party\'s candidate, Moon Jae-in, runner-up in the 2012 election, as the front-runner.Second place in the opinion polls was initially held by former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who declined to run in February, followed by Ahn Hee-jung, whilst he lost the Democratic primaries to Moon.Support for People Party founder Ahn Cheol-soo then surged, threatening Moon\'s lead in the polls throughout early April, before descending to approximately equal that of Liberty Korea Party\'s candidate, Hong Jun-pyo, in final polls.\n\nMoon won the election with 41 percent of the vote, defeating his nearest opponent, Hong, by a nearly 2-to-1 margin.Under the Constitution of South Korea, if a president dies, resigns, or is removed by impeachment, a new election must take place within 60 days.As a result, unlike previous presidential elections, president-elect Moon took office immediately upon the confirmation of the result by the National Election Commission, with the inauguration at the National Assembly on the same day.\n\nPark Geun-hye of the conservative Saenuri Party (renamed just prior to the election in February 2017 as the Liberty Korea Party) won the previous presidential election in 2012, succeeding Lee Myung-bak of the same party.\n\nThe Saenuri Party lost the parliamentary election in April 2016, with opposition parties including liberal Democratic Party of Korea and People Party winning a majority in the National Assembly.Commentators described the result as leaving Park a lame duck president, as she may not run again under South Korea\'s one-term presidency rule.and the Nikkei Asian Review noted that, in the wake of her ""crushing defeat"", ""rivals sense a prime opportunity to complete the power shift in the December 2017 presidential vote"".The Korea Times stated: ""The drama of deals and power struggles for next year\'s election has already begun.""\n\nOn 9 December 2016, President Park was impeached by the National Assembly by a vote of 234 for and 56 against (with seven invalid votes and two abstentions) after her implication in the 2016 South Korean political scandal.The Constitutional Court reviewed the motion of impeachment.\n\nOn 10 March 2017, Park was formally removed from office, with a unanimous ruling by all eight of the Constitutional Court\'s justices supporting her impeachment.A presidential election would have to be held within 60 days.In the interim, Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn succeeded Park and served out the remainder of the 18th term until election day.\n\nThe presidential election had previously been scheduled for 20 December, with Park barred from running due to the constitutional ban on any sort of presidential reelection.However, with Park\'s removal from office, the elections were brought forward to 9 May in order to ensure that a new president would be able to take office within 60 days of Park\'s removal, as required by the Constitution.\n\nThe

101,"{'Wiki_Title': '2016 Turkish coup attempt', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'On 15 July 2016, a faction within the Turkish Armed Forces, organized as the Peace at Home Council, attempted a coup d\'état against state institutions, including the government and president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.They attempted to seize control of several places in Ankara, Istanbul, Marmaris and elsewhere, such as the Asian side entrance of the Bosphorus Bridge, but failed to do so after forces and civilians loyal to the state defeated them.The Council cited an erosion of secularism, elimination of democratic rule, disregard for human rights, and Turkey\'s loss of credibility in the international arena as reasons for the coup.The government said it had evidence the coup leaders were linked to the Gülen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the Republic of Turkey and led by Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish businessman and a well-known Islamic scholar who lives in exile in Pennsylvania.The Turkish government alleged that Gülen was behind the coup (which Gülen denied) and that the United States was harboring him.Events surrounding the coup attempt and the purges in its aftermath reflect a complex power struggle between Islamist elites in Turkey.\n\nDuring the coup attempt, over 300 people were killed and more than 2,100 were injured.Many government buildings, including the Turkish Parliament and the Presidential Palace, were bombed from the air.Mass arrests followed, with at least 40,000 detained, including at least 10,000 soldiers and 2,745 judges, for being affiliated with the coup attempt.15,000 education staff were also suspended and the licenses of 21,000 teachers working at private institutions were revoked after the government stated they were loyal to Gülen.More than 77,000 people have been arrested and over 160,000 fired from their jobs, on reports of connections to Gülen.\n\nThere were many reactions against the coup attempt, both domestically and internationally.The main opposition parties in Turkey condemned the attempt, while several international leaders—such as those of the United States, NATO, the European Union, and neighboring countries—called for ""respect of the democratic institutions in Turkey and its elected officials.""Many international organizations also opposed the coup.The United Nations Security Council, however, did not denounce the coup after disagreements over the phrasing of a statement.Iran opposed the coup and advised Erdogan to defeat the coup plotters.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the head of United States Central Command, General Joseph Votel, was ""siding with coup plotters"", after Votel criticized the Turkish government for arresting the Pentagon\'s contacts in Turkey.\n\nIn March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.The same month, the British Parliament\'s Foreign Affairs Select Committee said some Gulenists were involved in the coup d\'état attempt but found no hard evidence that Fethullah Gülen masterminded the failed coup and found no evidence to justify the United Kingdom designating the Gülen movement as a ""terrorist organization"".\n\nSince the 1970s, followers of the influential cleric Fethullah Gülen had assumed increasingly important positions within the Turkish state apparatus.Gülen several times advised his followers to take key positions in society and government, if necessary with a secret identity to avoid opposition from the laicistic Turkish army and government.Nevertheless, at the start of the 21st century, Gülen\'s followers achieved crucial positions of power in Turkey (and beyond) with a vast network of newspapers, TV channels, schools, associations, lobby organizations, financial institutions and positions within the state such as the army and the judiciary.Initially, the then Prime Minister Erdogan seemingly tolerated the power of the Gülen movement because of common interests such as limiting the undemocratic political power of the military, but also because of impotence and fear of Gülen\'s power within Turkey.\n\nA series of events eventually led to a rift between Erdogan and Gülen.For example, prosecutors that allegedly were aligned with the Gülen movement tried to arrest the intelligence chief Hakan Fidan for the peace negotiations with the PKK, and by extension PM Erdogan subsequently, as the Turkish secret service is directly subordinate to the prime minister of Turkey.During this period (2010-2013), state secrets were leaked, fraud was committed with the entrance exams for government employees (KPSS), a change of power occurred at the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) and (sex)tapes of both government members and opposition members were leaked.Following these events and other incidents, the Turkish government decided to designate the Gülen movement as parallel state and FETÖ (Fethullahist Terror Organization).Alleged Gülen supporters were fired or arrested.The coup attempt that followed is therefore also described by some analysts as a last desperate attempt by Gülenists to retain power.\n\nIt is widely reported that Kemalist ideology played a huge role in motivating the 15 July 2016 coup attempt, like all previous political interventions in the history of Turkey\'s military coups.Since the establishment of multiparty democracy in Turkey in 1946, the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), together with the judiciary, have viewed themselves as guardians of Kemalist ideals and the secular Turkish nationalist state established under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk against political parties that have promoted a larger role for Islam and minorities in public life.The military and judiciary have regularly intervened in politics to block or ban popular parties representing conservative Muslim Turks, attempting to relax the restrictions on traditional religious practices, such as women\'s wearing of headscarves.The military has toppled four elected governments: by coups in 1960 and 1980, and by military decisions in 1971 and 1997.The military has also banned several major political parties.In 1998, Erdoğan, then-mayor of Istanbul, was banned for life from politics and jailed because he had read a religious poem by Ziya Gökalp several years before, at a public meeting.In 2007, the military expressed its opposition to the election of Abdullah Gül, of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), as president, by issuing an e-memorandum.Still, Gül was eventually elected when the AKP won both a referendum on the matter.Also, a snap election, and the party returned with a larger majority in the parliament.The military cited erosion of secularism as one of the reasons for the coup in the statement published on the day of the coup.\n\nAs opposed to previous political interventions by the Turkish military, Turkey\'s AKP government and pro-state media maintain that the 15 July 2016 coup attempt was not motivated by allegiance to Kemalist ideology, but rather to the vast political, economic, and religious network led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen.Between 2007 and 2012, high-profile Kemalists, including high-ranking officers of the Turkish Armed Forces, faced a series of trials and purges, under reports of involvement in a secret society codenamed ""Ergenekon.""Supported by Islamist (both pro-Gülen and pro-Erdoğan) prosecutors, security officials, and media, the purges allowed lower-rank Islamist officers to assume high-ranking military positions.They were seen as a bid by Turkey\'s civilian leaders under President Erdoğan to establish dominance over the military.In these trials in 2013 – viewed as ""sensational"" and ""one of the biggest in recent Turkish history"" – 275 people, including senior military officers, journalists, lawyers, and academics, were said to be involved in the so-called ""Ergenekon"" conspiracy, reportedly plotting a coup in 2003/04 against then–Prime Minister Erdoğan.Additionally, some military officers were said to be involved in a separate reported plot, Sledgehammer.Simultaneously, Erdoğan promoted lower-ranking officers up the chain of command, ensuring that the military chief of staff was loyal to him and thereby demoralizing the army.\n\nThe AKP\'s alliance with Gülen started to collapse during 2013 as Gülenists targeted the AKP using corruption charges.After the split, Erdoğan decided it would be advantageous to rehabilitate the army.The ""Ergenekon"" convictions were overturned in April 2016 by the Court of Cassation, which ruled that the existence of the network was unproven.\n\nIn 2013, law enforcement efforts to fight corruption, which had led to the 2013 corruption scandal in Turkey, were faulted by Erdoğan.The anti-corruption efforts were a source of tension between the Gülenists and the AKP.In political analysis in the months prior to the coup attempt, the incidence of corruption was reported to be ""rife"" in Turkey.Following the coup attempt, some coup leaders cited corruption as a reason for their actions.\n\nOn 13 July, less than two days before the coup was launched, Erdoğan signed a bill giving Turkish soldiers immunity from prosecution while taking part in domestic operations.The bill requires cases against commanders to be approved by the prime minister, while district governors may sign cases against lower-ranking soldiers.The immunity bill was seen as part of the détente between the government and the armed forces.The latter has increasingly been taking over military operations in Kurdish-inhabited areas from police and paramilitary units.\n\nOn 15 July 2016, as reported just before 23:00 EEST (UTC+3), military jets were spotted flying over Ankara, and both the Fatih Sultan Mehmet and Bosphorus bridges in Istanbul were closed.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said military action was being ""taken outside the chain of command"" and it was an ""illegal attempt"" to seize power by ""part of the military"".He further said that those involved ""will pay the highest price.""Local media also reported tanks in Istanbul\'s Atatürk Airport.It was reported that Internet users within Turkey were blocked from accessing Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.Twitter later stated that it had ""no reason to think we\'ve been fully blocked"".Some hostages were taken at military headquarters, including the Turkish Chief of the General Staff Hulusi Akar.At around 21:00, the coupists had invited Salih Zeki Çolak, the commander of the Turkish Land Forces to the military headquarters.When he arrived, he was immediately apprehended.Abidin Ünal, head of the Turkish Air Force, who had been attending a wedding in Istanbul, was abducted from there by soldiers who descended from a helicopter.The coupists then tried to force Akar to sign the coup declaration, almost strangling him using a belt in the process.He refused and was then taken to the Akıncı Air Base and other commanders at the headquarters.The military also entered the Justice and Development Party\'s offices in Istanbul and asked people to leave.\n\nEarly reports said President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was safe in Marmaris, south-west Turkey, where he had been on holiday.\n\nFrom around 23:00 to midnight, helicopters bombed the police special forces headquarters and police air force headquarters in Gölbaşı, just outside of Ankara.The attacks left 42 dead and 43 injured.Türksat headquarters in Gölbaşı was also attacked, killing two security personnel.\n\nAt around 23:50, soldiers occupied Taksim Square in central Istanbul.\n\nAt 00:02, it was reported by Reuters that soldiers were inside the buildings of the state broadcaster, the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), in Ankara.During the coup attempt, soldiers forced anchor Tijen Karaş to read out a statement saying that ""the democratic and secular rule of law has been eroded by the current government"" and that Turkey was now led by the Peace at Home Council who would ""ensure the safety of the population.""The statement read in part: ""Turkish Armed Forces have completely taken over the administration of the country to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedoms, the rule of law and general security that was damaged.[...] All international agreements are still valid.We hope that all of our good relationships with all countries will continue.""The plotters said they had ""done so to preserve democratic order, and that the rule of law must remain a priority"".The statement also ordered temporary martial law (sıkıyönetim), and said a new constitution would be prepared ""as soon as possible"".TRT was then taken off air.\n\nOther media outlets were also raided by the putschists, such as Turkish newspaper Hürriyet and private broadcaster CNN Türk.\n\nReuters reported on 15 July that an EU source described the coup as ""well orchestrated,"" and predicted that ""given the scale of the operation, it is difficult to imagine they will stop short of prevailing.""Another EU diplomat said that the Turkish ambassador in his capital was shocked and ""taking it very seriously"".\n\nThe Peace at Home Council was reportedly chaired by Muharrem Köse.\n\nAdana: Upon receiving the intelligence that thirty soldiers from the 10th Air Base Command would move to the base where the regional and provincial gendarmerie commands were located, the police prevented the soldiers from leaving the guardhouse with TOMA and armored vehicles and blocked them.Bitlis: In the Tatvan district of Bitlis, on the orders of Brigade Commander Arif Seddar Afşar, helicopters were circulated in the skies of Tatvan and fired at the city.The brigade command left the municipality\'s construction equipment in front of the barracks in case there was a tank operation in the district.Denizli: Approximately five hundred officers and non-commissioned officers who participated in the coup attempt surrendered to the gendarmerie and police forces.They were interrogated at Çardak District Gendarme Command.Kars: With the order of Kars 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, the soldiers who came with tanks and armored personnel carriers surrounded the Police Headquarters building and wanted to detain Faruk Karaduman, the chief of police.At the same hours, the invitation of Deputy Governors, 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, went to the command.Kocaeli: Turkcell\'s data center in Gebze was raided by soldiers who participated in the coup attempt.Soldiers who tried to interrupt the internet service were detained.Malatya: A rebellious soldier opened fire inside a base of the Turkish 2nd Army, damaging six vehicles.The base was besieged by police and loyal soldiers, and the shooter was captured.Marmaris: Three military helicopters carried out a bomb attack on the hotel where Erdoğan was staying.Forty rebellious soldiers of the Special Forces Command clashed with the police in the region.Mersin: Mersin Garrison and Mediterranean Region Commander Admiral Nejat Atilla Demirhan called Mersin Provincial Police Deputy Chief Yakup Usta and Gendarmerie Colonel Mustafa Bakçepınar and stated that the Turkish Armed Forces had taken over the administration.He introduced himself as the martial law garrison commander and ordered Mersin Governor Özdemir Çakacak and district governors to be taken into custody.Demirhan and Dağdelen, who made the same announcement with the police radio obtained from Mersin Police Department, were detained through the operation of the security forces.Sakarya: Sakarya Governorship was captured with armored personnel carriers, military trucks and many military jeeps from the military unit in the Kandıra district of Kocaeli.As a reinforcement, two military vehicles full of soldiers from the Sakarya central division command had to return to their barracks in the face of the resistance of the police and the harsh reaction of the people who took to the streets against the putschists.The vehicles occupying the Sakarya Governorate were seized by the citizens and the soldiers in them were neutralized and handed over to the security forces.Afterwards, citizens and security forces entered the governor\'s office and neutralized the soldiers there and suppressed the uprising in the province.Eight civilian citizens were injured as a result of the fire opened by the military during the incident.Şırnak: Çakırsöğüt Gendarmerie Commando Brigadier General Ali Osman Gürcan and 309 soldiers, that participated in the coup attempt, were detained by the security forces.\n\nTurkey\'s Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım responded to the events by stating that an ""illegal action is taking place outside of the chain of command"".He also said that ""the government elected by the people remains in charge and this government will only go when the people say so.""The Turkish Presidential office said President Erdoğan was on holiday inside Turkey and condemned the coup attempt as an attack on democracy.A presidential source also said Erdoğan and his government were still in power.The first messages from Erdoğan were transmitted at around 00:23At about 01:00, Erdoğan did a FaceTime interview with CNN Türk, in which he called upon his supporters to take to the streets in defiance of the military-imposed curfew, saying ""There is no power higher than the power of the people.Let them do what they will at the public squares and airports.""Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş appeared on live television, saying Turkey\'s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is still in charge of the government.The mayor of Ankara, Melih Gökçek of the AKP, encouraged people to go out to the city\'s streets in defiance, despite a curfew imposed by the military.Erdoğan\'s plane took off from Dalaman Airport near Marmaris at 23:47, but had to wait in the air south of Atatürk for the airport to be secured.His plane landed at 02:50\n\nThe First Army General Command in Istanbul stated in a news conference that the TSK did not support the coup and the perpetrators represented a tiny faction that were on the verge of being brought under control.Istanbul Atatürk Airport was closed; all flights from the airport were cancelled.There was an explosion in the TRT broadcasting headquarters and gunfire was reported in Ankara.Soon after, it was stormed by a crowd of civilians and police, with four soldiers inside reportedly being ""neutralized"".The channel went back on air and Karaş, who had previously announced the coup, said live that she had been held hostage and forced to read the declaration of the coup at gunpoint.\n\nBy 01:00, it was reported that the military had pulled its forces from the Atatürk airport and people were coming inside, but by 01:13, it was reported that tanks were inside the airport and gunfire was heard.\n\nTanks opened fire near the Turkish Parliament Building.The parliamentary building was also hit from the air.Injuries were reported among protesters following gunfire on Bosphorus Bridge.\n\nA helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was shot down by a Turkish military F-16 fighter jet.There were also reports of pro-state jets flying over Ankara to ""neutralize"" helicopters used by those behind the coup.\n\nAt 03:08, a military helicopter opened fire on the Turkish parliament.At 03:10, Turkish Armed Forces stated on their website that they had complete control over the country.At 03:12, Yıldırım made a statement saying that the situation was under control and that a no-fly zone was declared over Ankara and that military planes that still flew would be shot down.\n\nIt was reported that the Turkish parliament had been bombed again at 03:23 and 03:33.A helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was also seen flying by it.Half an hour following the report of 12 deaths and 2 injuries in the parliament, soldiers entered CNN Türk\'s headquarters and forced the studio to go off air.After an hour of interruption by the pro-coup soldiers, CNN Türk resumed its broadcast.Later, İsmail Kahraman said a bomb exploded at a corner of the public relations building inside the parliament, with no deaths but several injuries among police officers.\n\nAt around 04:00 two or three helicopters attacked Erdogan\'s hotel.According to eyewitness accounts, ten to fifteen heavily armed men landed and started firing.In the ensuing conflict, two policemen were killed and 8 were injured.\n\nThe Doğan News Agency reported that in Istanbul several individuals were injured after soldiers fired on a group of people attempting to cross the Bosphorus Bridge in protest of the attempted coup.\n\nOn Saturday 16 July 2016, at 00:42 EEST (UTC+3), a Turkish Black Hawk helicopter sent a distress signal and requested permission from Greek authorities for an emergency landing, and landed eight minutes later (00:50) at the Dimokritos airport in Alexandroupoli, in Greece, while two Greek F-16s observed the procedure and escorted it to the airport.The first reports said that the passengers were seven military personnel and a civilian.Later, it turned out that all were military personnel (two majors, four captains and two non-commissioned officers).They had removed the badges and insignia from their uniforms, making it impossible to know their rank.All were arrested after landing for illegal entry into the country.They were transferred to the local police station, while the Greek authorities at the airport guarded the helicopter.The eight passengers all requested political asylum in Greece as they believed they would not get a fair trial in Turkey.On 21 September 2016, Greece denied three out of the eight asylum.The men\'s lawyer Stavroula Tomara said they would be appealing the decision and said they had the ""impression that the decision has been predetermined, and that the interview was conducted just as a formality.""On 11 October 2016, four more of the eight were denied asylum.Two of the men who had previously been denied asylum applied for a re-evaluation but their applications were also rejected.\n\nAfter Erdoğan flew into Istanbul, he made a televised speech inside the airport at around 04:00, whilst thousands gathered outside.He addressed a crowd of supporters in the airport, at about 06:30 He said, ""In Turkey, armed forces are not governing the state or leading the state.They cannot.""He blamed ""those in Pennsylvania"" (a reference to Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, and his Hizmet Movement) for the coup attempt.Erdoğan also said he had plans to ""clean up"" the army, saying that ""This uprising is a gift from God to us.""State-run Anadolu Agency named former Colonel Muharrem Köse, who in March 2016 was dishonorably discharged for reported association with Gülen, as the suspected leader of the coup.However, the Alliance for Shared Values, a non-profit organization associated with Gülen, released a statement reiterating that it condemns any military intervention in domestic politics, and saying Erdoğan\'s allegations against the movement were ""highly irresponsible"".Gülen himself said in a brief statement just before midnight: ""As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nReuters reported that in early hours of 16 July, the coup appeared to have ""crumbled"" as crowds defied pro-coup military orders and gathered in major squares of Istanbul and Ankara to oppose it.Reuters also reported pro-coup soldiers surrendering to the police in Taksim Square, Istanbul.It was reported that by 05:18, Atatürk airport had completely been recaptured by the government whilst the police had surrounded the coupists inside the Turkish army headquarters, calling for them to surrender.Between 06:00–08:00 a skirmish took place there.In Akar\'s absence, Ümit Dündar, head of the First Army, was appointed Acting Chief of Staff.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning of 16 July, soldiers blocking the Bosphorus Bridge surrendered to the police.According to the government-run Anadolu Agency, this consisted of a group of 50 soldiers.Some of these soldiers were lynched by civilians despite the police\'s efforts, who fired into the air to protect the surrendering soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile, in the headquarters of the Turkish Army, 700 unarmed soldiers surrendered as the police conducted an operation into the building while 150 armed soldiers were kept inside by the police.The coupists in the TRT building in Istanbul surrendered in the early morning as well.Chief of Staff Akar, held hostage at the Akıncı Air Base in Ankara, was also rescued by pro-state forces.\n\nOne of the primary reasons that the coup failed was chaos among the plotters\' ranks.Turkey\'s National Intelligence Organization (MİT) head Hakan Fidan discovered the coup plot, and the plotters were forced to execute the coup five hours ahead of schedule.One of the main organizers, General Semih Terzi, was shot dead by loyalist Sgt.Maj.Ömer Halisdemir at the onset, demoralizing and disrupting command and control of the rebels.These two incidents resulted in the coup being carried out in an uncoordinated manner.The highest ranking staff officers opposed the coup, and publicly ordered all personnel to return to their barracks.Acting outside the military chain of command, the rebels lacked the coordination and resources to achieve their goals.The conscripted soldiers that the rebels mobilized were uninformed of their mission\'s true purpose and became demoralized.Many surrendered rather than shoot demonstrators.The commander of the First Army in Istanbul, General Ümit Dündar, personally called Erdoğan to warn him of the plot, persuading him to evacuate his hotel ahead of the plotters, and helped to secure Istanbul for Erdoğan to land.The MİT also mobilized its anti-aircraft guns, which the plotters were unaware existed, deterring rebel jets and commando teams.\n\nEqually important to the coup\'s failure, according to military strategist Edward N. Luttwak, was the inability of the rebels to neutralize Erdoğan and other high ranking government officials, either by killing or detaining them.A unit of special forces was sent via helicopter to kill or capture the president, but missed because he had been evacuated by his security detail just minutes before.Once Erdoğan landed at Atatürk International Airport (which had been recaptured from the rebels by his supporters), It became highly unlikely that the coup attempt would succeed.According to a military source, several rebel F-16s targeted Erdoğan\'s presidential jet en route to Istanbul, but they did not fire.A senior Turkish counter-terrorism official later stated that the jets did not fire because the fighter jet pilots were told by President Erdoğan\'s pilot over the radio that the (flight of the) Gulfstream IV was a Turkish Airlines flight.\n\nAccording to Naunihal Singh, author of Seizing Power, the coup attempt also failed because the plotters failed to secure control of the media and shape the narrative.Successful coups require that the rebels control the mass media.This allows even small rebel contingents to portray themselves as fully in control, and their victory as inevitable.Consequently, they convince the public, along with neutral and even loyalist soldiers, to defect to them or not resist.The rebels failed to properly broadcast their messages effectively across the media that they controlled.They failed to capture Türksat, Turkey\'s main cable and satellite communications company, and failed to gain control of the country\'s television and mobile phone networks.This allowed Erdoğan to make his Facetime call, and to speak on television.\n\nOther scholars of civil-military relations, like Drew H. Kinney, have said reports like Luttwak and Singh\'s miss the point of their own analysis: civil resistance thwarted the coup.Luttwak argues that wayward elements of the Turkish armed forces could not silence Erdoğan.Singh says that the rebels could not project success because they couldn\'t control the message.Kinney states that neither of these reasons on their own matter, but rather it\'s their effect—civil disobedience—that is important.We might find that ""[Gülen\'s movement] ...[might] have had nothing to do with the attempted takeover in July, but civilians [nevertheless] definitely played a role in thwarting the coup,"" writes Kinney.""...[A]n unhappy civilian populace mobilized to face down the military.""\n\nErdoğan wasn\'t censored (Luttwak\'s point) and was therefore able to use FaceTime to mobilize resistance, which in turn hindered the conspirators\' ability to project success (Singh\'s point).The result is civilian resistance to soldiers, i.e., people power.The reason Singh, Luttwak, and other scholars of civil-military relations miss this is, according to Kinney, because they ""usually do not study extra-military reasons for coup failures/successes,"" but rather put a premium on ""the inner-workings of the [military] operation.""In short, they blame the military for its failure rather than acknowledge the power of the masses and their successes.\n\nPro-state forces sent text messages to every Turkish citizen calling for them to protest against the coup attempt.Throughout the night sela prayers were repeatedly called from mosque minarets across the country to encourage people to resist the coup plotters.While the sela is usually called from minarets to inform the public of a funeral, they are also traditionally performed to notify of a significant event, in this case ""to rally people"".\n\nThe coup plotters initiated their operation hours ahead of the planned time when they understood that their plans had been compromised.Had the coup been launched at its original time, the middle of the night, much of the population would have been asleep.The streets would have been mostly empty.\n\nReports have emerged, neither confirmed nor denied by Russia or Turkey that the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate intercepted signals on an imminent coup passed on to loyal Turkish operatives.The intercepted plans revealed several helicopters with commandos were on the way to Marmaris\'s coastal resort, where Erdoğan stayed, capturing or killing him.Pre-warned, Erdoğan left quickly to avoid them.\n\nAn extensive purge of the Turkish civil service began in the wake of the coup attempt, with President Erdoğan warning his opponents that ""they will pay a heavy price for this.""The New York Times along with some other Western media such as The Economist, described the purges as a ""counter-coup"", with the Times expecting the president to ""become more vengeful and obsessed with control than ever, exploiting the crisis not just to punish mutinous soldiers but to further quash whatever dissent is left in Turkey,"".As of 20 July 2016, the purge already had seen over 45,000 military officials, police officers, judges, governors and civil servants arrested or suspended, including 2,700 judges, 15,000 teachers, and every university dean in the country.\n\n163 generals and admirals were detained, around 45% of the Turkish military\'s total.\n\nOn 18 July 2016, United States State Secretary John Kerry urged Turkish authorities to halt the increasing crackdown on its citizens, indicating that the crackdown was meant to ""suppress dissent.""French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault voiced concern, warning against a ""political system which turns away from democracy"" in response to the purges.\n\nOn 17 August 2016, Turkey started releasing what was expected to eventually amount to about 38,000 prison inmates, to make more space in the penal system for detainees, numbering about 35,000, who were arrested or detained after being involved in or suspected of association, with the 2016 failed coup.\n\nOn 28 September 2016, Turkish justice minister Bekir Bozdağ said 70,000 people had been processed and 32,000 were formally arrested.\n\nMajor General Cahit Bakir, who commanded Turkish forces under NATO in Afghanistan, and Brigadier General Sener Topuc, responsible for education and aid in Afghanistan, were detained by authorities in Dubai connected with the failed coup.\n\nGeneral Akın Öztürk, former Commander of the Turkish Air Force, was the Turkish military attaché to Israel.He was arrested on charges of having played a leading role in the failed coup.Öztürk has denied the charges.\n\nGeneral Adem Huduti, the commander of the Second Army, positioned along the southern borders with Syria and Iraq, and General Erdal Öztürk, the commander of the 3rd Corps, were also arrested.\n\nRear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been stationed at NATO\'s Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk, Virginia, sought asylum in the United States after being recalled by the Turkish government.\n\nIn July 2018, Istanbul\'s 25th Criminal Court sentenced 72 former soldiers involved in the coup attempt to life in prison.\n\nOn 20 June 2019, a terrorism court in Turkey sentenced 151 people to life in prison, including General Akın Öztürk, former commander of Turkish Air Force and the most senior officer involved in the coup.128 people received ""aggravated life"" sentences, which indicates harsh conditions without parole, for their role in the coup, with another 23 receiving standard life sentences.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom President Erdoğan said as one of the principal conspirators, condemned the coup attempt and denied any role in it.""I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey,"" he said in an emailed statement reported by The New York Times.""Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force.I pray to God for Turkey, Turkish citizens, and all those currently in Turkey that this situation is resolved peacefully and quickly.As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nPresident Erdoğan asked the United States to extradite Gülen: ""I call on you again, after there was a coup attempt.Extradite this man in Pennsylvania to Turkey!If we are strategic partners or model partners, do what is necessary.""Prime Minister Yildirim has threatened war against any country that would support Gülen.Turkish Labor Minister Süleyman Soylu said that ""America is behind the coup.""\n\nRegarding the AKP\'s statement against Gülen, Secretary of State Kerry invited the Turkish government ""to present us with any legitimate evidence that withstands scrutiny,"" before they would accept an extradition request.\n\nOn 15 August 2016, former United States diplomat James Jeffrey, who was the United States ambassador to Turkey from 2008 until 2010 made the following remarks: ""The Gülen movement has some infiltration at the least in the military that I am aware of.They of course had extreme infiltration into the police and judiciary earlier.I saw that when I was in Turkey previously, particularly in the Sledgehammer case, Hakan Fidan case, and the corruption cases in 2013.Obviously, significant segment of Turkey\'s bureaucracy was infiltrated and had their allegiance to a movement.That of course is absolutely unacceptable and extremely dangerous.It likely led to the coup attempt.""\n\nOutside Turkey, in Beringen, Belgium, anti-coup protesters attempted to attack a building owned by the pro-Gülen movement group \'Vuslat\'.The police brought in a water cannon to keep the attackers at bay.In news articles it was stated that the police also protected the houses of Gülen supporters.People advocated on social media to go to Beringen once more, and there was unrest in Heusden-Zolder, elsewhere in Belgium.Furthermore, in Somalia the government ordered ""the total closure of all activities"" of an organization linked to the Gülen movement, and gave its staff seven days to leave the country.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, President Erdoğan said Western countries were ""supporting terrorism"" and the military coup, saying ""I\'m calling on the United States: what kind of strategic partners are we, that you can still host someone whose extradition I have asked for?""\n\nOn 31 January 2017, British Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, Alan Duncan said he believed the Gülen movement was responsible for the coup attempt.Duncan went on saying ""the organization which incorporated itself into the state tried to topple the democratic structure in Turkey"".\n\nIn a speech on 29 July 2016, President Erdoğan said U.S. Central Command chief Joseph Votel was ""siding with coup plotters""; Erdoğan said the United States was protecting Fethullah Gülen, whom the Turkish government blames for the coup attempt.Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim made similar comments.In response, Votel said that the Turkish government\'s statements were ""unfortunate and completely inaccurate"" and expressed concern that the mass arrests and firings of military officers would damage military cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey.Similarly, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said that the Turkish military purges were impairing the fight against ISIS.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, in an escalation of tensions with the United States, Erdoğan questioned Turkey\'s relationship with the United States and criticized the West, saying that ""script"" for the abortive putsch last month was ""written abroad"".Erdoğan stated that he had personally asked Obama to extradite Gülen to Turkey.When the U.S. government replied it would need evidence of the cleric\'s guilt before extradition, to which Erdoğan said: ""When you asked for the return of a terrorist, we did not ask for documentation. ...Let us put him on trial.""\n\nYeni Şafak daily, a Turkish pro-state newspaper, stated that the former commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, now-retired United States Army General John F. Campbell, was the ""mastermind"" behind the coup attempt in Turkey.Campbell called the statement ""absolutely ridiculous"" and President Obama said ""Any reports that we had any previous knowledge of a coup attempt, that there was any U.S. involvement in it, that we were anything other than entirely supportive of Turkish democracy are completely false, unequivocally false.""\n\nOn 1 December 2017, Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for American political analyst, former CIA official and former vice chairman of US National Intelligence Council Graham Fuller, stating his involvement in the coup.A career US State Department official who was once CIA Station Chief in Kabul and later went on to be a political scientist in Rand Corporation specializing in the Middle East, Turkish authorities said Fuller attended a meeting in Istanbul on 15 July 2016 involving organization and coordination of the botched coup.Another American among the attendance, as stated by the Turkish prosecutors, was academic Henri Barkey who was named a suspect a week after the failed coup.\n\nThe U.S. consulate in Turkey issued an advisory to U.S. citizens to avoid the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey, which houses about 50 nuclear bombs, until ""normal operations have been restored"".They stated that local authorities were denying access to the air base and that power supplying the air base was shut off.\n\nThe Incirlik base is important to the U.S.-led effort in Syria to combat ISIL and other militants.Nearly 1,500 American personnel are housed in the base.\n\nTwenty-four hours after initial reports that the air base was shut down, United States defense department officials confirmed that the base and its airspace had re-opened to military aircraft and that operations by American aircraft will resume.The Turkish commander of the air base, brig.Gen. Bekir Ercan Van was arrested.After the failure of the coup Gen Bekir Ercan Van sought asylum from the U.S., but his request was denied by U.S.\n\nFollowing the failed coup attempt multiple media outlets have published editorials advocating the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Incirlik Air base as Turkey is unstable.\n\nOn 16 July, anti-coup protesters chanted against locals in areas of Istanbul with high concentration of Alevis, including Okmeydanı and Gazi.Such incidents also occurred in a quarter of Antakya with a high Alevi population, where a motorcyclist stating to be a sharia advocate was lynched.In a neighbourhood of Ankara, shops belonging to Syrians were attacked by a mob.In Malatya, Sunni Islamists harassed residents of an Alevi neighbourhood, particularly the women, and attempted to enter the neighbourhood en masse.Police intervened and blocked all roads leading there.In Kadıköy, people drinking alcohol in public were attacked by a group of religious fundamentalists.\n\nFollowing the arrests, thousands of anti-coup protesters demanded instituting the death penalty against detainees connected with the coup, chanting ""we want the death penalty"".President Erdoğan has been open to reinstituting the death penalty, noting that ""in a democracy, whatever the people want they will get.""Turkish authorities have not executed anyone since 1984, but legally abolished capital punishment only in 2004 as a pre-condition to join the European Union.\n\nEuropean Union officials have been vocal about their opposition to purges by Turkish authorities in connection to the coup.French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that Turkey must work within the framework of the law to uphold Europe\'s democratic principles.Furthermore, on 18 July 2016, Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of Foreign Affairs of the European Union, announced that no country will be admitted into the European Union ""if it introduces the death penalty"".Moreover, German press secretary, Steffen Seibert, stated that reinstituting the death penalty will end Turkey\'s accession talks with the European Union.\n\nTurkey is a member of the Council of Europe, and ratified the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) as part of its terms of membership.The ECHR is an international treaty that includes the abolition of the death penalty among its terms.As such, Turkey is legally bound not to reintroduce the death penalty.\n\nOn 20 July 2016, President Erdoğan announced a three-month state of emergency in response to the attempted coup, invoking Article 120 of the Constitution of Turkey (""Declaration of state of emergency because of widespread acts of violence and serious deterioration of public order"").Under the state of emergency, under Article 121, ""the Council of Ministers, meeting under the chairpersonship of the President of the Republic, may issue decrees having the force of law on matters necessitated by the state of emergency"", with decrees subject to subsequent parliamentary approval.The state of emergency was endorsed by the Parliament on 21 July by 346 votes to 115.The Justice and Development Party and the Nationalist Movement Party supported the state of emergency, whilst the Republican People\'s Party and the Peoples\' Democratic Party opposed it.Prime Minister Yıldırım said at the Parliament that the state of emergency was necessary to ""get rid of this scourge rapidly"".\n\nAs part of the state of emergency, deputy prime minister Kurtulmuş announced that Turkey was temporarily suspending part of the European Convention on Human Rights following the attempted coup, invoking Article 15 of the Convention (""war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation"").The suspensions must be notified to the Council of Europe and may not affect the right to a fair trial or the prohibition on torture.\n\nThis state of emergency in Turkey as well as the hindrance of the right to protest that occurred within such framework have been layered onto a longer history of emergency rules, oppressive legislation and daily government practice that have reinforced both.We can see from this the ""autocratisation"" process in Turkey has thrived of existing legal framework deeply associated in legacies of past ""emergencies"".\n\nOn 3 October 2016 Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş declared the governments intention to extend the state of emergency by a further three months raising objections from both the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) and Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) were critical of the governments use of their emergency powers and declared that they would vote against an extension.\n\nFollowing the National Security Council\'s recommendation for the extension President Erdoğan stated that it was possible that the state of emergency could last for longer than a year prompting outcry from the opposition, Leader of the Main Opposition Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu said that ""The president saying that the state of emergency can last longer than 12 months is strengthening the fear of a counter-coup"" and that it was ""raising the prospect of opportunist measures.""\n\nThe AKP\'s governmental majority allowed the three-month extension to take effect on 19 October 2016.The two-year-long state of emergency was ended on 19 July 2018.\n\nOn 16 July 2016, the media reported that eight Turkish military personnel of various ranks had landed in Greece\'s northeastern city of Alexandroupolis on board a Black Hawk helicopter and claimed political asylum in Greece.While the Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu demanded extradition of ""the eight traitors as soon as possible"", the Greek authorities stated: ""We will follow the procedures of international law.However, we give severe considerations to the fact that [the Turkish military men] are accused, in their own country, of violating the constitutional order and trying to overthrow democracy.""The helicopter was returned to Turkey shortly thereafter.The eight asylum seekers, their asylum case pending, were later transferred to Athens, mainly for safety reasons.On 26 January, the Supreme Court of Greece eventually ruled against their extradition, on the grounds that the eight were unlikely to face a fair trial if returned to their home country and due to concerns over their safety.\n\nOn 15 February 2017, five Turkish commandos illegally entered Greece through the Evros river.However, once they entered the country, the group split.The two of them surrendered to the police and on 20 February 2017, requested political asylum.They were being held in the city of Alexandroupolis.The two men belonged to the Turkish navy.The names given by the two reportedly match the names of two fugitives wanted in relation to the shadowy operation against Erdoğan himself.The Greek government mentioned that the Greek authorities will not allow the country to be dragged into the ongoing feud between the Turkish state and the followers of Gulen.But there were no sign of the other three.According to a lawyer there were indications that the other three have been arrested by Greek authorities who were about to expel them to Turkey.According to new evidence and new information these three ""arrested"" marines were delivered under fast and informal procedures from Greek to Turkish services.\n\nAfter the coup attempt, two Turkish military attachés in Athens, Staff Col. İlhan Yaşıtlı and naval attaché Col. Halis Tunç, had reportedly disappeared along with their families.The Greek foreign ministry canceled the two attachés\' accreditations on 7 August 2016, upon the request of the Turkish foreign ministry.Greek media reported that they might have fled to Italy.On 11 August 2016, the Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu confirmed the reports saying that they had left Greece for Italy on 6 August and adding that Turkey would officially ask the Italian authorities to extradite the two soldiers.\n\nOn 9 August 2016, the media reported that Turkey\'s Rear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been on a United States-based assignment for NATO and after the coup was subject to a detention order in Turkey, had sought asylum in the United States.\n\nIn mid-November 2016, it was officially confirmed that about 40 Turkish military servicemen of various ranks stationed at NATO command structures had applied for asylum in Germany and Belgium.\n\nIn January 2017, Der Spiegel magazine and ARD broadcaster reported that about 40 mostly high-ranking Turkish soldiers who worked at NATO facilities in Germany requested asylum in Germany.\n\nAt the end of February 2017, Germany said it had received 136 asylum requests from Turks holding diplomatic passports since the July coup attempt.The figure was a total for August 2016 to January 2017; some were presumed to be military officers posted to NATO bases in Germany.\n\nIn November 2016, NATO\'s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that Turkish NATO Officers had requested asylum in the countries where they had been posted.He did not name the nations involved or the number of officers, saying it was a matter for those countries to decide.He said: ""Some Turkish officers working in NATO command structure ... have requested asylum in the countries where they are working. ...As always, this is an issue that is going to be assessed and decided by the different NATO allies as a national issue.""\n\nAs of March 2017, Norway have granted asylum for four Turkish soldiers and a military attache.\n\nSeveral Turkish citizens with diplomatic passports have sought political asylum in Switzerland.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, detainees in Turkey have been denied access to legal counsel, have been beaten and tortured.They have not been provided with adequate food, water, or medical care.At least one has attempted suicide.Amnesty International wanted the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture to send people to check on detainees conditions.A person who had been on duty at the Ankara police headquarters said that police denied medical treatment to a detainee.""Let him die.We will say he came to us dead,"" the witness quoted a police doctor as saying.\n\nAlso, Erdoğan has extended the maximum period of detention for suspects from four days to 30, a move Amnesty said increased the risk of torture or other maltreatment of detainees.\n\nTurkish Justice Ministry denied the reports and the Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said on his Twitter account: ""There has not been any torture or assault of detainees in custody,"" in response to reports by Amnesty International.""The claims of torture and assault make up a pre-packaged misinformation campaign formed by members of FETÖ, one which is untrue and distorted,""\n\nOn 7 August, between three and five million people gathered for an anti-coup rally organized by the Turkish authorities in Istanbul.President Erdoğan and the two leaders of the major opposition parties (the Republican People\'s Party and the Nationalist Movement Party) were present.\n\nGreek authorities on several Aegean islands have called for emergency measures to curtail a growing flow of refugees from Turkey; the number of migrants and refugees willing to make the journey across the Aegean has increased noticeably after the failed coup.At Athens officials voiced worries because Turkish monitors overseeing the deal in Greece had been abruptly pulled out after the failed coup without being replaced.Also, the mayor of Kos expressed concern in a letter to the Greek Prime Minister citing the growing influx of refugees and migrants after the failed coup.The Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises (SETE) warned about the prospect of another flare-up in the refugee/migrant crisis due to the Turkish political instability.\n\nVincent Cochetel, the director of the Europe Bureau of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in August 2016 that parts of the EU-Turkey deal about immigration were already de facto suspended because no Turkish police were present at Greek detention centres to oversee deportations.\n\nOn 25 August 2016, seven Turkish citizens sought asylum in Greece.Two were university professors, and their two children applied for asylum in Alexandroupoli after they illegally entered the country from the northeastern border.Also, three businessmen illegally reached the Greek island of Rhodes, and they also applied for asylum.\n\nOn 30 August 2016, a Turkish judge arrived at the Greek island of Chios on a migrant boat, with six Syrian nationals, and sought asylum in the country.He told the Greek coastguard and police officers that he is being persecuted in Turkey for his political beliefs by President Tayyip Erdoğan.The Turkish judge had been arrested for illegally entering the country and was transferred to Athens for his asylum proceedings.The Syrian nationals claimed refugee status.\n\nOn 11 September 2016, four Turkish civilians were arrested by Turkish police.An academic and a teacher attempted to escape to Greece illegally by crossing the Evros river, and the other two because they organized the escape attempt.The academic and the teacher paid a total of 12,500 euros in Istanbul to arrange their escape to Greece.Before their attempt, both the academic and the teacher were suspended from their duties as part of the ongoing probe into the failed coup attempt.Police also seized an air raft, an oar and a pump while detaining the suspects.The court later ordered the two\'s release while the other two suspects, who organized the escape attempt, were arrested.\n\nOn 21 September 2016, ten Turkish civilians, two men, two women and six children landed by boat illegally on the Greek island of Rhodes and sought asylum.They told the Greek authorities they were working in the private sector in Turkey and the Turkish government was persecuting them due to their political beliefs.\n\nOn 29 September 2016, five Turkish nationals, a couple and their child and two other men, arrived in Greece, at Alexandroupolis by crossing the Evros River by boat illegally and requested political asylum.\n\nOn 12 December 2016, one female Turkish national, landed by boat, full of refugees and immigrants, illegally on the Greek island of Lesbos.She requested political asylum.\n\nOn 24 October 2017, Turkish authorities obtained information that 995 Turks have applied for asylum in Greece after the coup attempt.\n\nMore than 1,800 Turkish citizens requested asylum in Greece in 2017.\n\nOn 18 February 2018, seventeen Turkish nationals, including six children, requested asylum in Greece at Oinousses island.\n\nIn August 2018, the former lawmaker for the Peoples\' Democratic Party, Leyla Birlik, requested asylum in Greece after illegally crossing the border near Alexandroupolis.\n\nBerlin mayor, Michael Müller (SPD), said Turkey was waging war on supporters of the Gülen movement in Germany.He said that Turkish officials had approached him and asked him whether he would be prepared to confront the Gülen movement in Berlin critically and, if necessary, to support measures against it.The mayor rejected the idea and made it very clear that Turkish conflicts could not be waged in the city.\n\nDer Spiegel presented classified documents, which showed that Turkey\'s secret service (MIT) had asked Germany\'s foreign intelligence agency (BND) for help in rounding up Gülen supporters in Germany.The Turkish secret service wanted the BND to use its influence to spur German lawmakers into taking action against Gülen supporters and extraditing them to Turkey.Also, Turkey\'s government has sent German authorities requests for searches and extraditions linked to supporters of Fethullah Gülen in Germany.\n\nIn Germany businesses thought to be in support of the Gülen movement have been harassed by Erdoğan supporters.\n\nAfter the failed coup, there was a massive demonstration in Cologne at Germany, in late July, in support of Turkish President Erdoğan.Erdoğan wanted to address the participants via video but was rejected by the local authorities and the German Constitutional Court due to security concerns.Turkey said that the ban was unacceptable and a violation of freedom of expression.\n\nGerman authorities said Turkish mosques in Germany were playing Turkish politics and worried that Turkey\'s internal politics spilled over into German cities.For years, German authorities had encouraged Turkey\'s state-run religious institution Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs usually referred to as DİTİB to provide Islamic preachers and teachers and Gülen Movement Schools for the large Turkish diaspora in Germany.DİTİB manages some 900 mosques in Germany.Gülen movement runs 100 educational facilities in Germany.\n\nAfter the failed coup DİTİB published a sermon praising ""our noble nation"" for rising against ""a wretched network"" that had sown ""seeds of sedition, rebellion and hostility.""According to Volker Beck, a member of the center-left Greens in Germany\'s Bundestag, ""That was not a religious text.It was a declaration of obedience to Mr. Erdoğan and his measures since the coup attempt,"" Volker Kauder, parliamentary group leader of the Germany\'s ruling Christian Democrats, the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU)/Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) faction, said Turkish-Germans should be loyal to Germany first and foremost.\n\nGermans of Turkish origin are being pressured in Germany by informers and officers of Turkey\'s MIT spy agency.According to reports Turkey had 6,000 informants plus MIT officers in Germany who were putting pressure on ""German Turks"".Hans-Christian Ströbele said that there was an ""unbelievable"" level of ""secret activities"" in Germany by Turkey\'s MIT agency.According to Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, not even the former communist East German Stasi secret police had managed to run such a large ""army of agents"" in the former West Germany: ""Here, it\'s not just about intelligence gathering, but increasingly about intelligence service repression.""\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nGermany\'s Office for Migration and Refugees said on 18 November 2016, it had received 4,437 political asylum requests from Turkish citizens up to October, compared to 1,767 for the whole of last year.""We must expect that the number of Turks who are seeking political asylum in Germany will continue to rise,"" said Stephan Mayer, the domestic policy speaker of the union coalition in the Bundestag.\n\nOn 10 December 2016, eleven Turkish nationals, 10 adults and one child, in a martial arts group have applied for asylum in Germany.\n\nAs of January 2018, Germany was first place and Greece second as EU destinations of choice for Turkish nationals requesting asylum after the coup attempt.\n\nTurkish police have carried out simultaneous raids in 18 cities against companies associated with United States-based Fethullah Gülen.The state-run Anadolu Agency said police searched 204 premises and detained 187 businessmen for ""membership in a terror organization"" and ""providing financial support to a terror organization"".All suspects\' assets were seized.\n\nWikiLeaks released Turkish emails and documents to respond to the Turkish government\'s purges that followed the coup attempt.In turn, the Turkish Telecommunications Communications Board blocked access to the WikiLeaks website.On 17 July 2016 Wikileaks had announced on Twitter, the leak of approximately 300,000 emails and over 500,000 documents, including those to and from AKP.\n\nWikiLeaks stated that it was attacked shortly after 17 July announcement of the planned publication and hypothesized that Turkish authorities were responsible.WikiLeaks stated in a tweet, ""our infrastructure is under sustained attack.""Tweets from WikiLeaks include ""We are unsure of the true origin of the attack.The timing suggests a Turkish state power faction or its allies.We will prevail & publish.""and: ""Turks will likely be censored to prevent them reading our pending release of 100k+ docs on politics leading up to the coup."", ""We ask that Turks are ready with censorship bypassing systems such as TorBrowser and uTorrent""; ""And that everyone else is ready to help them bypass censorship and push our links through the censorship to come.""\n\nUpon the release of the email dump, it has been reported that the emails contain little to no damning information, and instead are just mails from a public mailing list, but also linked externally to ""voter information on all of the women registered to vote in 78 out of Turkey\'s 81 provinces"".\n\nSeveral places were renamed to commemorate the failed coup: Boğaziçi Köprüsü (Bosphorus Bridge) → 15 Temmuz Şehitler Köprüsü Kızılay Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Kızılay Demokrasi Meydanı Ahmet Taner Kışlalı Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Milli İrade Meydanı (Reverted to original name a few days later) Büyük İstanbul Otogarı → İstanbul 15 Temmuz Demokrasi Otogarı In TRT, Yeni Haber Stüdyosu → 15 Temmuz Millet Stüdyosu Kazan → Kahramankazan about the province\'s local people\'s resistance to the coup plotters.Kahraman means ""hero"" in Turkish Niğde University → Niğde Ömer Halisdemir University\n\nIn 2018, the Istanbul Municipal Council decided to change the names of a total of 90 streets that included words which could be associated with FETÖ.\n\nThe Presidency of Religious Affairs stated that it would not be providing religious funeral services to the dead coupists, except for ""privates and low-ranking officers compelled by force and threats who found themselves in the midst of the conflict without full knowledge of anything"".\n\nA document dated 26 September 2016 showed that Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) asked Turkish missions and religious representatives abroad to profile Gülen movement expatriates living in their respective foreign countries.Gülen-linked schools, businesses, foundations, associations, media outlets and others were also included in the reports.Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs has gathered intelligence via imams from 38 countries.\n\nBelgium officials said they would withdraw recognition of Diyanet mosques in the country if necessary.\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nOn 21 December 2016, the Turkish government has recalled Yusuf Acar, the religious affairs attaché of the Turkish Embassy in the Netherlands, after Dutch authorities said he was spying.Acar collected information of people who sympathize with Fethullah Gülen at Netherlands and passed it on to the Turkish authorities.The Dutch government called spying activities an ""unwanted and non-acceptable interference in the lives of Dutch citizens.""and the attaché was reportedly declared persona non grata and received a ""deportation warning"" by Dutch authorities.\n\nOn 26 January 2017, President Erdoğan, during his visit to Tanzania, asked his Tanzanian counterpart John Magufuli to take action against the network of Fethullah Gülen.\n\nIn April 2017 it was announced that President Erdoğan planned to establish a purpose-built museum dedicated to the coup events, called the ""Museum of the 15 July: Martyrs and Democracy"", to be located in Kahramankazan, a town near Ankara.Paid for by Turkish Ministry of Culture funds, it is planned to open at the end of 2018.The museum opened in December 2019\n\nAmong the Turkish opposition parties, the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) issued a statement expressing their public opposition to the coup, and the Hürriyet Daily News reported that Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bahçeli telephoned Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım to express his opposition to the coup.The co-chairs of the opposition Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) issued a statement saying that the party was ""under all circumstances and as a matter of principle against all kinds of coup.""Amongst the minor parties, left-wing nationalist Patriotic Party\'s Doğu Perinçek backed democracy, when he held Gülen and the Americans responsible.Kurdish militant separatist organization Kurdistan Workers\' Party, which Turkey and its allies label as a terrorist organization, urged their supporters to stay away from the coup and rather defend their people, while the Communist Party called upon the people to overthrow the AKP government which they called an ""enemy of humanity"".\n\nDuring the first hours of the coup plotters\' moves of blocking Istanbul\'s bridges and flying fighter jets low over Istanbul and Ankara, Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjørn Jagland tweeted against the coup attempt and underlined that ""any attempt to overthrow the democratically elected leaders is unacceptable"".\n\nRussia\'s President Vladimir Putin called Erdoğan out of solidarity before all NATO member countries\' heads following the coup attempt.Erdoğan thanked the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev – who was the first president to show solidarity after the coup attempt – for his support in solving the 7-month crisis over downed Russian Sukhoi Su-24 and the Prime Minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, who was among the first NATO country leaders to condemn the coup attempt, already from the early hours of Saturday.\n\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the then prime minister of Pakistan, was all praise for the people of Turkey and the AKP government and strongly condemned what he termed as an attempt to undermine democracy in Turkey.""We deeply admire the resolve of the brave and resilient Turkish people, who stood up against the forces of darkness and anarchy to express their support and commitment to democracy,"" the PM said in a statement issued from his office.\n\nThe majority of countries either expressed their support for the government or called for restraint.On 16 July 2016, however, a proposed United Nations Security Council statement denouncing the coup was not accepted by Egypt, a non-permanent member of the Council at the time, due to textual disagreements.Egyptian diplomats said that the council is ""in no position to qualify, or label [the Turkish] government – or any other government for that matter – as democratically elected or not"".Objection by the United States and the UK – permanent members of the Security Council – led to Egypt proposing a new statement calling for all sides to ""respect the democratic and constitutional principles and the rule of law"", which was rejected, preventing the condemnation of the coup attempt by the Security Council.The leader of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky supported the coup attempt.\n\nAl-Monitor reported that ""Unlike Ankara\'s Western allies, Iran did not wait for the coup\'s failure to speak up.Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif voiced support for democracy in a Twitter message in the early hours of the unrest, writing ""Stability, and democracy in Turkey are paramount"".In a subsequent phone call after the failure of the coup attempt, President Hassan Rouhani told Erdoğan the coup attempt was ""a test to identify your domestic and foreign friends and enemies.""An Iranian official pointed out parallels between the coup attempt in Turkey and the coup against Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mussadiq in 1953: ""What we know is that this attempt was triggered by foreign hands.We have experienced the same thing in the past.Since Mr. Erdogan wants to play a more positive path in the region today, they want to overthrow him.""\n\nMustafa Akıncı, President of Northern Cyprus, welcomed the fact that ""no community in Turkey ... applauded the coup as they have done in the past.""Azerbaijan strongly condemned the attempted military coup in Turkey and considered such actions unacceptable according to a statement from Novruz Mammadov, deputy head of the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration and chief of the foreign relations department.\n\nEuropean Commissioner dealing with Turkey\'s EU membership bid, Johannes Hahn, said it appears Turkey\'s government prepared arrest lists of political opponents before the coup attempt and had been waiting for the right time to act.In this sense, EU reported that as a main criticism to put this issue in the category of terrorism become the violation of the fundamental rights and fundamental values of the citizens.Hence, it underlines a total divergence of opinions and mentality between EU and Turkey which reached a deadlock here especially after the 15th of July in 2016.\n\nOn 19 July 2016, White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said during a press briefing that President Barack Obama has held a phone conversation with President Erdoğan: ""The President used the phone call to reiterate once again the strong commitment of the United States to the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey.The President pledged any needed assistance to the Turkish government as they conduct an investigation to determine exactly what happened.""\n\nOn 20 July 2016, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""Turkey has a large armed force, professional armed forces and ...I am certain they will continue as a committed and strong NATO ally.""On a statement released on 10 August 2016, the Secretary General once more strongly condemned the attempted coup and reiterated full support for Turkey\'s democratic institutions.He also expressed support for the elected Turkish government and respect for the courage of the Turkish people for resisting the coup plotters.\n\nOn 29 July 2016, the commander of U.S. Central Command, General Joseph Votel, denied statements by Turkey\'s president Erdoğan that he has supported the coup attempt in Turkey.\n\nOn 1 August 2016, United States Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, General Joseph Dunford, visited Turkey and condemned the coup attempt.Dunford said: ""The consistent theme throughout the day was a reaffirmation of the importance of the U.S.-Turkey relationship – the need for us to cooperate.""\n\nOn July, 20, there were reports that a group of Turkish military commandos coup fugitives would try to cross from Turkey to the island of Symi, in the southeastern Aegean, at Greece.The Hellenic Coast Guard was on alert and increased the patrols in the area, especially after a group of inflatable dinghies and other vessels were seen departing from Datça, on the Turkish coast, in the direction of Symi, they monitored the movements of the Turkish vessels, which remained in Turkish waters.Furthermore, a contingent of the Hellenic Police was dispatched to Symi to conduct checks there.The Greek government had been anticipating a possible attempt by participants in the failed coup to come to Greece and took the reports seriously.Turkish F-16 fighter jets were also scrambled to check reports that missing Turkish coast guard vessels had appeared in Greek waters in the Aegean.Later on the day, the Turkish interior ministry denied reports that rebel soldiers might have ""hijacked"" a vessel to flee to Greece.The Greek armed forces remained on alert the throughout the day for potential coup fugitives.\n\nAccording to Michael Rubin, from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Erdoğan had himself to blame for the coup.Following an increasingly Islamist agenda, Erdoğan had reportedly ""dropped any pretense of governing for all Turks.""After ""fanning the flames"" at the 2013 Gezi Park protests, he transformed the predominantly Kurdish-inhabited areas of southeastern Turkey ""into a war zone reminiscent of the worst days of the 1980s.""The biggest problem, according to Rubin, might have been Erdoğan\'s foreign policy, which managed to turn the initial ""no problems with neighbors"" doctrine into a situation where the country has problems with almost every neighbor and has even alienated some of its allies and friends.Rubin previously worked as an official at the Pentagon and less than 4 months before the coup, he wrote an article in Newsweek magazine titled, ""Will There Be a Coup Against Erdogan in Turkey?""\n\nBritish Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk warned that ""too late did Erdoğan realize the cost of the role he had chosen for his country.It\'s one thing to say sorry to Putin and patch up relations with Netanyahu; but when you can no longer trust your army, there are more serious matters to concentrate upon.""Even if this coup may have failed, Fisk expected another to follow in the months or years to come.\n\nTurkish professor Akın Ünver described the coup d\'état attempt as ""more of a mutiny"".\n\nThe name of the ""Peace at Home Council"" – Yurtta Sulh Konseyi – is derived from Atatürk\'s famous saying \'Peace at Home, Peace in the World\'.Journalist Ezgi Başaran said that ""the statement of the junta, that was [...] read on the [...] government TV [channel] as the coup got under way, bore a strong resemblance to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk\'s famous address to the Turkish Youth.[...] On the other hand, given that these references are too obvious, they may have been intentionally included to insinuate a Kemalist junta rather than a Gülenist one.""\n\nThe citizen journalism site Bellingcat published an analysis of the messages of a WhatsApp group consisting of high-ranking military officials who had taken part in the coup covering their activities including them killing several people.The messages were cross referenced with video footage.The group was named ""Yurtta sulh"" which refers to a peace at home speech and they seem secular and military with no references to Gülen or anything related during the several hours of messaging.\n\nNews reports have suggested that the coup ringleader was Adil Öksüz.Some believe Öksüz to have been an operative with Turkish intelligence.\n\nGerman Islamic studies scholar said the putschists tried to forestall a large-scale purge of judiciary and military, the implementation of which had already started on Saturday, the day after the coup attempt.According to Turkish investigative journalist Ahmet Şık, a list of officials to be purged had been ready compiled by the attorney-general of Izmir, Okan Bato, and was approved by President Erdoğan.According to this version, the putschists had to quickly bring forward their coup attempt before being disposed and arrested.\n\nDuring and after the events, several politicians and commentators suggested that the government knew about the coup in advance and possibly directed it.The facts that the coup attempt began in the evening rather than at a more inconspicuous time and that the events were largely confined to Ankara and Istanbul contributed to doubts about the authenticity of the coup attempt.Journalists and opposition politicians branded it a \'tragic comedy\' and \'theatre play\'.Advocates of such theories pointed to how Erdoğan stood to gain from the coup attempt in terms of increasing his popularity and support for his calls for an executive presidency, while being able to legitimize further crackdowns on judicial independence and the opposition in general.\n\nOther elements that were reported to support the theory included: no list of demands by the coup plotters, the organization and response of the police, the long lists of arrests that seemed to be ready surprisingly quickly (including arrests of 2,745 judges and 2,839 soldiers), and the obvious nature of the coup actions.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom Erdoğan had said as being one of the principal conspirators, commented, ""I don\'t believe that the world believes the accusations made by President Erdoğan.There is a possibility that it could be a staged coup and it could be meant for further accusations [against the Gülenists].""Journalist Cengiz Çandar, a veteran observer of Turkey\'s coups, said ""I have never seen any with this magnitude of such inexplicable sloppiness.""Prominent Hizmet (Gülen movement) spokesman Alp Aslandogan said, referencing that the Turkish Air Force commander met with Erdoğan before 15 July, that certain legal documentation related to the coup seemed written beforehand, arguing that within ""the indictment written by a prosecutor on the night of 15 July to 16 July, there were events there that didn\'t actually happen.Some events did happen, but those events didn\'t happen by the time the document started.It looks like a bigger plan was there, and part of the plan did not come to pass.""\n\nThe organization and spontaneous synchronization by large numbers of mosques was perceived to be unachievable unless there had been prior preparation, with journalists also pointing to how Erdoğan could have strategically used the call to prayer to invoke religious sentiment in a political situation as a veiled attack on state secularism.\n\nThousands of arrests and purges were conducted by Turkish authorities between 16 and 18 July 2016.The sheer number of these arrests made at such a speed could only be done so if the ""Turkish government had all those lists ready"", as suggested by Johannes Hahn, European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, on 18 July 2016.Hahn also said that because these lists were already available immediately after the coup, the ""event was prepared"" and the lists were to be used ""at a certain stage"".\n\nMehmet Dişli, who was seen giving orders to the coup plotters and who was the one who put a belt around Hulusi Akar\'s neck to make him sign, is the brother of Şaban Dişli, a former vice president of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and confidant of Erdoğan.\n\nSeveral social media users have compared the coup attempt to the Reichstag fire in 1933, which Adolf Hitler used as an excuse to suspend civil liberties and order mass arrests of his opponents.Politico correspondent Ryan Heath said that ""the coup was staged to allow Erdoğan to purge the military of opponents and increase his grip on the country"".Heath used Twitter to share comments from his Turkish source, who called the events of Friday night a ""fake coup"" which would help a ""fake democracy warrior"" (referring to Erdoğan).The source said: ""Probably we\'ll see an early election [in] which he\'ll try to guarantee an unbelievable majority of the votes.And this will probably guarantee another 10–15 years of authoritarian, elected dictatorship.""\n\nThe New York Times reported that some Turkish citizens believed the coup attempt was staged by Erdoğan to improve his public image and popularity, while cracking down on political opponents and expanding his power.Critics found it suspect that reportedly no government officials were arrested or harmed during the attempted coup, which—among other factors—raised the suspicion of a false flag event staged by the Turkish government to crack down on opposition parties.Those in Turkey suggesting that the coup was staged are also being questioned by the government.\n\nPoliticians and journalists who were skeptical of the authenticity of the coup plot said that in reality, a \'civil coup\' had effectively been staged against the Armed Forces and Judiciary, both of which were extensively purged of stated Gülen supporters by the government shortly after the events.Skeptics said that the coup would be used as an excuse for further erosion of judicial independence and a crackdown on the opposition, giving the AKP greater and unstoppable power over all state institutions and paving the way for a more radical Islamist agenda at odds with the founding principles of the Turkish Republic.\n\nJustice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said in late July 2016 that Turkish social media users who said the government was staging the coup faced investigation: ""Just look at the people who are saying on social media that this was theatre.Public prosecutors are already investigating them.Most of them are losers who think it is an honor to die for Fethullah Gülen\'s command.""\n\nOn 12 July 2017, Stockholm Center for Freedom, a monitoring group with reported links to the Gülen movement, published a controversial report stating that President Erdogan orchestrated the coup bid as a false flag to consolidate his powers, set up his opposition for a mass persecution, and push Turkish Armed Forces into a military incursion into Syria.According to the report, it uncovered new evidence from 11 July 2016, four days before the planned coup bid, that a secret plan was circulated among select group of Armed Forces to give an appearance of a coup attempt.The plan was sanctioned by intelligence and military chiefs with the approval of Erdogan.\n\nIn early November 2017, Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for , former Director of the Middle East Program of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, stating that he is an agent of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), that he was present in Istanbul during the 2016 Turkish coup attempt, and that he was one of the key organizers behind the coup attempt.Around 1 December, the Istanbul prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for Graham E. Fuller, an American author and political analyst specializing in Islamic extremism after a long CIA career and holding the role of vice-chair of the United States National Intelligence Council.The prosecutor\'s office based the warrant on suspicion of Fuller helping to plan the coup attempt.Hürriyet stated that Turkish authorities believed that they had traced Fuller\'s location before the attempted coup and afterward when he left Turkey.\n\nBarkey denied his reported role in the coup, describing the claims as ""so ludicrous that they do not even deserve the term \'science fiction\'.""\n\nDeep state in Turkey The Imam\'s Army List of coups and coup attempts since 2010 List of modern conflicts in the Middle East List of attacks on legislatures\n', 'Claim_Context': 'In March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.

entrance of the Bosphorus Bridge, but failed to do so after forces and civilians loyal to the state defeated them.The Council cited an erosion of secularism, elimination of democratic rule, disregard for human rights, and Turkey\'s loss of credibility in the international arena as reasons for the coup.The government said it had evidence the coup leaders were linked to the Gülen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the Republic of Turkey and led by Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish businessman and a well-known Islamic scholar who lives in exile in Pennsylvania.The Turkish government alleged that Gülen was behind the coup (which Gülen denied) and that the United States was harboring him.Events surrounding the coup attempt and the purges in its aftermath reflect a complex power struggle between Islamist elites in Turkey.\n\nDuring the coup attempt, over 300 people were killed and more than 2,100 were injured.Many government buildings, including the Turkish Parliament and the Presidential Palace, were bombed from the air.Mass arrests followed, with at least 40,000 detained, including at least 10,000 soldiers and 2,745 judges, for being affiliated with the coup attempt.15,000 education staff were also suspended and the licenses of 21,000 teachers working at private institutions were revoked after the government stated they were loyal to Gülen.More than 77,000 people have been arrested and over 160,000 fired from their jobs, on reports of connections to Gülen.\n\nThere were many reactions against the coup attempt, both domestically and internationally.The main opposition parties in Turkey condemned the attempt, while several international leaders—such as those of the United States, NATO, the European Union, and neighboring countries—called for ""respect of the democratic institutions in Turkey and its elected officials.""Many international organizations also opposed the coup.The United Nations Security Council, however, did not denounce the coup after disagreements over the phrasing of a statement.Iran opposed the coup and advised Erdogan to defeat the coup plotters.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the head of United States Central Command, General Joseph Votel, was ""siding with coup plotters"", after Votel criticized the Turkish government for arresting the Pentagon\'s contacts in Turkey.\n\nIn March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.The same month, the British Parliament\'s Foreign Affairs Select Committee said some Gulenists were involved in the coup d\'état attempt but found no hard evidence that Fethullah Gülen masterminded the failed coup and found no evidence to justify the United Kingdom designating the Gülen movement as a ""terrorist organization"".\n\nSince the 1970s, followers of the influential cleric Fethullah Gülen had assumed increasingly important positions within the Turkish state apparatus.Gülen several times advised his followers to take key positions in society and government, if necessary with a secret identity to avoid opposition from the laicistic Turkish army and government.Nevertheless, at the start of the 21st century, Gülen\'s followers achieved crucial positions of power in Turkey (and beyond) with a vast network of newspapers, TV channels, schools, associations, lobby organizations, financial institutions and positions within the state such as the army and the judiciary.Initially, the then Prime Minister Erdogan seemingly tolerated the power of the Gülen movement because of common interests such as limiting the undemocratic political power of the military, but also because of impotence and fear of Gülen\'s power within Turkey.\n\nA series of events eventually led to a rift between Erdogan and Gülen.For example, prosecutors that allegedly were aligned with the Gülen movement tried to arrest the intelligence chief Hakan Fidan for the peace negotiations with the PKK, and by extension PM Erdogan subsequently, as the Turkish secret service is directly subordinate to the prime minister of Turkey.During this period (2010-2013), state secrets were leaked, fraud was committed with the entrance exams for government employees (KPSS), a change of power occurred at the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) and (sex)tapes of both government members and opposition members were leaked.Following these events and other incidents, the Turkish government decided to designate the Gülen movement as parallel state and FETÖ (Fethullahist Terror Organization).Alleged Gülen supporters were fired or arrested.The coup attempt that followed is therefore also described by some analysts as a last desperate attempt by Gülenists to retain power.\n\nIt is widely reported that Kemalist ideology played a huge role in motivating the 15 July 2016 coup attempt, like all previous political interventions in the history of Turkey\'s military coups.Since the establishment of multiparty democracy in Turkey in 1946, the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), together with the judiciary, have viewed themselves as guardians of Kemalist ideals and the secular Turkish nationalist state established under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk against political parties that have promoted a larger role for Islam and minorities in public life.The military and judiciary have regularly intervened in politics to block or ban popular parties representing conservative Muslim Turks, attempting to relax the restrictions on traditional religious practices, such as women\'s wearing of headscarves.The military has toppled four elected governments: by coups in 1960 and 1980, and by military decisions in 1971 and 1997.The military has also banned several major political parties.In 1998, Erdoğan, then-mayor of Istanbul, was banned for life from politics and jailed because he had read a religious poem by Ziya Gökalp several years before, at a public meeting.In 2007, the military expressed its opposition to the election of Abdullah Gül, of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), as president, by issuing an e-memorandum.Still, Gül was eventually elected when the AKP won both a referendum on the matter.Also, a snap election, and the party returned with a larger majority in the parliament.The military cited erosion of secularism as one of the reasons for the coup in the statement published on the day of the coup.\n\nAs opposed to previous political interventions by the Turkish military, Turkey\'s AKP government and pro-state media maintain that the 15 July 2016 coup attempt was not motivated by allegiance to Kemalist ideology, but rather to the vast political, economic, and religious network led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen.Between 2007 and 2012, high-profile Kemalists, including high-ranking officers of the Turkish Armed Forces, faced a series of trials and purges, under reports of involvement in a secret society codenamed ""Ergenekon.""Supported by Islamist (both pro-Gülen and pro-Erdoğan) prosecutors, security officials, and media, the purges allowed lower-rank Islamist officers to assume high-ranking military positions.They were seen as a bid by Turkey\'s civilian leaders under President Erdoğan to establish dominance over the military.In these trials in 2013 – viewed as ""sensational"" and ""one of the biggest in recent Turkish history"" – 275 people, including senior military officers, journalists, lawyers, and academics, were said to be involved in the so-called ""Ergenekon"" conspiracy, reportedly plotting a coup in 2003/04 against then–Prime Minister Erdoğan.Additionally, some military officers were said to be involved in a separate reported plot, Sledgehammer.Simultaneously, Erdoğan promoted lower-ranking officers up the chain of command, ensuring that the military chief of staff was loyal to him and thereby demoralizing the army.\n\nThe AKP\'s alliance with Gülen started to collapse during 2013 as Gülenists targeted the AKP using corruption charges.After the split, Erdoğan decided it would be advantageous to rehabilitate the army.The ""Ergenekon"" convictions were overturned in April 2016 by the Court of Cassation, which ruled that the existence of the network was unproven.\n\nIn 2013, law enforcement efforts to fight corruption, which had led to the 2013 corruption scandal in Turkey, were faulted by Erdoğan.The anti-corruption efforts were a source of tension between the Gülenists and the AKP.In political analysis in the months prior to the coup attempt, the incidence of corruption was reported to be ""rife"" in Turkey.Following the coup attempt, some coup leaders cited corruption as a reason for their actions.\n\nOn 13 July, less than two days before the coup was launched, Erdoğan signed a bill giving Turkish soldiers immunity from prosecution while taking part in domestic operations.The bill requires cases against commanders to be approved by the prime minister, while district governors may sign cases against lower-ranking soldiers.The immunity bill was seen as part of the détente between the government and the armed forces.The latter has increasingly been taking over military operations in Kurdish-inhabited areas from police and paramilitary units.\n\nOn 15 July 2016, as reported just before 23:00 EEST (UTC+3), military jets were spotted flying over Ankara, and both the Fatih Sultan Mehmet and Bosphorus bridges in Istanbul were closed.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said military action was being ""taken outside the chain of command"" and it was an ""illegal attempt"" to seize power by ""part of the military"".He further said that those involved ""will pay the highest price.""Local media also reported tanks in Istanbul\'s Atatürk Airport.It was reported that Internet users within Turkey were blocked from accessing Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.Twitter later stated that it had ""no reason to think we\'ve been fully blocked"".Some hostages were taken at military headquarters, including the Turkish Chief of the General Staff Hulusi Akar.At around 21:00, the coupists had invited Salih Zeki Çolak, the commander of the Turkish Land Forces to the military headquarters.When he arrived, he was immediately apprehended.Abidin Ünal, head of the Turkish Air Force, who had been attending a wedding in Istanbul, was abducted from there by soldiers who descended from a helicopter.The coupists then tried to force Akar to sign the coup declaration, almost strangling him using a belt in the process.He refused and was then taken to the Akıncı Air Base and other commanders at the headquarters.The military also entered the Justice and Development Party\'s offices in Istanbul and asked people to leave.\n\nEarly reports said President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was safe in Marmaris, south-west Turkey, where he had been on holiday.\n\nFrom around 23:00 to midnight, helicopters bombed the police special forces headquarters and police air force headquarters in Gölbaşı, just outside of Ankara.The attacks left 42 dead and 43 injured.Türksat headquarters in Gölbaşı was also attacked, killing two security personnel.\n\nAt around 23:50, soldiers occupied Taksim Square in central Istanbul.\n\nAt 00:02, it was reported by Reuters that soldiers were inside the buildings of the state broadcaster, the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), in Ankara.During the coup attempt, soldiers forced anchor Tijen Karaş to read out a statement saying that ""the democratic and secular rule of law has been eroded by the current government"" and that Turkey was now led by the Peace at Home Council who would ""ensure the safety of the population.""The statement read in part: ""Turkish Armed Forces have completely taken over the administration of the country to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedoms, the rule of law and general security that was damaged.[...] All international agreements are still valid.We hope that all of our good relationships with all countries will continue.""The plotters said they had ""done so to preserve democratic order, and that the rule of law must remain a priority"".The statement also ordered temporary martial law (sıkıyönetim), and said a new constitution would be prepared ""as soon as possible"".TRT was then taken off air.\n\nOther media outlets were also raided by the putschists, such as Turkish newspaper Hürriyet and private broadcaster CNN Türk.\n\nReuters reported on 15 July that an EU source described the coup as ""well orchestrated,"" and predicted that ""given the scale of the operation, it is difficult to imagine they will stop short of prevailing.""Another EU diplomat said that the Turkish ambassador in his capital was shocked and ""taking it very seriously"".\n\nThe Peace at Home Council was reportedly chaired by Muharrem Köse.\n\nAdana: Upon receiving the intelligence that thirty soldiers from the 10th Air Base Command would move to the base where the regional and provincial gendarmerie commands were located, the police prevented the soldiers from leaving the guardhouse with TOMA and armored vehicles and blocked them.Bitlis: In the Tatvan district of Bitlis, on the orders of Brigade Commander Arif Seddar Afşar, helicopters were circulated in the skies of Tatvan and fired at the city.The brigade command left the municipality\'s construction equipment in front of the barracks in case there was a tank operation in the district.Denizli: Approximately five hundred officers and non-commissioned officers who participated in the coup attempt surrendered to the gendarmerie and police forces.They were interrogated at Çardak District Gendarme Command.Kars: With the order of Kars 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, the soldiers who came with tanks and armored personnel carriers surrounded the Police Headquarters building and wanted to detain Faruk Karaduman, the chief of police.At the same hours, the invitation of Deputy Governors, 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, went to the command.Kocaeli: Turkcell\'s data center in Gebze was raided by soldiers who participated in the coup attempt.Soldiers who tried to interrupt the internet service were detained.Malatya: A rebellious soldier opened fire inside a base of the Turkish 2nd Army, damaging six vehicles.The base was besieged by police and loyal soldiers, and the shooter was captured.Marmaris: Three military helicopters carried out a bomb attack on the hotel where Erdoğan was staying.Forty rebellious soldiers of the Special Forces Command clashed with the police in the region.Mersin: Mersin Garrison and Mediterranean Region Commander Admiral Nejat Atilla Demirhan called Mersin Provincial Police Deputy Chief Yakup Usta and Gendarmerie Colonel Mustafa Bakçepınar and stated that the Turkish Armed Forces had taken over the administration.He introduced himself as the martial law garrison commander and ordered Mersin Governor Özdemir Çakacak and district governors to be taken into custody.Demirhan and Dağdelen, who made the same announcement with the police radio obtained from Mersin Police Department, were detained through the operation of the security forces.Sakarya: Sakarya Governorship was captured with armored personnel carriers, military trucks and many military jeeps from the military unit in the Kandıra district of Kocaeli.As a reinforcement, two military vehicles full of soldiers from the Sakarya central division command had to return to their barracks in the face of the resistance of the police and the harsh reaction of the people who took to the streets against the putschists.The vehicles occupying the Sakarya Governorate were seized by the citizens and the soldiers in them were neutralized and handed over to the security forces.Afterwards, citizens and security forces entered the governor\'s office and neutralized the soldiers there and suppressed the uprising in the province.Eight civilian citizens were injured as a result of the fire opened by the military during the incident.Şırnak: Çakırsöğüt Gendarmerie Commando Brigadier General Ali Osman Gürcan and 309 soldiers, that participated in the coup attempt, were detained by the security forces.\n\nTurkey\'s Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım responded to the events by stating that an ""illegal action is taking place outside of the chain of command"".He also said that ""the government elected by the people remains in charge and this government will only go when the people say so.""The Turkish Presidential office said President Erdoğan was on holiday inside Turkey and condemned the coup attempt as an attack on democracy.A presidential source also said Erdoğan and his government were still in power.The first messages from Erdoğan were transmitted at around 00:23At about 01:00, Erdoğan did a FaceTime interview with CNN Türk, in which he called upon his supporters to take to the streets in defiance of the military-imposed curfew, saying ""There is no power higher than the power of the people.Let them do what they will at the public squares and airports.""Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş appeared on live television, saying Turkey\'s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is still in charge of the government.The mayor of Ankara, Melih Gökçek of the AKP, encouraged people to go out to the city\'s streets in defiance, despite a curfew imposed by the military.Erdoğan\'s plane took off from Dalaman Airport near Marmaris at 23:47, but had to wait in the air south of Atatürk for the airport to be secured.His plane landed at 02:50\n\nThe First Army General Command in Istanbul stated in a news conference that the TSK did not support the coup and the perpetrators represented a tiny faction that were on the verge of being brought under control.Istanbul Atatürk Airport was closed; all flights from the airport were cancelled.There was an explosion in the TRT broadcasting headquarters and gunfire was reported in Ankara.Soon after, it was stormed by a crowd of civilians and police, with four soldiers inside reportedly being ""neutralized"".The channel went back on air and Karaş, who had previously announced the coup, said live that she had been held hostage and forced to read the declaration of the coup at gunpoint.\n\nBy 01:00, it was reported that the military had pulled its forces from the Atatürk airport and people were coming inside, but by 01:13, it was reported that tanks were inside the airport and gunfire was heard.\n\nTanks opened fire near the Turkish Parliament Building.The parliamentary building was also hit from the air.Injuries were reported among protesters following gunfire on Bosphorus Bridge.\n\nA helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was shot down by a Turkish military F-16 fighter jet.There were also reports of pro-state jets flying over Ankara to ""neutralize"" helicopters used by those behind the coup.\n\nAt 03:08, a military helicopter opened fire on the Turkish parliament.At 03:10, Turkish Armed Forces stated on their website that they had complete control over the country.At 03:12, Yıldırım made a statement saying that the situation was under control and that a no-fly zone was declared over Ankara and that military planes that still flew would be shot down.\n\nIt was reported that the Turkish parliament had been bombed again at 03:23 and 03:33.A helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was also seen flying by it.Half an hour following the report of 12 deaths and 2 injuries in the parliament, soldiers entered CNN Türk\'s headquarters and forced the studio to go off air.After an hour of interruption by the pro-coup soldiers, CNN Türk resumed its broadcast.Later, İsmail Kahraman said a bomb exploded at a corner of the public relations building inside the parliament, with no deaths but several injuries among police officers.\n\nAt around 04:00 two or three helicopters attacked Erdogan\'s hotel.According to eyewitness accounts, ten to fifteen heavily armed men landed and started firing.In the ensuing conflict, two policemen were killed and 8 were injured.\n\nThe Doğan News Agency reported that in Istanbul several individuals were injured after soldiers fired on a group of people attempting to cross the Bosphorus Bridge in protest of the attempted coup.\n\nOn Saturday 16 July 2016, at 00:42 EEST (UTC+3), a Turkish Black Hawk helicopter sent a distress signal and requested permission from Greek authorities for an emergency landing, and landed eight minutes later (00:50) at the Dimokritos airport in Alexandroupoli, in Greece, while two Greek F-16s observed the procedure and escorted it to the airport.The first reports said that the passengers were seven military personnel and a civilian.Later, it turned out that all were military personnel (two majors, four captains and two non-commissioned officers).They had removed the badges and insignia from their uniforms, making it impossible to know their rank.All were arrested after landing for illegal entry into the country.They were transferred to the local police station, while the Greek authorities at the airport guarded the helicopter.The eight passengers all requested political asylum in Greece as they believed they would not get a fair trial in Turkey.On 21 September 2016, Greece denied three out of the eight asylum.The men\'s lawyer Stavroula Tomara said they would be appealing the decision and said they had the ""impression that the decision has been predetermined, and that the interview was conducted just as a formality.""On 11 October 2016, four more of the eight were denied asylum.Two of the men who had previously been denied asylum applied for a re-evaluation but their applications were also rejected.\n\nAfter Erdoğan flew into Istanbul, he made a televised speech inside the airport at around 04:00, whilst thousands gathered outside.He addressed a crowd of supporters in the airport, at about 06:30 He said, ""In Turkey, armed forces are not governing the state or leading the state.They cannot.""He blamed ""those in Pennsylvania"" (a reference to Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, and his Hizmet Movement) for the coup attempt.Erdoğan also said he had plans to ""clean up"" the army, saying that ""This uprising is a gift from God to us.""State-run Anadolu Agency named former Colonel Muharrem Köse, who in March 2016 was dishonorably discharged for reported association with Gülen, as the suspected leader of the coup.However, the Alliance for Shared Values, a non-profit organization associated with Gülen, released a statement reiterating that it condemns any military intervention in domestic politics, and saying Erdoğan\'s allegations against the movement were ""highly irresponsible"".Gülen himself said in a brief statement just before midnight: ""As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nReuters reported that in early hours of 16 July, the coup appeared to have ""crumbled"" as crowds defied pro-coup military orders and gathered in major squares of Istanbul and Ankara to oppose it.Reuters also reported pro-coup soldiers surrendering to the police in Taksim Square, Istanbul.It was reported that by 05:18, Atatürk airport had completely been recaptured by the government whilst the police had surrounded the coupists inside the Turkish army headquarters, calling for them to surrender.Between 06:00–08:00 a skirmish took place there.In Akar\'s absence, Ümit Dündar, head of the First Army, was appointed Acting Chief of Staff.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning of 16 July, soldiers blocking the Bosphorus Bridge surrendered to the police.According to the government-run Anadolu Agency, this consisted of a group of 50 soldiers.Some of these soldiers were lynched by civilians despite the police\'s efforts, who fired into the air to protect the surrendering soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile, in the headquarters of the Turkish Army, 700 unarmed soldiers surrendered as the police conducted an operation into the building while 150 armed soldiers were kept inside by the police.The coupists in the TRT building in Istanbul surrendered in the early morning as well.Chief of Staff Akar, held hostage at the Akıncı Air Base in Ankara, was also rescued by pro-state forces.\n\nOne of the primary reasons that the coup failed was chaos among the plotters\' ranks.Turkey\'s National Intelligence Organization (MİT) head Hakan Fidan discovered the coup plot, and the plotters were forced to execute the coup five hours ahead of schedule.One of the main organizers, General Semih Terzi, was shot dead by loyalist Sgt.Maj.Ömer Halisdemir at the onset, demoralizing and disrupting command and control of the rebels.These two incidents resulted in the coup being carried out in an uncoordinated manner.The highest ranking staff officers opposed the coup, and publicly ordered all personnel to return to their barracks.Acting outside the military chain of command, the rebels lacked the coordination and resources to achieve their goals.The conscripted soldiers that the rebels mobilized were uninformed of their mission\'s true purpose and became demoralized.Many surrendered rather than shoot demonstrators.The commander of the First Army in Istanbul, General Ümit Dündar, personally called Erdoğan to warn him of the plot, persuading him to evacuate his hotel ahead of the plotters, and helped to secure Istanbul for Erdoğan to land.The MİT also mobilized its anti-aircraft guns, which the plotters were unaware existed, deterring rebel jets and commando teams.\n\nEqually important to the coup\'s failure, according to military strategist Edward N. Luttwak, was the inability of the rebels to neutralize Erdoğan and other high ranking government officials, either by killing or detaining them.A unit of special forces was sent via helicopter to kill or capture the president, but missed because he had been evacuated by his security detail just minutes before.Once Erdoğan landed at Atatürk International Airport (which had been recaptured from the rebels by his supporters), It became highly unlikely that the coup attempt would succeed.According to a military source, several rebel F-16s targeted Erdoğan\'s presidential jet en route to Istanbul, but they did not fire.A senior Turkish counter-terrorism official later stated that the jets did not fire because the fighter jet pilots were told by President Erdoğan\'s pilot over the radio that the (flight of the) Gulfstream IV was a Turkish Airlines flight.\n\nAccording to Naunihal Singh, author of Seizing Power, the coup attempt also failed because the plotters failed to secure control of the media and shape the narrative.Successful coups require that the rebels control the mass media.This allows even small rebel contingents to portray themselves as fully in control, and their victory as inevitable.Consequently, they convince the public, along with neutral and even loyalist soldiers, to defect to them or not resist.The rebels failed to properly broadcast their messages effectively across the media that they controlled.They failed to capture Türksat, Turkey\'s main cable and satellite communications company, and failed to gain control of the country\'s television and mobile phone networks.This allowed Erdoğan to make his Facetime call, and to speak on television.\n\nOther scholars of civil-military relations, like Drew H. Kinney, have said reports like Luttwak and Singh\'s miss the point of their own analysis: civil resistance thwarted the coup.Luttwak argues that wayward elements of the Turkish armed forces could not silence Erdoğan.Singh says that the rebels could not project success because they couldn\'t control the message.Kinney states that neither of these reasons on their own matter, but rather it\'s their effect—civil disobedience—that is important.We might find that ""[Gülen\'s movement] ...[might] have had nothing to do with the attempted takeover in July, but civilians [nevertheless] definitely played a role in thwarting the coup,"" writes Kinney.""...[A]n unhappy civilian populace mobilized to face down the military.""\n\nErdoğan wasn\'t censored (Luttwak\'s point) and was therefore able to use FaceTime to mobilize resistance, which in turn hindered the conspirators\' ability to project success (Singh\'s point).The result is civilian resistance to soldiers, i.e., people power.The reason Singh, Luttwak, and other scholars of civil-military relations miss this is, according to Kinney, because they ""usually do not study extra-military reasons for coup failures/successes,"" but rather put a premium on ""the inner-workings of the [military] operation.""In short, they blame the military for its failure rather than acknowledge the power of the masses and their successes.\n\nPro-state forces sent text messages to every Turkish citizen calling for them to protest against the coup attempt.Throughout the night sela prayers were repeatedly called from mosque minarets across the country to encourage people to resist the coup plotters.While the sela is usually called from minarets to inform the public of a funeral, they are also traditionally performed to notify of a significant event, in this case ""to rally people"".\n\nThe coup plotters initiated their operation hours ahead of the planned time when they understood that their plans had been compromised.Had the coup been launched at its original time, the middle of the night, much of the population would have been asleep.The streets would have been mostly empty.\n\nReports have emerged, neither confirmed nor denied by Russia or Turkey that the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate intercepted signals on an imminent coup passed on to loyal Turkish operatives.The intercepted plans revealed several helicopters with commandos were on the way to Marmaris\'s coastal resort, where Erdoğan stayed, capturing or killing him.Pre-warned, Erdoğan left quickly to avoid them.\n\nAn extensive purge of the Turkish civil service began in the wake of the coup attempt, with President Erdoğan warning his opponents that ""they will pay a heavy price for this.""The New York Times along with some other Western media such as The Economist, described the purges as a ""counter-coup"", with the Times expecting the president to ""become more vengeful and obsessed with control than ever, exploiting the crisis not just to punish mutinous soldiers but to further quash whatever dissent is left in Turkey,"".As of 20 July 2016, the purge already had seen over 45,000 military officials, police officers, judges, governors and civil servants arrested or suspended, including 2,700 judges, 15,000 teachers, and every university dean in the country.\n\n163 generals and admirals were detained, around 45% of the Turkish military\'s total.\n\nOn 18 July 2016, United States State Secretary John Kerry urged Turkish authorities to halt the increasing crackdown on its citizens, indicating that the crackdown was meant to ""suppress dissent.""French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault voiced concern, warning against a ""political system which turns away from democracy"" in response to the purges.\n\nOn 17 August 2016, Turkey started releasing what was expected to eventually amount to about 38,000 prison inmates, to make more space in the penal system for detainees, numbering about 35,000, who were arrested or detained after being involved in or suspected of association, with the 2016 failed coup.\n\nOn 28 September 2016, Turkish justice minister Bekir Bozdağ said 70,000 people had been processed and 32,000 were formally arrested.\n\nMajor General Cahit Bakir, who commanded Turkish forces under NATO in Afghanistan, and Brigadier General Sener Topuc, responsible for education and aid in Afghanistan, were detained by authorities in Dubai connected with the failed coup.\n\nGeneral Akın Öztürk, former Commander of the Turkish Air Force, was the Turkish military attaché to Israel.He was arrested on charges of having played a leading role in the failed coup.Öztürk has denied the charges.\n\nGeneral Adem Huduti, the commander of the Second Army, positioned along the southern borders with Syria and Iraq, and General Erdal Öztürk, the commander of the 3rd Corps, were also arrested.\n\nRear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been stationed at NATO\'s Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk, Virginia, sought asylum in the United States after being recalled by the Turkish government.\n\nIn July 2018, Istanbul\'s 25th Criminal Court sentenced 72 former soldiers involved in the coup attempt to life in prison.\n\nOn 20 June 2019, a terrorism court in Turkey sentenced 151 people to life in prison, including General Akın Öztürk, former commander of Turkish Air Force and the most senior officer involved in the coup.128 people received ""aggravated life"" sentences, which indicates harsh conditions without parole, for their role in the coup, with another 23 receiving standard life sentences.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom President Erdoğan said as one of the principal conspirators, condemned the coup attempt and denied any role in it.""I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey,"" he said in an emailed statement reported by The New York Times.""Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force.I pray to God for Turkey, Turkish citizens, and all those currently in Turkey that this situation is resolved peacefully and quickly.As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nPresident Erdoğan asked the United States to extradite Gülen: ""I call on you again, after there was a coup attempt.Extradite this man in Pennsylvania to Turkey!If we are strategic partners or model partners, do what is necessary.""Prime Minister Yildirim has threatened war against any country that would support Gülen.Turkish Labor Minister Süleyman Soylu said that ""America is behind the coup.""\n\nRegarding the AKP\'s statement against Gülen, Secretary of State Kerry invited the Turkish government ""to present us with any legitimate evidence that withstands scrutiny,"" before they would accept an extradition request.\n\nOn 15 August 2016, former United States diplomat James Jeffrey, who was the United States ambassador to Turkey from 2008 until 2010 made the following remarks: ""The Gülen movement has some infiltration at the least in the military that I am aware of.They of course had extreme infiltration into the police and judiciary earlier.I saw that when I was in Turkey previously, particularly in the Sledgehammer case, Hakan Fidan case, and the corruption cases in 2013.Obviously, significant segment of Turkey\'s bureaucracy was infiltrated and had their allegiance to a movement.That of course is absolutely unacceptable and extremely dangerous.It likely led to the coup attempt.""\n\nOutside Turkey, in Beringen, Belgium, anti-coup protesters attempted to attack a building owned by the pro-Gülen movement group \'Vuslat\'.The police brought in a water cannon to keep the attackers at bay.In news articles it was stated that the police also protected the houses of Gülen supporters.People advocated on social media to go to Beringen once more, and there was unrest in Heusden-Zolder, elsewhere in Belgium.Furthermore, in Somalia the government ordered ""the total closure of all activities"" of an organization linked to the Gülen movement, and gave its staff seven days to leave the country.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, President Erdoğan said Western countries were ""supporting terrorism"" and the military coup, saying ""I\'m calling on the United States: what kind of strategic partners are we, that you can still host someone whose extradition I have asked for?""\n\nOn 31 January 2017, British Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, Alan Duncan said he believed the Gülen movement was responsible for the coup attempt.Duncan went on saying ""the organization which incorporated itself into the state tried to topple the democratic structure in Turkey"".\n\nIn a speech on 29 July 2016, President Erdoğan said U.S. Central Command chief Joseph Votel was ""siding with coup plotters""; Erdoğan said the United States was protecting Fethullah Gülen, whom the Turkish government blames for the coup attempt.Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim made similar comments.In response, Votel said that the Turkish government\'s statements were ""unfortunate and completely inaccurate"" and expressed concern that the mass arrests and firings of military officers would damage military cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey.Similarly, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said that the Turkish military purges were impairing the fight against ISIS.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, in an escalation of tensions with the United States, Erdoğan questioned Turkey\'s relationship with the United States and criticized the West, saying that ""script"" for the abortive putsch last month was ""written abroad"".Erdoğan stated that he had personally asked Obama to extradite Gülen to Turkey.When the U.S. government replied it would need evidence of the cleric\'s guilt before extradition, to which Erdoğan said: ""When you asked for the return of a terrorist, we did not ask for documentation. ...Let us put him on trial.""\n\nYeni Şafak daily, a Turkish pro-state newspaper, stated that the former commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, now-retired United States Army General John F. Campbell, was the ""mastermind"" behind the coup attempt in Turkey.Campbell called the statement ""absolutely ridiculous"" and President Obama said ""Any reports that we had any previous knowledge of a coup attempt, that there was any U.S. involvement in it, that we were anything other than entirely supportive of Turkish democracy are completely false, unequivocally false.""\n\nOn 1 December 2017, Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for American political analyst, former CIA official and former vice chairman of US National Intelligence Council Graham Fuller, stating his involvement in the coup.A career US State Department official who was once CIA Station Chief in Kabul and later went on to be a political scientist in Rand Corporation specializing in the Middle East, Turkish authorities said Fuller attended a meeting in Istanbul on 15 July 2016 involving organization and coordination of the botched coup.Another American among the attendance, as stated by the Turkish prosecutors, was academic Henri Barkey who was named a suspect a week after the failed coup.\n\nThe U.S. consulate in Turkey issued an advisory to U.S. citizens to avoid the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey, which houses about 50 nuclear bombs, until ""normal operations have been restored"".They stated that local authorities were denying access to the air base and that power supplying the air base was shut off.\n\nThe Incirlik base is important to the U.S.-led effort in Syria to combat ISIL and other militants.Nearly 1,500 American personnel are housed in the base.\n\nTwenty-four hours after initial reports that the air base was shut down, United States defense department officials confirmed that the base and its airspace had re-opened to military aircraft and that operations by American aircraft will resume.The Turkish commander of the air base, brig.Gen. Bekir Ercan Van was arrested.After the failure of the coup Gen Bekir Ercan Van sought asylum from the U.S., but his request was denied by U.S.\n\nFollowing the failed coup attempt multiple media outlets have published editorials advocating the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Incirlik Air base as Turkey is unstable.\n\nOn 16 July, anti-coup protesters chanted against locals in areas of Istanbul with high concentration of Alevis, including Okmeydanı and Gazi.Such incidents also occurred in a quarter of Antakya with a high Alevi population, where a motorcyclist stating to be a sharia advocate was lynched.In a neighbourhood of Ankara, shops belonging to Syrians were attacked by a mob.In Malatya, Sunni Islamists harassed residents of an Alevi neighbourhood, particularly the women, and attempted to enter the neighbourhood en masse.Police intervened and blocked all roads leading there.In Kadıköy, people drinking alcohol in public were attacked by a group of religious fundamentalists.\n\nFollowing the arrests, thousands of anti-coup protesters demanded instituting the death penalty against detainees connected with the coup, chanting ""we want the death penalty"".President Erdoğan has been open to reinstituting the death penalty, noting that ""in a democracy, whatever the people want they will get.""Turkish authorities have not executed anyone since 1984, but legally abolished capital punishment only in 2004 as a pre-condition to join the European Union.\n\nEuropean Union officials have been vocal about their opposition to purges by Turkish authorities in connection to the coup.French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that Turkey must work within the framework of the law to uphold Europe\'s democratic principles.Furthermore, on 18 July 2016, Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of Foreign Affairs of the European Union, announced that no country will be admitted into the European Union ""if it introduces the death penalty"".Moreover, German press secretary, Steffen Seibert, stated that reinstituting the death penalty will end Turkey\'s accession talks with the European Union.\n\nTurkey is a member of the Council of Europe, and ratified the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) as part of its terms of membership.The ECHR is an international treaty that includes the abolition of the death penalty among its terms.As such, Turkey is legally bound not to reintroduce the death penalty.\n\nOn 20 July 2016, President Erdoğan announced a three-month state of emergency in response to the attempted coup, invoking Article 120 of the Constitution of Turkey (""Declaration of state of emergency because of widespread acts of violence and serious deterioration of public order"").Under the state of emergency, under Article 121, ""the Council of Ministers, meeting under the chairpersonship of the President of the Republic, may issue decrees having the force of law on matters necessitated by the state of emergency"", with decrees subject to subsequent parliamentary approval.The state of emergency was endorsed by the Parliament on 21 July by 346 votes to 115.The Justice and Development Party and the Nationalist Movement Party supported the state of emergency, whilst the Republican People\'s Party and the Peoples\' Democratic Party opposed it.Prime Minister Yıldırım said at the Parliament that the state of emergency was necessary to ""get rid of this scourge rapidly"".\n\nAs part of the state of emergency, deputy prime minister Kurtulmuş announced that Turkey was temporarily suspending part of the European Convention on Human Rights following the attempted coup, invoking Article 15 of the Convention (""war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation"").The suspensions must be notified to the Council of Europe and may not affect the right to a fair trial or the prohibition on torture.\n\nThis state of emergency in Turkey as well as the hindrance of the right to protest that occurred within such framework have been layered onto a longer history of emergency rules, oppressive legislation and daily government practice that have reinforced both.We can see from this the ""autocratisation"" process in Turkey has thrived of existing legal framework deeply associated in legacies of past ""emergencies"".\n\nOn 3 October 2016 Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş declared the governments intention to extend the state of emergency by a further three months raising objections from both the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) and Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) were critical of the governments use of their emergency powers and declared that they would vote against an extension.\n\nFollowing the National Security Council\'s recommendation for the extension President Erdoğan stated that it was possible that the state of emergency could last for longer than a year prompting outcry from the opposition, Leader of the Main Opposition Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu said that ""The president saying that the state of emergency can last longer than 12 months is strengthening the fear of a counter-coup"" and that it was ""raising the prospect of opportunist measures.""\n\nThe AKP\'s governmental majority allowed the three-month extension to take effect on 19 October 2016.The two-year-long state of emergency was ended on 19 July 2018.\n\nOn 16 July 2016, the media reported that eight Turkish military personnel of various ranks had landed in Greece\'s northeastern city of Alexandroupolis on board a Black Hawk helicopter and claimed political asylum in Greece.While the Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu demanded extradition of ""the eight traitors as soon as possible"", the Greek authorities stated: ""We will follow the procedures of international law.However, we give severe considerations to the fact that [the Turkish military men] are accused, in their own country, of violating the constitutional order and trying to overthrow democracy.""The helicopter was returned to Turkey shortly thereafter.The eight asylum seekers, their asylum case pending, were later transferred to Athens, mainly for safety reasons.On 26 January, the Supreme Court of Greece eventually ruled against their extradition, on the grounds that the eight were unlikely to face a fair trial if returned to their home country and due to concerns over their safety.\n\nOn 15 February 2017, five Turkish commandos illegally entered Greece through the Evros river.However, once they entered the country, the group split.The two of them surrendered to the police and on 20 February 2017, requested political asylum.They were being held in the city of Alexandroupolis.The two men belonged to the Turkish navy.The names given by the two reportedly match the names of two fugitives wanted in relation to the shadowy operation against Erdoğan himself.The Greek government mentioned that the Greek authorities will not allow the country to be dragged into the ongoing feud between the Turkish state and the followers of Gulen.But there were no sign of the other three.According to a lawyer there were indications that the other three have been arrested by Greek authorities who were about to expel them to Turkey.According to new evidence and new information these three ""arrested"" marines were delivered under fast and informal procedures from Greek to Turkish services.\n\nAfter the coup attempt, two Turkish military attachés in Athens, Staff Col. İlhan Yaşıtlı and naval attaché Col. Halis Tunç, had reportedly disappeared along with their families.The Greek foreign ministry canceled the two attachés\' accreditations on 7 August 2016, upon the request of the Turkish foreign ministry.Greek media reported that they might have fled to Italy.On 11 August 2016, the Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu confirmed the reports saying that they had left Greece for Italy on 6 August and adding that Turkey would officially ask the Italian authorities to extradite the two soldiers.\n\nOn 9 August 2016, the media reported that Turkey\'s Rear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been on a United States-based assignment for NATO and after the coup was subject to a detention order in Turkey, had sought asylum in the United States.\n\nIn mid-November 2016, it was officially confirmed that about 40 Turkish military servicemen of various ranks stationed at NATO command structures had applied for asylum in Germany and Belgium.\n\nIn January 2017, Der Spiegel magazine and ARD broadcaster reported that about 40 mostly high-ranking Turkish soldiers who worked at NATO facilities in Germany requested asylum in Germany.\n\nAt the end of February 2017, Germany said it had received 136 asylum requests from Turks holding diplomatic passports since the July coup attempt.The figure was a total for August 2016 to January 2017; some were presumed to be military officers posted to NATO bases in Germany.\n\nIn November 2016, NATO\'s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that Turkish NATO Officers had requested asylum in the countries where they had been posted.He did not name the nations involved or the number of officers, saying it was a matter for those countries to decide.He said: ""Some Turkish officers working in NATO command structure ... have requested asylum in the countries where they are working. ...As always, this is an issue that is going to be assessed and decided by the different NATO allies as a national issue.""\n\nAs of March 2017, Norway have granted asylum for four Turkish soldiers and a military attache.\n\nSeveral Turkish citizens with diplomatic passports have sought political asylum in Switzerland.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, detainees in Turkey have been denied access to legal counsel, have been beaten and tortured.They have not been provided with adequate food, water, or medical care.At least one has attempted suicide.Amnesty International wanted the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture to send people to check on detainees conditions.A person who had been on duty at the Ankara police headquarters said that police denied medical treatment to a detainee.""Let him die.We will say he came to us dead,"" the witness quoted a police doctor as saying.\n\nAlso, Erdoğan has extended the maximum period of detention for suspects from four days to 30, a move Amnesty said increased the risk of torture or other maltreatment of detainees.\n\nTurkish Justice Ministry denied the reports and the Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said on his Twitter account: ""There has not been any torture or assault of detainees in custody,"" in response to reports by Amnesty International.""The claims of torture and assault make up a pre-packaged misinformation campaign formed by members of FETÖ, one which is untrue and distorted,""\n\nOn 7 August, between three and five million people gathered for an anti-coup rally organized by the Turkish authorities in Istanbul.President Erdoğan and the two leaders of the major opposition parties (the Republican People\'s Party and the Nationalist Movement Party) were present.\n\nGreek authorities on several Aegean islands have called for emergency measures to curtail a growing flow of refugees from Turkey; the number of migrants and refugees willing to make the journey across the Aegean has increased noticeably after the failed coup.At Athens officials voiced worries because Turkish monitors overseeing the deal in Greece had been abruptly pulled out after the failed coup without being replaced.Also, the mayor of Kos expressed concern in a letter to the Greek Prime Minister citing the growing influx of refugees and migrants after the failed coup.The Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises (SETE) warned about the prospect of another flare-up in the refugee/migrant crisis due to the Turkish political instability.\n\nVincent Cochetel, the director of the Europe Bureau of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in August 2016 that parts of the EU-Turkey deal about immigration were already de facto suspended because no Turkish police were present at Greek detention centres to oversee deportations.\n\nOn 25 August 2016, seven Turkish citizens sought asylum in Greece.Two were university professors, and their two children applied for asylum in Alexandroupoli after they illegally entered the country from the northeastern border.Also, three businessmen illegally reached the Greek island of Rhodes, and they also applied for asylum.\n\nOn 30 August 2016, a Turkish judge arrived at the Greek island of Chios on a migrant boat, with six Syrian nationals, and sought asylum in the country.He told the Greek coastguard and police officers that he is being persecuted in Turkey for his political beliefs by President Tayyip Erdoğan.The Turkish judge had been arrested for illegally entering the country and was transferred to Athens for his asylum proceedings.The Syrian nationals claimed refugee status.\n\nOn 11 September 2016, four Turkish civilians were arrested by Turkish police.An academic and a teacher attempted to escape to Greece illegally by crossing the Evros river, and the other two because they organized the escape attempt.The academic and the teacher paid a total of 12,500 euros in Istanbul to arrange their escape to Greece.Before their attempt, both the academic and the teacher were suspended from their duties as part of the ongoing probe into the failed coup attempt.Police also seized an air raft, an oar and a pump while detaining the suspects.The court later ordered the two\'s release while the other two suspects, who organized the escape attempt, were arrested.\n\nOn 21 September 2016, ten Turkish civilians, two men, two women and six children landed by boat illegally on the Greek island of Rhodes and sought asylum.They told the Greek authorities they were working in the private sector in Turkey and the Turkish government was persecuting them due to their political beliefs.\n\nOn 29 September 2016, five Turkish nationals, a couple and their child and two other men, arrived in Greece, at Alexandroupolis by crossing the Evros River by boat illegally and requested political asylum.\n\nOn 12 December 2016, one female Turkish national, landed by boat, full of refugees and immigrants, illegally on the Greek island of Lesbos.She requested political asylum.\n\nOn 24 October 2017, Turkish authorities obtained information that 995 Turks have applied for asylum in Greece after the coup attempt.\n\nMore than 1,800 Turkish citizens requested asylum in Greece in 2017.\n\nOn 18 February 2018, seventeen Turkish nationals, including six children, requested asylum in Greece at Oinousses island.\n\nIn August 2018, the former lawmaker for the Peoples\' Democratic Party, Leyla Birlik, requested asylum in Greece after illegally crossing the border near Alexandroupolis.\n\nBerlin mayor, Michael Müller (SPD), said Turkey was waging war on supporters of the Gülen movement in Germany.He said that Turkish officials had approached him and asked him whether he would be prepared to confront the Gülen movement in Berlin critically and, if necessary, to support measures against it.The mayor rejected the idea and made it very clear that Turkish conflicts could not be waged in the city.\n\nDer Spiegel presented classified documents, which showed that Turkey\'s secret service (MIT) had asked Germany\'s foreign intelligence agency (BND) for help in rounding up Gülen supporters in Germany.The Turkish secret service wanted the BND to use its influence to spur German lawmakers into taking action against Gülen supporters and extraditing them to Turkey.Also, Turkey\'s government has sent German authorities requests for searches and extraditions linked to supporters of Fethullah Gülen in Germany.\n\nIn Germany businesses thought to be in support of the Gülen movement have been harassed by Erdoğan supporters.\n\nAfter the failed coup, there was a massive demonstration in Cologne at Germany, in late July, in support of Turkish President Erdoğan.Erdoğan wanted to address the participants via video but was rejected by the local authorities and the German Constitutional Court due to security concerns.Turkey said that the ban was unacceptable and a violation of freedom of expression.\n\nGerman authorities said Turkish mosques in Germany were playing Turkish politics and worried that Turkey\'s internal politics spilled over into German cities.For years, German authorities had encouraged Turkey\'s state-run religious institution Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs usually referred to as DİTİB to provide Islamic preachers and teachers and Gülen Movement Schools for the large Turkish diaspora in Germany.DİTİB manages some 900 mosques in Germany.Gülen movement runs 100 educational facilities in Germany.\n\nAfter the failed coup DİTİB published a sermon praising ""our noble nation"" for rising against ""a wretched network"" that had sown ""seeds of sedition, rebellion and hostility.""According to Volker Beck, a member of the center-left Greens in Germany\'s Bundestag, ""That was not a religious text.It was a declaration of obedience to Mr. Erdoğan and his measures since the coup attempt,"" Volker Kauder, parliamentary group leader of the Germany\'s ruling Christian Democrats, the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU)/Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) faction, said Turkish-Germans should be loyal to Germany first and foremost.\n\nGermans of Turkish origin are being pressured in Germany by informers and officers of Turkey\'s MIT spy agency.According to reports Turkey had 6,000 informants plus MIT officers in Germany who were putting pressure on ""German Turks"".Hans-Christian Ströbele said that there was an ""unbelievable"" level of ""secret activities"" in Germany by Turkey\'s MIT agency.According to Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, not even the former communist East German Stasi secret police had managed to run such a large ""army of agents"" in the former West Germany: ""Here, it\'s not just about intelligence gathering, but increasingly about intelligence service repression.""\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nGermany\'s Office for Migration and Refugees said on 18 November 2016, it had received 4,437 political asylum requests from Turkish citizens up to October, compared to 1,767 for the whole of last year.""We must expect that the number of Turks who are seeking political asylum in Germany will continue to rise,"" said Stephan Mayer, the domestic policy speaker of the union coalition in the Bundestag.\n\nOn 10 December 2016, eleven Turkish nationals, 10 adults and one child, in a martial arts group have applied for asylum in Germany.\n\nAs of January 2018, Germany was first place and Greece second as EU destinations of choice for Turkish nationals requesting asylum after the coup attempt.\n\nTurkish police have carried out simultaneous raids in 18 cities against companies associated with United States-based Fethullah Gülen.The state-run Anadolu Agency said police searched 204 premises and detained 187 businessmen for ""membership in a terror organization"" and ""providing financial support to a terror organization"".All suspects\' assets were seized.\n\nWikiLeaks released Turkish emails and documents to respond to the Turkish government\'s purges that followed the coup attempt.In turn, the Turkish Telecommunications Communications Board blocked access to the WikiLeaks website.On 17 July 2016 Wikileaks had announced on Twitter, the leak of approximately 300,000 emails and over 500,000 documents, including those to and from AKP.\n\nWikiLeaks stated that it was attacked shortly after 17 July announcement of the planned publication and hypothesized that Turkish authorities were responsible.WikiLeaks stated in a tweet, ""our infrastructure is under sustained attack.""Tweets from WikiLeaks include ""We are unsure of the true origin of the attack.The timing suggests a Turkish state power faction or its allies.We will prevail & publish.""and: ""Turks will likely be censored to prevent them reading our pending release of 100k+ docs on politics leading up to the coup."", ""We ask that Turks are ready with censorship bypassing systems such as TorBrowser and uTorrent""; ""And that everyone else is ready to help them bypass censorship and push our links through the censorship to come.""\n\nUpon the release of the email dump, it has been reported that the emails contain little to no damning information, and instead are just mails from a public mailing list, but also linked externally to ""voter information on all of the women registered to vote in 78 out of Turkey\'s 81 provinces"".\n\nSeveral places were renamed to commemorate the failed coup: Boğaziçi Köprüsü (Bosphorus Bridge) → 15 Temmuz Şehitler Köprüsü Kızılay Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Kızılay Demokrasi Meydanı Ahmet Taner Kışlalı Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Milli İrade Meydanı (Reverted to original name a few days later) Büyük İstanbul Otogarı → İstanbul 15 Temmuz Demokrasi Otogarı In TRT, Yeni Haber Stüdyosu → 15 Temmuz Millet Stüdyosu Kazan → Kahramankazan about the province\'s local people\'s resistance to the coup plotters.Kahraman means ""hero"" in Turkish Niğde University → Niğde Ömer Halisdemir University\n\nIn 2018, the Istanbul Municipal Council decided to change the names of a total of 90 streets that included words which could be associated with FETÖ.\n\nThe Presidency of Religious Affairs stated that it would not be providing religious funeral services to the dead coupists, except for ""privates and low-ranking officers compelled by force and threats who found themselves in the midst of the conflict without full knowledge of anything"".\n\nA document dated 26 September 2016 showed that Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) asked Turkish missions and religious representatives abroad to profile Gülen movement expatriates living in their respective foreign countries.Gülen-linked schools, businesses, foundations, associations, media outlets and others were also included in the reports.Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs has gathered intelligence via imams from 38 countries.\n\nBelgium officials said they would withdraw recognition of Diyanet mosques in the country if necessary.\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nOn 21 December 2016, the Turkish government has recalled Yusuf Acar, the religious affairs attaché of the Turkish Embassy in the Netherlands, after Dutch authorities said he was spying.Acar collected information of people who sympathize with Fethullah Gülen at Netherlands and passed it on to the Turkish authorities.The Dutch government called spying activities an ""unwanted and non-acceptable interference in the lives of Dutch citizens.""and the attaché was reportedly declared persona non grata and received a ""deportation warning"" by Dutch authorities.\n\nOn 26 January 2017, President Erdoğan, during his visit to Tanzania, asked his Tanzanian counterpart John Magufuli to take action against the network of Fethullah Gülen.\n\nIn April 2017 it was announced that President Erdoğan planned to establish a purpose-built museum dedicated to the coup events, called the ""Museum of the 15 July: Martyrs and Democracy"", to be located in Kahramankazan, a town near Ankara.Paid for by Turkish Ministry of Culture funds, it is planned to open at the end of 2018.The museum opened in December 2019\n\nAmong the Turkish opposition parties, the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) issued a statement expressing their public opposition to the coup, and the Hürriyet Daily News reported that Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bahçeli telephoned Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım to express his opposition to the coup.The co-chairs of the opposition Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) issued a statement saying that the party was ""under all circumstances and as a matter of principle against all kinds of coup.""Amongst the minor parties, left-wing nationalist Patriotic Party\'s Doğu Perinçek backed democracy, when he held Gülen and the Americans responsible.Kurdish militant separatist organization Kurdistan Workers\' Party, which Turkey and its allies label as a terrorist organization, urged their supporters to stay away from the coup and rather defend their people, while the Communist Party called upon the people to overthrow the AKP government which they called an ""enemy of humanity"".\n\nDuring the first hours of the coup plotters\' moves of blocking Istanbul\'s bridges and flying fighter jets low over Istanbul and Ankara, Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjørn Jagland tweeted against the coup attempt and underlined that ""any attempt to overthrow the democratically elected leaders is unacceptable"".\n\nRussia\'s President Vladimir Putin called Erdoğan out of solidarity before all NATO member countries\' heads following the coup attempt.Erdoğan thanked the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev – who was the first president to show solidarity after the coup attempt – for his support in solving the 7-month crisis over downed Russian Sukhoi Su-24 and the Prime Minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, who was among the first NATO country leaders to condemn the coup attempt, already from the early hours of Saturday.\n\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the then prime minister of Pakistan, was all praise for the people of Turkey and the AKP government and strongly condemned what he termed as an attempt to undermine democracy in Turkey.""We deeply admire the resolve of the brave and resilient Turkish people, who stood up against the forces of darkness and anarchy to express their support and commitment to democracy,"" the PM said in a statement issued from his office.\n\nThe majority of countries either expressed their support for the government or called for restraint.On 16 July 2016, however, a proposed United Nations Security Council statement denouncing the coup was not accepted by Egypt, a non-permanent member of the Council at the time, due to textual disagreements.Egyptian diplomats said that the council is ""in no position to qualify, or label [the Turkish] government – or any other government for that matter – as democratically elected or not"".Objection by the United States and the UK – permanent members of the Security Council – led to Egypt proposing a new statement calling for all sides to ""respect the democratic and constitutional principles and the rule of law"", which was rejected, preventing the condemnation of the coup attempt by the Security Council.The leader of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky supported the coup attempt.\n\nAl-Monitor reported that ""Unlike Ankara\'s Western allies, Iran did not wait for the coup\'s failure to speak up.Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif voiced support for democracy in a Twitter message in the early hours of the unrest, writing ""Stability, and democracy in Turkey are paramount"".In a subsequent phone call after the failure of the coup attempt, President Hassan Rouhani told Erdoğan the coup attempt was ""a test to identify your domestic and foreign friends and enemies.""An Iranian official pointed out parallels between the coup attempt in Turkey and the coup against Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mussadiq in 1953: ""What we know is that this attempt was triggered by foreign hands.We have experienced the same thing in the past.Since Mr. Erdogan wants to play a more positive path in the region today, they want to overthrow him.""\n\nMustafa Akıncı, President of Northern Cyprus, welcomed the fact that ""no community in Turkey ... applauded the coup as they have done in the past.""Azerbaijan strongly condemned the attempted military coup in Turkey and considered such actions unacceptable according to a statement from Novruz Mammadov, deputy head of the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration and chief of the foreign relations department.\n\nEuropean Commissioner dealing with Turkey\'s EU membership bid, Johannes Hahn, said it appears Turkey\'s government prepared arrest lists of political opponents before the coup attempt and had been waiting for the right time to act.In this sense, EU reported that as a main criticism to put this issue in the category of terrorism become the violation of the fundamental rights and fundamental values of the citizens.Hence, it underlines a total divergence of opinions and mentality between EU and Turkey which reached a deadlock here especially after the 15th of July in 2016.\n\nOn 19 July 2016, White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said during a press briefing that President Barack Obama has held a phone conversation with President Erdoğan: ""The President used the phone call to reiterate once again the strong commitment of the United States to the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey.The President pledged any needed assistance to the Turkish government as they conduct an investigation to determine exactly what happened.""\n\nOn 20 July 2016, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""Turkey has a large armed force, professional armed forces and ...I am certain they will continue as a committed and strong NATO ally.""On a statement released on 10 August 2016, the Secretary General once more strongly condemned the attempted coup and reiterated full support for Turkey\'s democratic institutions.He also expressed support for the elected Turkish government and respect for the courage of the Turkish people for resisting the coup plotters.\n\nOn 29 July 2016, the commander of U.S. Central Command, General Joseph Votel, denied statements by Turkey\'s president Erdoğan that he has supported the coup attempt in Turkey.\n\nOn 1 August 2016, United States Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, General Joseph Dunford, visited Turkey and condemned the coup attempt.Dunford said: ""The consistent theme throughout the day was a reaffirmation of the importance of the U.S.-Turkey relationship – the need for us to cooperate.""\n\nOn July, 20, there were reports that a group of Turkish military commandos coup fugitives would try to cross from Turkey to the island of Symi, in the southeastern Aegean, at Greece.The Hellenic Coast Guard was on alert and increased the patrols in the area, especially after a group of inflatable dinghies and other vessels were seen departing from Datça, on the Turkish coast, in the direction of Symi, they monitored the movements of the Turkish vessels, which remained in Turkish waters.Furthermore, a contingent of the Hellenic Police was dispatched to Symi to conduct checks there.The Greek government had been anticipating a possible attempt by participants in the failed coup to come to Greece and took the reports seriously.Turkish F-16 fighter jets were also scrambled to check reports that missing Turkish coast guard vessels had appeared in Greek waters in the Aegean.Later on the day, the Turkish interior ministry denied reports that rebel soldiers might have ""hijacked"" a vessel to flee to Greece.The Greek armed forces remained on alert the throughout the day for potential coup fugitives.\n\nAccording to Michael Rubin, from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Erdoğan had himself to blame for the coup.Following an increasingly Islamist agenda, Erdoğan had reportedly ""dropped any pretense of governing for all Turks.""After ""fanning the flames"" at the 2013 Gezi Park protests, he transformed the predominantly Kurdish-inhabited areas of southeastern Turkey ""into a war zone reminiscent of the worst days of the 1980s.""The biggest problem, according to Rubin, might have been Erdoğan\'s foreign policy, which managed to turn the initial ""no problems with neighbors"" doctrine into a situation where the country has problems with almost every neighbor and has even alienated some of its allies and friends.Rubin previously worked as an official at the Pentagon and less than 4 months before the coup, he wrote an article in Newsweek magazine titled, ""Will There Be a Coup Against Erdogan in Turkey?""\n\nBritish Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk warned that ""too late did Erdoğan realize the cost of the role he had chosen for his country.It\'s one thing to say sorry to Putin and patch up relations with Netanyahu; but when you can no longer trust your army, there are more serious matters to concentrate upon.""Even if this coup may have failed, Fisk expected another to follow in the months or years to come.\n\nTurkish professor Akın Ünver described the coup d\'état attempt as ""more of a mutiny"".\n\nThe name of the ""Peace at Home Council"" – Yurtta Sulh Konseyi – is derived from Atatürk\'s famous saying \'Peace at Home, Peace in the World\'.Journalist Ezgi Başaran said that ""the statement of the junta, that was [...] read on the [...] government TV [channel] as the coup got under way, bore a strong resemblance to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk\'s famous address to the Turkish Youth.[...] On the other hand, given that these references are too obvious, they may have been intentionally included to insinuate a Kemalist junta rather than a Gülenist one.""\n\nThe citizen journalism site Bellingcat published an analysis of the messages of a WhatsApp group consisting of high-ranking military officials who had taken part in the coup covering their activities including them killing several people.The messages were cross referenced with video footage.The group was named ""Yurtta sulh"" which refers to a peace at home speech and they seem secular and military with no references to Gülen or anything related during the several hours of messaging.\n\nNews reports have suggested that the coup ringleader was Adil Öksüz.Some believe Öksüz to have been an operative with Turkish intelligence.\n\nGerman Islamic studies scholar said the putschists tried to forestall a large-scale purge of judiciary and military, the implementation of which had already started on Saturday, the day after the coup attempt.According to Turkish investigative journalist Ahmet Şık, a list of officials to be purged had been ready compiled by the attorney-general of Izmir, Okan Bato, and was approved by President Erdoğan.According to this version, the putschists had to quickly bring forward their coup attempt before being disposed and arrested.\n\nDuring and after the events, several politicians and commentators suggested that the government knew about the coup in advance and possibly directed it.The facts that the coup attempt began in the evening rather than at a more inconspicuous time and that the events were largely confined to Ankara and Istanbul contributed to doubts about the authenticity of the coup attempt.Journalists and opposition politicians branded it a \'tragic comedy\' and \'theatre play\'.Advocates of such theories pointed to how Erdoğan stood to gain from the coup attempt in terms of increasing his popularity and support for his calls for an executive presidency, while being able to legitimize further crackdowns on judicial independence and the opposition in general.\n\nOther elements that were reported to support the theory included: no list of demands by the coup plotters, the organization and response of the police, the long lists of arrests that seemed to be ready surprisingly quickly (including arrests of 2,745 judges and 2,839 soldiers), and the obvious nature of the coup actions.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom Erdoğan had said as being one of the principal conspirators, commented, ""I don\'t believe that the world believes the accusations made by President Erdoğan.There is a possibility that it could be a staged coup and it could be meant for further accusations [against the Gülenists].""Journalist Cengiz Çandar, a veteran observer of Turkey\'s coups, said ""I have never seen any with this magnitude of such inexplicable sloppiness.""Prominent Hizmet (Gülen movement) spokesman Alp Aslandogan said, referencing that the Turkish Air Force commander met with Erdoğan before 15 July, that certain legal documentation related to the coup seemed written beforehand, arguing that within ""the indictment written by a prosecutor on the night of 15 July to 16 July, there were events there that didn\'t actually happen.Some events did happen, but those events didn\'t happen by the time the document started.It looks like a bigger plan was there, and part of the plan did not come to pass.""\n\nThe organization and spontaneous synchronization by large numbers of mosques was perceived to be unachievable unless there had been prior preparation, with journalists also pointing to how Erdoğan could have strategically used the call to prayer to invoke religious sentiment in a political situation as a veiled attack on state secularism.\n\nThousands of arrests and purges were conducted by Turkish authorities between 16 and 18 July 2016.The sheer number of these arrests made at such a speed could only be done so if the ""Turkish government had all those lists ready"", as suggested by Johannes Hahn, European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, on 18 July 2016.Hahn also said that because these lists were already available immediately after the coup, the ""event was prepared"" and the lists were to be used ""at a certain stage"".\n\nMehmet Dişli, who was seen giving orders to the coup plotters and who was the one who put a belt around Hulusi Akar\'s neck to make him sign, is the brother of Şaban Dişli, a former vice president of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and confidant of Erdoğan.\n\nSeveral social media users have compared the coup attempt to the Reichstag fire in 1933, which Adolf Hitler used as an excuse to suspend civil liberties and order mass arrests of his opponents.Politico correspondent Ryan Heath said that ""the coup was staged to allow Erdoğan to purge the military of opponents and increase his grip on the country"".Heath used Twitter to share comments from his Turkish source, who called the events of Friday night a ""fake coup"" which would help a ""fake democracy warrior"" (referring to Erdoğan).The source said: ""Probably we\'ll see an early election [in] which he\'ll try to guarantee an unbelievable majority of the votes.And this will probably guarantee another 10–15 years of authoritarian, elected dictatorship.""\n\nThe New York Times reported that some Turkish citizens believed the coup attempt was staged by Erdoğan to improve his public image and popularity, while cracking down on political opponents and expanding his power.Critics found it suspect that reportedly no government officials were arrested or harmed during the attempted coup, which—among other factors—raised the suspicion of a false flag event staged by the Turkish government to crack down on opposition parties.Those in Turkey suggesting that the coup was staged are also being questioned by the government.\n\nPoliticians and journalists who were skeptical of the authenticity of the coup plot said that in reality, a \'civil coup\' had effectively been staged against the Armed Forces and Judiciary, both of which were extensively purged of stated Gülen supporters by the government shortly after the events.Skeptics said that the coup would be used as an excuse for further erosion of judicial independence and a crackdown on the opposition, giving the AKP greater and unstoppable power over all state institutions and paving the way for a more radical Islamist agenda at odds with the founding principles of the Turkish Republic.\n\nJustice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said in late July 2016 that Turkish social media users who said the government was staging the coup faced investigation: ""Just look at the people who are saying on social media that this was theatre.Public prosecutors are already investigating them.Most of them are losers who think it is an honor to die for Fethullah Gülen\'s command.""\n\nOn 12 July 2017, Stockholm Center for Freedom, a monitoring group with reported links to the Gülen movement, published a controversial report stating that President Erdogan orchestrated the coup bid as a false flag to consolidate his powers, set up his opposition for a mass persecution, and push Turkish Armed Forces into a military incursion into Syria.According to the report, it uncovered new evidence from 11 July 2016, four days before the planned coup bid, that a secret plan was circulated among select group of Armed Forces to give an appearance of a coup attempt.The plan was sanctioned by intelligence and military chiefs with the approval of Erdogan.\n\nIn early November 2017, Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for , former Director of the Middle East Program of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, stating that he is an agent of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), that he was present in Istanbul during the 2016 Turkish coup attempt, and that he was one of the key organizers behind the coup attempt.Around 1 December, the Istanbul prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for Graham E. Fuller, an American author and political analyst specializing in Islamic extremism after a long CIA career and holding the role of vice-chair of the United States National Intelligence Council.The prosecutor\'s office based the warrant on suspicion of Fuller helping to plan the coup attempt.Hürriyet stated that Turkish authorities believed that they had traced Fuller\'s location before the attempted coup and afterward when he left Turkey.\n\nBarkey denied his reported role in the coup, describing the claims as ""so ludicrous that they do not even deserve the term \'science fiction\'.""\n\nDeep state in Turkey The Imam\'s Army List of coups and coup attempts since 2010 List of modern conflicts in the Middle East List of attacks on legislatures\n', 'Claim_Context': 'In March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.

103,"{'Wiki_Title': '2016 Turkish coup attempt', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'On 15 July 2016, a faction within the Turkish Armed Forces, organized as the Peace at Home Council, attempted a coup d\'état against state institutions, including the government and president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.They attempted to seize control of several places in Ankara, Istanbul, Marmaris and elsewhere, such as the Asian side entrance of the Bosphorus Bridge, but failed to do so after forces and civilians loyal to the state defeated them.The Council cited an erosion of secularism, elimination of democratic rule, disregard for human rights, and Turkey\'s loss of credibility in the international arena as reasons for the coup.The government said it had evidence the coup leaders were linked to the Gülen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the Republic of Turkey and led by Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish businessman and a well-known Islamic scholar who lives in exile in Pennsylvania.The Turkish government alleged that Gülen was behind the coup (which Gülen denied) and that the United States was harboring him.Events surrounding the coup attempt and the purges in its aftermath reflect a complex power struggle between Islamist elites in Turkey.\n\nDuring the coup attempt, over 300 people were killed and more than 2,100 were injured.Many government buildings, including the Turkish Parliament and the Presidential Palace, were bombed from the air.Mass arrests followed, with at least 40,000 detained, including at least 10,000 soldiers and 2,745 judges, for being affiliated with the coup attempt.15,000 education staff were also suspended and the licenses of 21,000 teachers working at private institutions were revoked after the government stated they were loyal to Gülen.More than 77,000 people have been arrested and over 160,000 fired from their jobs, on reports of connections to Gülen.\n\nThere were many reactions against the coup attempt, both domestically and internationally.The main opposition parties in Turkey condemned the attempt, while several international leaders—such as those of the United States, NATO, the European Union, and neighboring countries—called for ""respect of the democratic institutions in Turkey and its elected officials.""Many international organizations also opposed the coup.The United Nations Security Council, however, did not denounce the coup after disagreements over the phrasing of a statement.Iran opposed the coup and advised Erdogan to defeat the coup plotters.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the head of United States Central Command, General Joseph Votel, was ""siding with coup plotters"", after Votel criticized the Turkish government for arresting the Pentagon\'s contacts in Turkey.\n\nIn March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.The same month, the British Parliament\'s Foreign Affairs Select Committee said some Gulenists were involved in the coup d\'état attempt but found no hard evidence that Fethullah Gülen masterminded the failed coup and found no evidence to justify the United Kingdom designating the Gülen movement as a ""terrorist organization"".\n\nSince the 1970s, followers of the influential cleric Fethullah Gülen had assumed increasingly important positions within the Turkish state apparatus.Gülen several times advised his followers to take key positions in society and government, if necessary with a secret identity to avoid opposition from the laicistic Turkish army and government.Nevertheless, at the start of the 21st century, Gülen\'s followers achieved crucial positions of power in Turkey (and beyond) with a vast network of newspapers, TV channels, schools, associations, lobby organizations, financial institutions and positions within the state such as the army and the judiciary.Initially, the then Prime Minister Erdogan seemingly tolerated the power of the Gülen movement because of common interests such as limiting the undemocratic political power of the military, but also because of impotence and fear of Gülen\'s power within Turkey.\n\nA series of events eventually led to a rift between Erdogan and Gülen.For example, prosecutors that allegedly were aligned with the Gülen movement tried to arrest the intelligence chief Hakan Fidan for the peace negotiations with the PKK, and by extension PM Erdogan subsequently, as the Turkish secret service is directly subordinate to the prime minister of Turkey.During this period (2010-2013), state secrets were leaked, fraud was committed with the entrance exams for government employees (KPSS), a change of power occurred at the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) and (sex)tapes of both government members and opposition members were leaked.Following these events and other incidents, the Turkish government decided to designate the Gülen movement as parallel state and FETÖ (Fethullahist Terror Organization).Alleged Gülen supporters were fired or arrested.The coup attempt that followed is therefore also described by some analysts as a last desperate attempt by Gülenists to retain power.\n\nIt is widely reported that Kemalist ideology played a huge role in motivating the 15 July 2016 coup attempt, like all previous political interventions in the history of Turkey\'s military coups.Since the establishment of multiparty democracy in Turkey in 1946, the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), together with the judiciary, have viewed themselves as guardians of Kemalist ideals and the secular Turkish nationalist state established under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk against political parties that have promoted a larger role for Islam and minorities in public life.The military and judiciary have regularly intervened in politics to block or ban popular parties representing conservative Muslim Turks, attempting to relax the restrictions on traditional religious practices, such as women\'s wearing of headscarves.The military has toppled four elected governments: by coups in 1960 and 1980, and by military decisions in 1971 and 1997.The military has also banned several major political parties.In 1998, Erdoğan, then-mayor of Istanbul, was banned for life from politics and jailed because he had read a religious poem by Ziya Gökalp several years before, at a public meeting.In 2007, the military expressed its opposition to the election of Abdullah Gül, of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), as president, by issuing an e-memorandum.Still, Gül was eventually elected when the AKP won both a referendum on the matter.Also, a snap election, and the party returned with a larger majority in the parliament.The military cited erosion of secularism as one of the reasons for the coup in the statement published on the day of the coup.\n\nAs opposed to previous political interventions by the Turkish military, Turkey\'s AKP government and pro-state media maintain that the 15 July 2016 coup attempt was not motivated by allegiance to Kemalist ideology, but rather to the vast political, economic, and religious network led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen.Between 2007 and 2012, high-profile Kemalists, including high-ranking officers of the Turkish Armed Forces, faced a series of trials and purges, under reports of involvement in a secret society codenamed ""Ergenekon.""Supported by Islamist (both pro-Gülen and pro-Erdoğan) prosecutors, security officials, and media, the purges allowed lower-rank Islamist officers to assume high-ranking military positions.They were seen as a bid by Turkey\'s civilian leaders under President Erdoğan to establish dominance over the military.In these trials in 2013 – viewed as ""sensational"" and ""one of the biggest in recent Turkish history"" – 275 people, including senior military officers, journalists, lawyers, and academics, were said to be involved in the so-called ""Ergenekon"" conspiracy, reportedly plotting a coup in 2003/04 against then–Prime Minister Erdoğan.Additionally, some military officers were said to be involved in a separate reported plot, Sledgehammer.Simultaneously, Erdoğan promoted lower-ranking officers up the chain of command, ensuring that the military chief of staff was loyal to him and thereby demoralizing the army.\n\nThe AKP\'s alliance with Gülen started to collapse during 2013 as Gülenists targeted the AKP using corruption charges.After the split, Erdoğan decided it would be advantageous to rehabilitate the army.The ""Ergenekon"" convictions were overturned in April 2016 by the Court of Cassation, which ruled that the existence of the network was unproven.\n\nIn 2013, law enforcement efforts to fight corruption, which had led to the 2013 corruption scandal in Turkey, were faulted by Erdoğan.The anti-corruption efforts were a source of tension between the Gülenists and the AKP.In political analysis in the months prior to the coup attempt, the incidence of corruption was reported to be ""rife"" in Turkey.Following the coup attempt, some coup leaders cited corruption as a reason for their actions.\n\nOn 13 July, less than two days before the coup was launched, Erdoğan signed a bill giving Turkish soldiers immunity from prosecution while taking part in domestic operations.The bill requires cases against commanders to be approved by the prime minister, while district governors may sign cases against lower-ranking soldiers.The immunity bill was seen as part of the détente between the government and the armed forces.The latter has increasingly been taking over military operations in Kurdish-inhabited areas from police and paramilitary units.\n\nOn 15 July 2016, as reported just before 23:00 EEST (UTC+3), military jets were spotted flying over Ankara, and both the Fatih Sultan Mehmet and Bosphorus bridges in Istanbul were closed.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said military action was being ""taken outside the chain of command"" and it was an ""illegal attempt"" to seize power by ""part of the military"".He further said that those involved ""will pay the highest price.""Local media also reported tanks in Istanbul\'s Atatürk Airport.It was reported that Internet users within Turkey were blocked from accessing Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.Twitter later stated that it had ""no reason to think we\'ve been fully blocked"".Some hostages were taken at military headquarters, including the Turkish Chief of the General Staff Hulusi Akar.At around 21:00, the coupists had invited Salih Zeki Çolak, the commander of the Turkish Land Forces to the military headquarters.When he arrived, he was immediately apprehended.Abidin Ünal, head of the Turkish Air Force, who had been attending a wedding in Istanbul, was abducted from there by soldiers who descended from a helicopter.The coupists then tried to force Akar to sign the coup declaration, almost strangling him using a belt in the process.He refused and was then taken to the Akıncı Air Base and other commanders at the headquarters.The military also entered the Justice and Development Party\'s offices in Istanbul and asked people to leave.\n\nEarly reports said President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was safe in Marmaris, south-west Turkey, where he had been on holiday.\n\nFrom around 23:00 to midnight, helicopters bombed the police special forces headquarters and police air force headquarters in Gölbaşı, just outside of Ankara.The attacks left 42 dead and 43 injured.Türksat headquarters in Gölbaşı was also attacked, killing two security personnel.\n\nAt around 23:50, soldiers occupied Taksim Square in central Istanbul.\n\nAt 00:02, it was reported by Reuters that soldiers were inside the buildings of the state broadcaster, the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), in Ankara.During the coup attempt, soldiers forced anchor Tijen Karaş to read out a statement saying that ""the democratic and secular rule of law has been eroded by the current government"" and that Turkey was now led by the Peace at Home Council who would ""ensure the safety of the population.""The statement read in part: ""Turkish Armed Forces have completely taken over the administration of the country to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedoms, the rule of law and general security that was damaged.[...] All international agreements are still valid.We hope that all of our good relationships with all countries will continue.""The plotters said they had ""done so to preserve democratic order, and that the rule of law must remain a priority"".The statement also ordered temporary martial law (sıkıyönetim), and said a new constitution would be prepared ""as soon as possible"".TRT was then taken off air.\n\nOther media outlets were also raided by the putschists, such as Turkish newspaper Hürriyet and private broadcaster CNN Türk.\n\nReuters reported on 15 July that an EU source described the coup as ""well orchestrated,"" and predicted that ""given the scale of the operation, it is difficult to imagine they will stop short of prevailing.""Another EU diplomat said that the Turkish ambassador in his capital was shocked and ""taking it very seriously"".\n\nThe Peace at Home Council was reportedly chaired by Muharrem Köse.\n\nAdana: Upon receiving the intelligence that thirty soldiers from the 10th Air Base Command would move to the base where the regional and provincial gendarmerie commands were located, the police prevented the soldiers from leaving the guardhouse with TOMA and armored vehicles and blocked them.Bitlis: In the Tatvan district of Bitlis, on the orders of Brigade Commander Arif Seddar Afşar, helicopters were circulated in the skies of Tatvan and fired at the city.The brigade command left the municipality\'s construction equipment in front of the barracks in case there was a tank operation in the district.Denizli: Approximately five hundred officers and non-commissioned officers who participated in the coup attempt surrendered to the gendarmerie and police forces.They were interrogated at Çardak District Gendarme Command.Kars: With the order of Kars 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, the soldiers who came with tanks and armored personnel carriers surrounded the Police Headquarters building and wanted to detain Faruk Karaduman, the chief of police.At the same hours, the invitation of Deputy Governors, 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, went to the command.Kocaeli: Turkcell\'s data center in Gebze was raided by soldiers who participated in the coup attempt.Soldiers who tried to interrupt the internet service were detained.Malatya: A rebellious soldier opened fire inside a base of the Turkish 2nd Army, damaging six vehicles.The base was besieged by police and loyal soldiers, and the shooter was captured.Marmaris: Three military helicopters carried out a bomb attack on the hotel where Erdoğan was staying.Forty rebellious soldiers of the Special Forces Command clashed with the police in the region.Mersin: Mersin Garrison and Mediterranean Region Commander Admiral Nejat Atilla Demirhan called Mersin Provincial Police Deputy Chief Yakup Usta and Gendarmerie Colonel Mustafa Bakçepınar and stated that the Turkish Armed Forces had taken over the administration.He introduced himself as the martial law garrison commander and ordered Mersin Governor Özdemir Çakacak and district governors to be taken into custody.Demirhan and Dağdelen, who made the same announcement with the police radio obtained from Mersin Police Department, were detained through the operation of the security forces.Sakarya: Sakarya Governorship was captured with armored personnel carriers, military trucks and many military jeeps from the military unit in the Kandıra district of Kocaeli.As a reinforcement, two military vehicles full of soldiers from the Sakarya central division command had to return to their barracks in the face of the resistance of the police and the harsh reaction of the people who took to the streets against the putschists.The vehicles occupying the Sakarya Governorate were seized by the citizens and the soldiers in them were neutralized and handed over to the security forces.Afterwards, citizens and security forces entered the governor\'s office and neutralized the soldiers there and suppressed the uprising in the province.Eight civilian citizens were injured as a result of the fire opened by the military during the incident.Şırnak: Çakırsöğüt Gendarmerie Commando Brigadier General Ali Osman Gürcan and 309 soldiers, that participated in the coup attempt, were detained by the security forces.\n\nTurkey\'s Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım responded to the events by stating that an ""illegal action is taking place outside of the chain of command"".He also said that ""the government elected by the people remains in charge and this government will only go when the people say so.""The Turkish Presidential office said President Erdoğan was on holiday inside Turkey and condemned the coup attempt as an attack on democracy.A presidential source also said Erdoğan and his government were still in power.The first messages from Erdoğan were transmitted at around 00:23At about 01:00, Erdoğan did a FaceTime interview with CNN Türk, in which he called upon his supporters to take to the streets in defiance of the military-imposed curfew, saying ""There is no power higher than the power of the people.Let them do what they will at the public squares and airports.""Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş appeared on live television, saying Turkey\'s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is still in charge of the government.The mayor of Ankara, Melih Gökçek of the AKP, encouraged people to go out to the city\'s streets in defiance, despite a curfew imposed by the military.Erdoğan\'s plane took off from Dalaman Airport near Marmaris at 23:47, but had to wait in the air south of Atatürk for the airport to be secured.His plane landed at 02:50\n\nThe First Army General Command in Istanbul stated in a news conference that the TSK did not support the coup and the perpetrators represented a tiny faction that were on the verge of being brought under control.Istanbul Atatürk Airport was closed; all flights from the airport were cancelled.There was an explosion in the TRT broadcasting headquarters and gunfire was reported in Ankara.Soon after, it was stormed by a crowd of civilians and police, with four soldiers inside reportedly being ""neutralized"".The channel went back on air and Karaş, who had previously announced the coup, said live that she had been held hostage and forced to read the declaration of the coup at gunpoint.\n\nBy 01:00, it was reported that the military had pulled its forces from the Atatürk airport and people were coming inside, but by 01:13, it was reported that tanks were inside the airport and gunfire was heard.\n\nTanks opened fire near the Turkish Parliament Building.The parliamentary building was also hit from the air.Injuries were reported among protesters following gunfire on Bosphorus Bridge.\n\nA helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was shot down by a Turkish military F-16 fighter jet.There were also reports of pro-state jets flying over Ankara to ""neutralize"" helicopters used by those behind the coup.\n\nAt 03:08, a military helicopter opened fire on the Turkish parliament.At 03:10, Turkish Armed Forces stated on their website that they had complete control over the country.At 03:12, Yıldırım made a statement saying that the situation was under control and that a no-fly zone was declared over Ankara and that military planes that still flew would be shot down.\n\nIt was reported that the Turkish parliament had been bombed again at 03:23 and 03:33.A helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was also seen flying by it.Half an hour following the report of 12 deaths and 2 injuries in the parliament, soldiers entered CNN Türk\'s headquarters and forced the studio to go off air.After an hour of interruption by the pro-coup soldiers, CNN Türk resumed its broadcast.Later, İsmail Kahraman said a bomb exploded at a corner of the public relations building inside the parliament, with no deaths but several injuries among police officers.\n\nAt around 04:00 two or three helicopters attacked Erdogan\'s hotel.According to eyewitness accounts, ten to fifteen heavily armed men landed and started firing.In the ensuing conflict, two policemen were killed and 8 were injured.\n\nThe Doğan News Agency reported that in Istanbul several individuals were injured after soldiers fired on a group of people attempting to cross the Bosphorus Bridge in protest of the attempted coup.\n\nOn Saturday 16 July 2016, at 00:42 EEST (UTC+3), a Turkish Black Hawk helicopter sent a distress signal and requested permission from Greek authorities for an emergency landing, and landed eight minutes later (00:50) at the Dimokritos airport in Alexandroupoli, in Greece, while two Greek F-16s observed the procedure and escorted it to the airport.The first reports said that the passengers were seven military personnel and a civilian.Later, it turned out that all were military personnel (two majors, four captains and two non-commissioned officers).They had removed the badges and insignia from their uniforms, making it impossible to know their rank.All were arrested after landing for illegal entry into the country.They were transferred to the local police station, while the Greek authorities at the airport guarded the helicopter.The eight passengers all requested political asylum in Greece as they believed they would not get a fair trial in Turkey.On 21 September 2016, Greece denied three out of the eight asylum.The men\'s lawyer Stavroula Tomara said they would be appealing the decision and said they had the ""impression that the decision has been predetermined, and that the interview was conducted just as a formality.""On 11 October 2016, four more of the eight were denied asylum.Two of the men who had previously been denied asylum applied for a re-evaluation but their applications were also rejected.\n\nAfter Erdoğan flew into Istanbul, he made a televised speech inside the airport at around 04:00, whilst thousands gathered outside.He addressed a crowd of supporters in the airport, at about 06:30 He said, ""In Turkey, armed forces are not governing the state or leading the state.They cannot.""He blamed ""those in Pennsylvania"" (a reference to Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, and his Hizmet Movement) for the coup attempt.Erdoğan also said he had plans to ""clean up"" the army, saying that ""This uprising is a gift from God to us.""State-run Anadolu Agency named former Colonel Muharrem Köse, who in March 2016 was dishonorably discharged for reported association with Gülen, as the suspected leader of the coup.However, the Alliance for Shared Values, a non-profit organization associated with Gülen, released a statement reiterating that it condemns any military intervention in domestic politics, and saying Erdoğan\'s allegations against the movement were ""highly irresponsible"".Gülen himself said in a brief statement just before midnight: ""As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nReuters reported that in early hours of 16 July, the coup appeared to have ""crumbled"" as crowds defied pro-coup military orders and gathered in major squares of Istanbul and Ankara to oppose it.Reuters also reported pro-coup soldiers surrendering to the police in Taksim Square, Istanbul.It was reported that by 05:18, Atatürk airport had completely been recaptured by the government whilst the police had surrounded the coupists inside the Turkish army headquarters, calling for them to surrender.Between 06:00–08:00 a skirmish took place there.In Akar\'s absence, Ümit Dündar, head of the First Army, was appointed Acting Chief of Staff.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning of 16 July, soldiers blocking the Bosphorus Bridge surrendered to the police.According to the government-run Anadolu Agency, this consisted of a group of 50 soldiers.Some of these soldiers were lynched by civilians despite the police\'s efforts, who fired into the air to protect the surrendering soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile, in the headquarters of the Turkish Army, 700 unarmed soldiers surrendered as the police conducted an operation into the building while 150 armed soldiers were kept inside by the police.The coupists in the TRT building in Istanbul surrendered in the early morning as well.Chief of Staff Akar, held hostage at the Akıncı Air Base in Ankara, was also rescued by pro-state forces.\n\nOne of the primary reasons that the coup failed was chaos among the plotters\' ranks.Turkey\'s National Intelligence Organization (MİT) head Hakan Fidan discovered the coup plot, and the plotters were forced to execute the coup five hours ahead of schedule.One of the main organizers, General Semih Terzi, was shot dead by loyalist Sgt.Maj.Ömer Halisdemir at the onset, demoralizing and disrupting command and control of the rebels.These two incidents resulted in the coup being carried out in an uncoordinated manner.The highest ranking staff officers opposed the coup, and publicly ordered all personnel to return to their barracks.Acting outside the military chain of command, the rebels lacked the coordination and resources to achieve their goals.The conscripted soldiers that the rebels mobilized were uninformed of their mission\'s true purpose and became demoralized.Many surrendered rather than shoot demonstrators.The commander of the First Army in Istanbul, General Ümit Dündar, personally called Erdoğan to warn him of the plot, persuading him to evacuate his hotel ahead of the plotters, and helped to secure Istanbul for Erdoğan to land.The MİT also mobilized its anti-aircraft guns, which the plotters were unaware existed, deterring rebel jets and commando teams.\n\nEqually important to the coup\'s failure, according to military strategist Edward N. Luttwak, was the inability of the rebels to neutralize Erdoğan and other high ranking government officials, either by killing or detaining them.A unit of special forces was sent via helicopter to kill or capture the president, but missed because he had been evacuated by his security detail just minutes before.Once Erdoğan landed at Atatürk International Airport (which had been recaptured from the rebels by his supporters), It became highly unlikely that the coup attempt would succeed.According to a military source, several rebel F-16s targeted Erdoğan\'s presidential jet en route to Istanbul, but they did not fire.A senior Turkish counter-terrorism official later stated that the jets did not fire because the fighter jet pilots were told by President Erdoğan\'s pilot over the radio that the (flight of the) Gulfstream IV was a Turkish Airlines flight.\n\nAccording to Naunihal Singh, author of Seizing Power, the coup attempt also failed because the plotters failed to secure control of the media and shape the narrative.Successful coups require that the rebels control the mass media.This allows even small rebel contingents to portray themselves as fully in control, and their victory as inevitable.Consequently, they convince the public, along with neutral and even loyalist soldiers, to defect to them or not resist.The rebels failed to properly broadcast their messages effectively across the media that they controlled.They failed to capture Türksat, Turkey\'s main cable and satellite communications company, and failed to gain control of the country\'s television and mobile phone networks.This allowed Erdoğan to make his Facetime call, and to speak on television.\n\nOther scholars of civil-military relations, like Drew H. Kinney, have said reports like Luttwak and Singh\'s miss the point of their own analysis: civil resistance thwarted the coup.Luttwak argues that wayward elements of the Turkish armed forces could not silence Erdoğan.Singh says that the rebels could not project success because they couldn\'t control the message.Kinney states that neither of these reasons on their own matter, but rather it\'s their effect—civil disobedience—that is important.We might find that ""[Gülen\'s movement] ...[might] have had nothing to do with the attempted takeover in July, but civilians [nevertheless] definitely played a role in thwarting the coup,"" writes Kinney.""...[A]n unhappy civilian populace mobilized to face down the military.""\n\nErdoğan wasn\'t censored (Luttwak\'s point) and was therefore able to use FaceTime to mobilize resistance, which in turn hindered the conspirators\' ability to project success (Singh\'s point).The result is civilian resistance to soldiers, i.e., people power.The reason Singh, Luttwak, and other scholars of civil-military relations miss this is, according to Kinney, because they ""usually do not study extra-military reasons for coup failures/successes,"" but rather put a premium on ""the inner-workings of the [military] operation.""In short, they blame the military for its failure rather than acknowledge the power of the masses and their successes.\n\nPro-state forces sent text messages to every Turkish citizen calling for them to protest against the coup attempt.Throughout the night sela prayers were repeatedly called from mosque minarets across the country to encourage people to resist the coup plotters.While the sela is usually called from minarets to inform the public of a funeral, they are also traditionally performed to notify of a significant event, in this case ""to rally people"".\n\nThe coup plotters initiated their operation hours ahead of the planned time when they understood that their plans had been compromised.Had the coup been launched at its original time, the middle of the night, much of the population would have been asleep.The streets would have been mostly empty.\n\nReports have emerged, neither confirmed nor denied by Russia or Turkey that the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate intercepted signals on an imminent coup passed on to loyal Turkish operatives.The intercepted plans revealed several helicopters with commandos were on the way to Marmaris\'s coastal resort, where Erdoğan stayed, capturing or killing him.Pre-warned, Erdoğan left quickly to avoid them.\n\nAn extensive purge of the Turkish civil service began in the wake of the coup attempt, with President Erdoğan warning his opponents that ""they will pay a heavy price for this.""The New York Times along with some other Western media such as The Economist, described the purges as a ""counter-coup"", with the Times expecting the president to ""become more vengeful and obsessed with control than ever, exploiting the crisis not just to punish mutinous soldiers but to further quash whatever dissent is left in Turkey,"".As of 20 July 2016, the purge already had seen over 45,000 military officials, police officers, judges, governors and civil servants arrested or suspended, including 2,700 judges, 15,000 teachers, and every university dean in the country.\n\n163 generals and admirals were detained, around 45% of the Turkish military\'s total.\n\nOn 18 July 2016, United States State Secretary John Kerry urged Turkish authorities to halt the increasing crackdown on its citizens, indicating that the crackdown was meant to ""suppress dissent.""French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault voiced concern, warning against a ""political system which turns away from democracy"" in response to the purges.\n\nOn 17 August 2016, Turkey started releasing what was expected to eventually amount to about 38,000 prison inmates, to make more space in the penal system for detainees, numbering about 35,000, who were arrested or detained after being involved in or suspected of association, with the 2016 failed coup.\n\nOn 28 September 2016, Turkish justice minister Bekir Bozdağ said 70,000 people had been processed and 32,000 were formally arrested.\n\nMajor General Cahit Bakir, who commanded Turkish forces under NATO in Afghanistan, and Brigadier General Sener Topuc, responsible for education and aid in Afghanistan, were detained by authorities in Dubai connected with the failed coup.\n\nGeneral Akın Öztürk, former Commander of the Turkish Air Force, was the Turkish military attaché to Israel.He was arrested on charges of having played a leading role in the failed coup.Öztürk has denied the charges.\n\nGeneral Adem Huduti, the commander of the Second Army, positioned along the southern borders with Syria and Iraq, and General Erdal Öztürk, the commander of the 3rd Corps, were also arrested.\n\nRear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been stationed at NATO\'s Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk, Virginia, sought asylum in the United States after being recalled by the Turkish government.\n\nIn July 2018, Istanbul\'s 25th Criminal Court sentenced 72 former soldiers involved in the coup attempt to life in prison.\n\nOn 20 June 2019, a terrorism court in Turkey sentenced 151 people to life in prison, including General Akın Öztürk, former commander of Turkish Air Force and the most senior officer involved in the coup.128 people received ""aggravated life"" sentences, which indicates harsh conditions without parole, for their role in the coup, with another 23 receiving standard life sentences.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom President Erdoğan said as one of the principal conspirators, condemned the coup attempt and denied any role in it.""I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey,"" he said in an emailed statement reported by The New York Times.""Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force.I pray to God for Turkey, Turkish citizens, and all those currently in Turkey that this situation is resolved peacefully and quickly.As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nPresident Erdoğan asked the United States to extradite Gülen: ""I call on you again, after there was a coup attempt.Extradite this man in Pennsylvania to Turkey!If we are strategic partners or model partners, do what is necessary.""Prime Minister Yildirim has threatened war against any country that would support Gülen.Turkish Labor Minister Süleyman Soylu said that ""America is behind the coup.""\n\nRegarding the AKP\'s statement against Gülen, Secretary of State Kerry invited the Turkish government ""to present us with any legitimate evidence that withstands scrutiny,"" before they would accept an extradition request.\n\nOn 15 August 2016, former United States diplomat James Jeffrey, who was the United States ambassador to Turkey from 2008 until 2010 made the following remarks: ""The Gülen movement has some infiltration at the least in the military that I am aware of.They of course had extreme infiltration into the police and judiciary earlier.I saw that when I was in Turkey previously, particularly in the Sledgehammer case, Hakan Fidan case, and the corruption cases in 2013.Obviously, significant segment of Turkey\'s bureaucracy was infiltrated and had their allegiance to a movement.That of course is absolutely unacceptable and extremely dangerous.It likely led to the coup attempt.""\n\nOutside Turkey, in Beringen, Belgium, anti-coup protesters attempted to attack a building owned by the pro-Gülen movement group \'Vuslat\'.The police brought in a water cannon to keep the attackers at bay.In news articles it was stated that the police also protected the houses of Gülen supporters.People advocated on social media to go to Beringen once more, and there was unrest in Heusden-Zolder, elsewhere in Belgium.Furthermore, in Somalia the government ordered ""the total closure of all activities"" of an organization linked to the Gülen movement, and gave its staff seven days to leave the country.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, President Erdoğan said Western countries were ""supporting terrorism"" and the military coup, saying ""I\'m calling on the United States: what kind of strategic partners are we, that you can still host someone whose extradition I have asked for?""\n\nOn 31 January 2017, British Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, Alan Duncan said he believed the Gülen movement was responsible for the coup attempt.Duncan went on saying ""the organization which incorporated itself into the state tried to topple the democratic structure in Turkey"".\n\nIn a speech on 29 July 2016, President Erdoğan said U.S. Central Command chief Joseph Votel was ""siding with coup plotters""; Erdoğan said the United States was protecting Fethullah Gülen, whom the Turkish government blames for the coup attempt.Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim made similar comments.In response, Votel said that the Turkish government\'s statements were ""unfortunate and completely inaccurate"" and expressed concern that the mass arrests and firings of military officers would damage military cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey.Similarly, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said that the Turkish military purges were impairing the fight against ISIS.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, in an escalation of tensions with the United States, Erdoğan questioned Turkey\'s relationship with the United States and criticized the West, saying that ""script"" for the abortive putsch last month was ""written abroad"".Erdoğan stated that he had personally asked Obama to extradite Gülen to Turkey.When the U.S. government replied it would need evidence of the cleric\'s guilt before extradition, to which Erdoğan said: ""When you asked for the return of a terrorist, we did not ask for documentation. ...Let us put him on trial.""\n\nYeni Şafak daily, a Turkish pro-state newspaper, stated that the former commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, now-retired United States Army General John F. Campbell, was the ""mastermind"" behind the coup attempt in Turkey.Campbell called the statement ""absolutely ridiculous"" and President Obama said ""Any reports that we had any previous knowledge of a coup attempt, that there was any U.S. involvement in it, that we were anything other than entirely supportive of Turkish democracy are completely false, unequivocally false.""\n\nOn 1 December 2017, Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for American political analyst, former CIA official and former vice chairman of US National Intelligence Council Graham Fuller, stating his involvement in the coup.A career US State Department official who was once CIA Station Chief in Kabul and later went on to be a political scientist in Rand Corporation specializing in the Middle East, Turkish authorities said Fuller attended a meeting in Istanbul on 15 July 2016 involving organization and coordination of the botched coup.Another American among the attendance, as stated by the Turkish prosecutors, was academic Henri Barkey who was named a suspect a week after the failed coup.\n\nThe U.S. consulate in Turkey issued an advisory to U.S. citizens to avoid the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey, which houses about 50 nuclear bombs, until ""normal operations have been restored"".They stated that local authorities were denying access to the air base and that power supplying the air base was shut off.\n\nThe Incirlik base is important to the U.S.-led effort in Syria to combat ISIL and other militants.Nearly 1,500 American personnel are housed in the base.\n\nTwenty-four hours after initial reports that the air base was shut down, United States defense department officials confirmed that the base and its airspace had re-opened to military aircraft and that operations by American aircraft will resume.The Turkish commander of the air base, brig.Gen. Bekir Ercan Van was arrested.After the failure of the coup Gen Bekir Ercan Van sought asylum from the U.S., but his request was denied by U.S.\n\nFollowing the failed coup attempt multiple media outlets have published editorials advocating the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Incirlik Air base as Turkey is unstable.\n\nOn 16 July, anti-coup protesters chanted against locals in areas of Istanbul with high concentration of Alevis, including Okmeydanı and Gazi.Such incidents also occurred in a quarter of Antakya with a high Alevi population, where a motorcyclist stating to be a sharia advocate was lynched.In a neighbourhood of Ankara, shops belonging to Syrians were attacked by a mob.In Malatya, Sunni Islamists harassed residents of an Alevi neighbourhood, particularly the women, and attempted to enter the neighbourhood en masse.Police intervened and blocked all roads leading there.In Kadıköy, people drinking alcohol in public were attacked by a group of religious fundamentalists.\n\nFollowing the arrests, thousands of anti-coup protesters demanded instituting the death penalty against detainees connected with the coup, chanting ""we want the death penalty"".President Erdoğan has been open to reinstituting the death penalty, noting that ""in a democracy, whatever the people want they will get.""Turkish authorities have not executed anyone since 1984, but legally abolished capital punishment only in 2004 as a pre-condition to join the European Union.\n\nEuropean Union officials have been vocal about their opposition to purges by Turkish authorities in connection to the coup.French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that Turkey must work within the framework of the law to uphold Europe\'s democratic principles.Furthermore, on 18 July 2016, Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of Foreign Affairs of the European Union, announced that no country will be admitted into the European Union ""if it introduces the death penalty"".Moreover, German press secretary, Steffen Seibert, stated that reinstituting the death penalty will end Turkey\'s accession talks with the European Union.\n\nTurkey is a member of the Council of Europe, and ratified the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) as part of its terms of membership.The ECHR is an international treaty that includes the abolition of the death penalty among its terms.As such, Turkey is legally bound not to reintroduce the death penalty.\n\nOn 20 July 2016, President Erdoğan announced a three-month state of emergency in response to the attempted coup, invoking Article 120 of the Constitution of Turkey (""Declaration of state of emergency because of widespread acts of violence and serious deterioration of public order"").Under the state of emergency, under Article 121, ""the Council of Ministers, meeting under the chairpersonship of the President of the Republic, may issue decrees having the force of law on matters necessitated by the state of emergency"", with decrees subject to subsequent parliamentary approval.The state of emergency was endorsed by the Parliament on 21 July by 346 votes to 115.The Justice and Development Party and the Nationalist Movement Party supported the state of emergency, whilst the Republican People\'s Party and the Peoples\' Democratic Party opposed it.Prime Minister Yıldırım said at the Parliament that the state of emergency was necessary to ""get rid of this scourge rapidly"".\n\nAs part of the state of emergency, deputy prime minister Kurtulmuş announced that Turkey was temporarily suspending part of the European Convention on Human Rights following the attempted coup, invoking Article 15 of the Convention (""war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation"").The suspensions must be notified to the Council of Europe and may not affect the right to a fair trial or the prohibition on torture.\n\nThis state of emergency in Turkey as well as the hindrance of the right to protest that occurred within such framework have been layered onto a longer history of emergency rules, oppressive legislation and daily government practice that have reinforced both.We can see from this the ""autocratisation"" process in Turkey has thrived of existing legal framework deeply associated in legacies of past ""emergencies"".\n\nOn 3 October 2016 Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş declared the governments intention to extend the state of emergency by a further three months raising objections from both the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) and Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) were critical of the governments use of their emergency powers and declared that they would vote against an extension.\n\nFollowing the National Security Council\'s recommendation for the extension President Erdoğan stated that it was possible that the state of emergency could last for longer than a year prompting outcry from the opposition, Leader of the Main Opposition Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu said that ""The president saying that the state of emergency can last longer than 12 months is strengthening the fear of a counter-coup"" and that it was ""raising the prospect of opportunist measures.""\n\nThe AKP\'s governmental majority allowed the three-month extension to take effect on 19 October 2016.The two-year-long state of emergency was ended on 19 July 2018.\n\nOn 16 July 2016, the media reported that eight Turkish military personnel of various ranks had landed in Greece\'s northeastern city of Alexandroupolis on board a Black Hawk helicopter and claimed political asylum in Greece.While the Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu demanded extradition of ""the eight traitors as soon as possible"", the Greek authorities stated: ""We will follow the procedures of international law.However, we give severe considerations to the fact that [the Turkish military men] are accused, in their own country, of violating the constitutional order and trying to overthrow democracy.""The helicopter was returned to Turkey shortly thereafter.The eight asylum seekers, their asylum case pending, were later transferred to Athens, mainly for safety reasons.On 26 January, the Supreme Court of Greece eventually ruled against their extradition, on the grounds that the eight were unlikely to face a fair trial if returned to their home country and due to concerns over their safety.\n\nOn 15 February 2017, five Turkish commandos illegally entered Greece through the Evros river.However, once they entered the country, the group split.The two of them surrendered to the police and on 20 February 2017, requested political asylum.They were being held in the city of Alexandroupolis.The two men belonged to the Turkish navy.The names given by the two reportedly match the names of two fugitives wanted in relation to the shadowy operation against Erdoğan himself.The Greek government mentioned that the Greek authorities will not allow the country to be dragged into the ongoing feud between the Turkish state and the followers of Gulen.But there were no sign of the other three.According to a lawyer there were indications that the other three have been arrested by Greek authorities who were about to expel them to Turkey.According to new evidence and new information these three ""arrested"" marines were delivered under fast and informal procedures from Greek to Turkish services.\n\nAfter the coup attempt, two Turkish military attachés in Athens, Staff Col. İlhan Yaşıtlı and naval attaché Col. Halis Tunç, had reportedly disappeared along with their families.The Greek foreign ministry canceled the two attachés\' accreditations on 7 August 2016, upon the request of the Turkish foreign ministry.Greek media reported that they might have fled to Italy.On 11 August 2016, the Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu confirmed the reports saying that they had left Greece for Italy on 6 August and adding that Turkey would officially ask the Italian authorities to extradite the two soldiers.\n\nOn 9 August 2016, the media reported that Turkey\'s Rear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been on a United States-based assignment for NATO and after the coup was subject to a detention order in Turkey, had sought asylum in the United States.\n\nIn mid-November 2016, it was officially confirmed that about 40 Turkish military servicemen of various ranks stationed at NATO command structures had applied for asylum in Germany and Belgium.\n\nIn January 2017, Der Spiegel magazine and ARD broadcaster reported that about 40 mostly high-ranking Turkish soldiers who worked at NATO facilities in Germany requested asylum in Germany.\n\nAt the end of February 2017, Germany said it had received 136 asylum requests from Turks holding diplomatic passports since the July coup attempt.The figure was a total for August 2016 to January 2017; some were presumed to be military officers posted to NATO bases in Germany.\n\nIn November 2016, NATO\'s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that Turkish NATO Officers had requested asylum in the countries where they had been posted.He did not name the nations involved or the number of officers, saying it was a matter for those countries to decide.He said: ""Some Turkish officers working in NATO command structure ... have requested asylum in the countries where they are working. ...As always, this is an issue that is going to be assessed and decided by the different NATO allies as a national issue.""\n\nAs of March 2017, Norway have granted asylum for four Turkish soldiers and a military attache.\n\nSeveral Turkish citizens with diplomatic passports have sought political asylum in Switzerland.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, detainees in Turkey have been denied access to legal counsel, have been beaten and tortured.They have not been provided with adequate food, water, or medical care.At least one has attempted suicide.Amnesty International wanted the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture to send people to check on detainees conditions.A person who had been on duty at the Ankara police headquarters said that police denied medical treatment to a detainee.""Let him die.We will say he came to us dead,"" the witness quoted a police doctor as saying.\n\nAlso, Erdoğan has extended the maximum period of detention for suspects from four days to 30, a move Amnesty said increased the risk of torture or other maltreatment of detainees.\n\nTurkish Justice Ministry denied the reports and the Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said on his Twitter account: ""There has not been any torture or assault of detainees in custody,"" in response to reports by Amnesty International.""The claims of torture and assault make up a pre-packaged misinformation campaign formed by members of FETÖ, one which is untrue and distorted,""\n\nOn 7 August, between three and five million people gathered for an anti-coup rally organized by the Turkish authorities in Istanbul.President Erdoğan and the two leaders of the major opposition parties (the Republican People\'s Party and the Nationalist Movement Party) were present.\n\nGreek authorities on several Aegean islands have called for emergency measures to curtail a growing flow of refugees from Turkey; the number of migrants and refugees willing to make the journey across the Aegean has increased noticeably after the failed coup.At Athens officials voiced worries because Turkish monitors overseeing the deal in Greece had been abruptly pulled out after the failed coup without being replaced.Also, the mayor of Kos expressed concern in a letter to the Greek Prime Minister citing the growing influx of refugees and migrants after the failed coup.The Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises (SETE) warned about the prospect of another flare-up in the refugee/migrant crisis due to the Turkish political instability.\n\nVincent Cochetel, the director of the Europe Bureau of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in August 2016 that parts of the EU-Turkey deal about immigration were already de facto suspended because no Turkish police were present at Greek detention centres to oversee deportations.\n\nOn 25 August 2016, seven Turkish citizens sought asylum in Greece.Two were university professors, and their two children applied for asylum in Alexandroupoli after they illegally entered the country from the northeastern border.Also, three businessmen illegally reached the Greek island of Rhodes, and they also applied for asylum.\n\nOn 30 August 2016, a Turkish judge arrived at the Greek island of Chios on a migrant boat, with six Syrian nationals, and sought asylum in the country.He told the Greek coastguard and police officers that he is being persecuted in Turkey for his political beliefs by President Tayyip Erdoğan.The Turkish judge had been arrested for illegally entering the country and was transferred to Athens for his asylum proceedings.The Syrian nationals claimed refugee status.\n\nOn 11 September 2016, four Turkish civilians were arrested by Turkish police.An academic and a teacher attempted to escape to Greece illegally by crossing the Evros river, and the other two because they organized the escape attempt.The academic and the teacher paid a total of 12,500 euros in Istanbul to arrange their escape to Greece.Before their attempt, both the academic and the teacher were suspended from their duties as part of the ongoing probe into the failed coup attempt.Police also seized an air raft, an oar and a pump while detaining the suspects.The court later ordered the two\'s release while the other two suspects, who organized the escape attempt, were arrested.\n\nOn 21 September 2016, ten Turkish civilians, two men, two women and six children landed by boat illegally on the Greek island of Rhodes and sought asylum.They told the Greek authorities they were working in the private sector in Turkey and the Turkish government was persecuting them due to their political beliefs.\n\nOn 29 September 2016, five Turkish nationals, a couple and their child and two other men, arrived in Greece, at Alexandroupolis by crossing the Evros River by boat illegally and requested political asylum.\n\nOn 12 December 2016, one female Turkish national, landed by boat, full of refugees and immigrants, illegally on the Greek island of Lesbos.She requested political asylum.\n\nOn 24 October 2017, Turkish authorities obtained information that 995 Turks have applied for asylum in Greece after the coup attempt.\n\nMore than 1,800 Turkish citizens requested asylum in Greece in 2017.\n\nOn 18 February 2018, seventeen Turkish nationals, including six children, requested asylum in Greece at Oinousses island.\n\nIn August 2018, the former lawmaker for the Peoples\' Democratic Party, Leyla Birlik, requested asylum in Greece after illegally crossing the border near Alexandroupolis.\n\nBerlin mayor, Michael Müller (SPD), said Turkey was waging war on supporters of the Gülen movement in Germany.He said that Turkish officials had approached him and asked him whether he would be prepared to confront the Gülen movement in Berlin critically and, if necessary, to support measures against it.The mayor rejected the idea and made it very clear that Turkish conflicts could not be waged in the city.\n\nDer Spiegel presented classified documents, which showed that Turkey\'s secret service (MIT) had asked Germany\'s foreign intelligence agency (BND) for help in rounding up Gülen supporters in Germany.The Turkish secret service wanted the BND to use its influence to spur German lawmakers into taking action against Gülen supporters and extraditing them to Turkey.Also, Turkey\'s government has sent German authorities requests for searches and extraditions linked to supporters of Fethullah Gülen in Germany.\n\nIn Germany businesses thought to be in support of the Gülen movement have been harassed by Erdoğan supporters.\n\nAfter the failed coup, there was a massive demonstration in Cologne at Germany, in late July, in support of Turkish President Erdoğan.Erdoğan wanted to address the participants via video but was rejected by the local authorities and the German Constitutional Court due to security concerns.Turkey said that the ban was unacceptable and a violation of freedom of expression.\n\nGerman authorities said Turkish mosques in Germany were playing Turkish politics and worried that Turkey\'s internal politics spilled over into German cities.For years, German authorities had encouraged Turkey\'s state-run religious institution Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs usually referred to as DİTİB to provide Islamic preachers and teachers and Gülen Movement Schools for the large Turkish diaspora in Germany.DİTİB manages some 900 mosques in Germany.Gülen movement runs 100 educational facilities in Germany.\n\nAfter the failed coup DİTİB published a sermon praising ""our noble nation"" for rising against ""a wretched network"" that had sown ""seeds of sedition, rebellion and hostility.""According to Volker Beck, a member of the center-left Greens in Germany\'s Bundestag, ""That was not a religious text.It was a declaration of obedience to Mr. Erdoğan and his measures since the coup attempt,"" Volker Kauder, parliamentary group leader of the Germany\'s ruling Christian Democrats, the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU)/Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) faction, said Turkish-Germans should be loyal to Germany first and foremost.\n\nGermans of Turkish origin are being pressured in Germany by informers and officers of Turkey\'s MIT spy agency.According to reports Turkey had 6,000 informants plus MIT officers in Germany who were putting pressure on ""German Turks"".Hans-Christian Ströbele said that there was an ""unbelievable"" level of ""secret activities"" in Germany by Turkey\'s MIT agency.According to Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, not even the former communist East German Stasi secret police had managed to run such a large ""army of agents"" in the former West Germany: ""Here, it\'s not just about intelligence gathering, but increasingly about intelligence service repression.""\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nGermany\'s Office for Migration and Refugees said on 18 November 2016, it had received 4,437 political asylum requests from Turkish citizens up to October, compared to 1,767 for the whole of last year.""We must expect that the number of Turks who are seeking political asylum in Germany will continue to rise,"" said Stephan Mayer, the domestic policy speaker of the union coalition in the Bundestag.\n\nOn 10 December 2016, eleven Turkish nationals, 10 adults and one child, in a martial arts group have applied for asylum in Germany.\n\nAs of January 2018, Germany was first place and Greece second as EU destinations of choice for Turkish nationals requesting asylum after the coup attempt.\n\nTurkish police have carried out simultaneous raids in 18 cities against companies associated with United States-based Fethullah Gülen.The state-run Anadolu Agency said police searched 204 premises and detained 187 businessmen for ""membership in a terror organization"" and ""providing financial support to a terror organization"".All suspects\' assets were seized.\n\nWikiLeaks released Turkish emails and documents to respond to the Turkish government\'s purges that followed the coup attempt.In turn, the Turkish Telecommunications Communications Board blocked access to the WikiLeaks website.On 17 July 2016 Wikileaks had announced on Twitter, the leak of approximately 300,000 emails and over 500,000 documents, including those to and from AKP.\n\nWikiLeaks stated that it was attacked shortly after 17 July announcement of the planned publication and hypothesized that Turkish authorities were responsible.WikiLeaks stated in a tweet, ""our infrastructure is under sustained attack.""Tweets from WikiLeaks include ""We are unsure of the true origin of the attack.The timing suggests a Turkish state power faction or its allies.We will prevail & publish.""and: ""Turks will likely be censored to prevent them reading our pending release of 100k+ docs on politics leading up to the coup."", ""We ask that Turks are ready with censorship bypassing systems such as TorBrowser and uTorrent""; ""And that everyone else is ready to help them bypass censorship and push our links through the censorship to come.""\n\nUpon the release of the email dump, it has been reported that the emails contain little to no damning information, and instead are just mails from a public mailing list, but also linked externally to ""voter information on all of the women registered to vote in 78 out of Turkey\'s 81 provinces"".\n\nSeveral places were renamed to commemorate the failed coup: Boğaziçi Köprüsü (Bosphorus Bridge) → 15 Temmuz Şehitler Köprüsü Kızılay Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Kızılay Demokrasi Meydanı Ahmet Taner Kışlalı Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Milli İrade Meydanı (Reverted to original name a few days later) Büyük İstanbul Otogarı → İstanbul 15 Temmuz Demokrasi Otogarı In TRT, Yeni Haber Stüdyosu → 15 Temmuz Millet Stüdyosu Kazan → Kahramankazan about the province\'s local people\'s resistance to the coup plotters.Kahraman means ""hero"" in Turkish Niğde University → Niğde Ömer Halisdemir University\n\nIn 2018, the Istanbul Municipal Council decided to change the names of a total of 90 streets that included words which could be associated with FETÖ.\n\nThe Presidency of Religious Affairs stated that it would not be providing religious funeral services to the dead coupists, except for ""privates and low-ranking officers compelled by force and threats who found themselves in the midst of the conflict without full knowledge of anything"".\n\nA document dated 26 September 2016 showed that Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) asked Turkish missions and religious representatives abroad to profile Gülen movement expatriates living in their respective foreign countries.Gülen-linked schools, businesses, foundations, associations, media outlets and others were also included in the reports.Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs has gathered intelligence via imams from 38 countries.\n\nBelgium officials said they would withdraw recognition of Diyanet mosques in the country if necessary.\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nOn 21 December 2016, the Turkish government has recalled Yusuf Acar, the religious affairs attaché of the Turkish Embassy in the Netherlands, after Dutch authorities said he was spying.Acar collected information of people who sympathize with Fethullah Gülen at Netherlands and passed it on to the Turkish authorities.The Dutch government called spying activities an ""unwanted and non-acceptable interference in the lives of Dutch citizens.""and the attaché was reportedly declared persona non grata and received a ""deportation warning"" by Dutch authorities.\n\nOn 26 January 2017, President Erdoğan, during his visit to Tanzania, asked his Tanzanian counterpart John Magufuli to take action against the network of Fethullah Gülen.\n\nIn April 2017 it was announced that President Erdoğan planned to establish a purpose-built museum dedicated to the coup events, called the ""Museum of the 15 July: Martyrs and Democracy"", to be located in Kahramankazan, a town near Ankara.Paid for by Turkish Ministry of Culture funds, it is planned to open at the end of 2018.The museum opened in December 2019\n\nAmong the Turkish opposition parties, the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) issued a statement expressing their public opposition to the coup, and the Hürriyet Daily News reported that Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bahçeli telephoned Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım to express his opposition to the coup.The co-chairs of the opposition Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) issued a statement saying that the party was ""under all circumstances and as a matter of principle against all kinds of coup.""Amongst the minor parties, left-wing nationalist Patriotic Party\'s Doğu Perinçek backed democracy, when he held Gülen and the Americans responsible.Kurdish militant separatist organization Kurdistan Workers\' Party, which Turkey and its allies label as a terrorist organization, urged their supporters to stay away from the coup and rather defend their people, while the Communist Party called upon the people to overthrow the AKP government which they called an ""enemy of humanity"".\n\nDuring the first hours of the coup plotters\' moves of blocking Istanbul\'s bridges and flying fighter jets low over Istanbul and Ankara, Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjørn Jagland tweeted against the coup attempt and underlined that ""any attempt to overthrow the democratically elected leaders is unacceptable"".\n\nRussia\'s President Vladimir Putin called Erdoğan out of solidarity before all NATO member countries\' heads following the coup attempt.Erdoğan thanked the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev – who was the first president to show solidarity after the coup attempt – for his support in solving the 7-month crisis over downed Russian Sukhoi Su-24 and the Prime Minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, who was among the first NATO country leaders to condemn the coup attempt, already from the early hours of Saturday.\n\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the then prime minister of Pakistan, was all praise for the people of Turkey and the AKP government and strongly condemned what he termed as an attempt to undermine democracy in Turkey.""We deeply admire the resolve of the brave and resilient Turkish people, who stood up against the forces of darkness and anarchy to express their support and commitment to democracy,"" the PM said in a statement issued from his office.\n\nThe majority of countries either expressed their support for the government or called for restraint.On 16 July 2016, however, a proposed United Nations Security Council statement denouncing the coup was not accepted by Egypt, a non-permanent member of the Council at the time, due to textual disagreements.Egyptian diplomats said that the council is ""in no position to qualify, or label [the Turkish] government – or any other government for that matter – as democratically elected or not"".Objection by the United States and the UK – permanent members of the Security Council – led to Egypt proposing a new statement calling for all sides to ""respect the democratic and constitutional principles and the rule of law"", which was rejected, preventing the condemnation of the coup attempt by the Security Council.The leader of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky supported the coup attempt.\n\nAl-Monitor reported that ""Unlike Ankara\'s Western allies, Iran did not wait for the coup\'s failure to speak up.Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif voiced support for democracy in a Twitter message in the early hours of the unrest, writing ""Stability, and democracy in Turkey are paramount"".In a subsequent phone call after the failure of the coup attempt, President Hassan Rouhani told Erdoğan the coup attempt was ""a test to identify your domestic and foreign friends and enemies.""An Iranian official pointed out parallels between the coup attempt in Turkey and the coup against Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mussadiq in 1953: ""What we know is that this attempt was triggered by foreign hands.We have experienced the same thing in the past.Since Mr. Erdogan wants to play a more positive path in the region today, they want to overthrow him.""\n\nMustafa Akıncı, President of Northern Cyprus, welcomed the fact that ""no community in Turkey ... applauded the coup as they have done in the past.""Azerbaijan strongly condemned the attempted military coup in Turkey and considered such actions unacceptable according to a statement from Novruz Mammadov, deputy head of the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration and chief of the foreign relations department.\n\nEuropean Commissioner dealing with Turkey\'s EU membership bid, Johannes Hahn, said it appears Turkey\'s government prepared arrest lists of political opponents before the coup attempt and had been waiting for the right time to act.In this sense, EU reported that as a main criticism to put this issue in the category of terrorism become the violation of the fundamental rights and fundamental values of the citizens.Hence, it underlines a total divergence of opinions and mentality between EU and Turkey which reached a deadlock here especially after the 15th of July in 2016.\n\nOn 19 July 2016, White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said during a press briefing that President Barack Obama has held a phone conversation with President Erdoğan: ""The President used the phone call to reiterate once again the strong commitment of the United States to the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey.The President pledged any needed assistance to the Turkish government as they conduct an investigation to determine exactly what happened.""\n\nOn 20 July 2016, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""Turkey has a large armed force, professional armed forces and ...I am certain they will continue as a committed and strong NATO ally.""On a statement released on 10 August 2016, the Secretary General once more strongly condemned the attempted coup and reiterated full support for Turkey\'s democratic institutions.He also expressed support for the elected Turkish government and respect for the courage of the Turkish people for resisting the coup plotters.\n\nOn 29 July 2016, the commander of U.S. Central Command, General Joseph Votel, denied statements by Turkey\'s president Erdoğan that he has supported the coup attempt in Turkey.\n\nOn 1 August 2016, United States Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, General Joseph Dunford, visited Turkey and condemned the coup attempt.Dunford said: ""The consistent theme throughout the day was a reaffirmation of the importance of the U.S.-Turkey relationship – the need for us to cooperate.""\n\nOn July, 20, there were reports that a group of Turkish military commandos coup fugitives would try to cross from Turkey to the island of Symi, in the southeastern Aegean, at Greece.The Hellenic Coast Guard was on alert and increased the patrols in the area, especially after a group of inflatable dinghies and other vessels were seen departing from Datça, on the Turkish coast, in the direction of Symi, they monitored the movements of the Turkish vessels, which remained in Turkish waters.Furthermore, a contingent of the Hellenic Police was dispatched to Symi to conduct checks there.The Greek government had been anticipating a possible attempt by participants in the failed coup to come to Greece and took the reports seriously.Turkish F-16 fighter jets were also scrambled to check reports that missing Turkish coast guard vessels had appeared in Greek waters in the Aegean.Later on the day, the Turkish interior ministry denied reports that rebel soldiers might have ""hijacked"" a vessel to flee to Greece.The Greek armed forces remained on alert the throughout the day for potential coup fugitives.\n\nAccording to Michael Rubin, from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Erdoğan had himself to blame for the coup.Following an increasingly Islamist agenda, Erdoğan had reportedly ""dropped any pretense of governing for all Turks.""After ""fanning the flames"" at the 2013 Gezi Park protests, he transformed the predominantly Kurdish-inhabited areas of southeastern Turkey ""into a war zone reminiscent of the worst days of the 1980s.""The biggest problem, according to Rubin, might have been Erdoğan\'s foreign policy, which managed to turn the initial ""no problems with neighbors"" doctrine into a situation where the country has problems with almost every neighbor and has even alienated some of its allies and friends.Rubin previously worked as an official at the Pentagon and less than 4 months before the coup, he wrote an article in Newsweek magazine titled, ""Will There Be a Coup Against Erdogan in Turkey?""\n\nBritish Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk warned that ""too late did Erdoğan realize the cost of the role he had chosen for his country.It\'s one thing to say sorry to Putin and patch up relations with Netanyahu; but when you can no longer trust your army, there are more serious matters to concentrate upon.""Even if this coup may have failed, Fisk expected another to follow in the months or years to come.\n\nTurkish professor Akın Ünver described the coup d\'état attempt as ""more of a mutiny"".\n\nThe name of the ""Peace at Home Council"" – Yurtta Sulh Konseyi – is derived from Atatürk\'s famous saying \'Peace at Home, Peace in the World\'.Journalist Ezgi Başaran said that ""the statement of the junta, that was [...] read on the [...] government TV [channel] as the coup got under way, bore a strong resemblance to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk\'s famous address to the Turkish Youth.[...] On the other hand, given that these references are too obvious, they may have been intentionally included to insinuate a Kemalist junta rather than a Gülenist one.""\n\nThe citizen journalism site Bellingcat published an analysis of the messages of a WhatsApp group consisting of high-ranking military officials who had taken part in the coup covering their activities including them killing several people.The messages were cross referenced with video footage.The group was named ""Yurtta sulh"" which refers to a peace at home speech and they seem secular and military with no references to Gülen or anything related during the several hours of messaging.\n\nNews reports have suggested that the coup ringleader was Adil Öksüz.Some believe Öksüz to have been an operative with Turkish intelligence.\n\nGerman Islamic studies scholar said the putschists tried to forestall a large-scale purge of judiciary and military, the implementation of which had already started on Saturday, the day after the coup attempt.According to Turkish investigative journalist Ahmet Şık, a list of officials to be purged had been ready compiled by the attorney-general of Izmir, Okan Bato, and was approved by President Erdoğan.According to this version, the putschists had to quickly bring forward their coup attempt before being disposed and arrested.\n\nDuring and after the events, several politicians and commentators suggested that the government knew about the coup in advance and possibly directed it.The facts that the coup attempt began in the evening rather than at a more inconspicuous time and that the events were largely confined to Ankara and Istanbul contributed to doubts about the authenticity of the coup attempt.Journalists and opposition politicians branded it a \'tragic comedy\' and \'theatre play\'.Advocates of such theories pointed to how Erdoğan stood to gain from the coup attempt in terms of increasing his popularity and support for his calls for an executive presidency, while being able to legitimize further crackdowns on judicial independence and the opposition in general.\n\nOther elements that were reported to support the theory included: no list of demands by the coup plotters, the organization and response of the police, the long lists of arrests that seemed to be ready surprisingly quickly (including arrests of 2,745 judges and 2,839 soldiers), and the obvious nature of the coup actions.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom Erdoğan had said as being one of the principal conspirators, commented, ""I don\'t believe that the world believes the accusations made by President Erdoğan.There is a possibility that it could be a staged coup and it could be meant for further accusations [against the Gülenists].""Journalist Cengiz Çandar, a veteran observer of Turkey\'s coups, said ""I have never seen any with this magnitude of such inexplicable sloppiness.""Prominent Hizmet (Gülen movement) spokesman Alp Aslandogan said, referencing that the Turkish Air Force commander met with Erdoğan before 15 July, that certain legal documentation related to the coup seemed written beforehand, arguing that within ""the indictment written by a prosecutor on the night of 15 July to 16 July, there were events there that didn\'t actually happen.Some events did happen, but those events didn\'t happen by the time the document started.It looks like a bigger plan was there, and part of the plan did not come to pass.""\n\nThe organization and spontaneous synchronization by large numbers of mosques was perceived to be unachievable unless there had been prior preparation, with journalists also pointing to how Erdoğan could have strategically used the call to prayer to invoke religious sentiment in a political situation as a veiled attack on state secularism.\n\nThousands of arrests and purges were conducted by Turkish authorities between 16 and 18 July 2016.The sheer number of these arrests made at such a speed could only be done so if the ""Turkish government had all those lists ready"", as suggested by Johannes Hahn, European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, on 18 July 2016.Hahn also said that because these lists were already available immediately after the coup, the ""event was prepared"" and the lists were to be used ""at a certain stage"".\n\nMehmet Dişli, who was seen giving orders to the coup plotters and who was the one who put a belt around Hulusi Akar\'s neck to make him sign, is the brother of Şaban Dişli, a former vice president of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and confidant of Erdoğan.\n\nSeveral social media users have compared the coup attempt to the Reichstag fire in 1933, which Adolf Hitler used as an excuse to suspend civil liberties and order mass arrests of his opponents.Politico correspondent Ryan Heath said that ""the coup was staged to allow Erdoğan to purge the military of opponents and increase his grip on the country"".Heath used Twitter to share comments from his Turkish source, who called the events of Friday night a ""fake coup"" which would help a ""fake democracy warrior"" (referring to Erdoğan).The source said: ""Probably we\'ll see an early election [in] which he\'ll try to guarantee an unbelievable majority of the votes.And this will probably guarantee another 10–15 years of authoritarian, elected dictatorship.""\n\nThe New York Times reported that some Turkish citizens believed the coup attempt was staged by Erdoğan to improve his public image and popularity, while cracking down on political opponents and expanding his power.Critics found it suspect that reportedly no government officials were arrested or harmed during the attempted coup, which—among other factors—raised the suspicion of a false flag event staged by the Turkish government to crack down on opposition parties.Those in Turkey suggesting that the coup was staged are also being questioned by the government.\n\nPoliticians and journalists who were skeptical of the authenticity of the coup plot said that in reality, a \'civil coup\' had effectively been staged against the Armed Forces and Judiciary, both of which were extensively purged of stated Gülen supporters by the government shortly after the events.Skeptics said that the coup would be used as an excuse for further erosion of judicial independence and a crackdown on the opposition, giving the AKP greater and unstoppable power over all state institutions and paving the way for a more radical Islamist agenda at odds with the founding principles of the Turkish Republic.\n\nJustice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said in late July 2016 that Turkish social media users who said the government was staging the coup faced investigation: ""Just look at the people who are saying on social media that this was theatre.Public prosecutors are already investigating them.Most of them are losers who think it is an honor to die for Fethullah Gülen\'s command.""\n\nOn 12 July 2017, Stockholm Center for Freedom, a monitoring group with reported links to the Gülen movement, published a controversial report stating that President Erdogan orchestrated the coup bid as a false flag to consolidate his powers, set up his opposition for a mass persecution, and push Turkish Armed Forces into a military incursion into Syria.According to the report, it uncovered new evidence from 11 July 2016, four days before the planned coup bid, that a secret plan was circulated among select group of Armed Forces to give an appearance of a coup attempt.The plan was sanctioned by intelligence and military chiefs with the approval of Erdogan.\n\nIn early November 2017, Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for , former Director of the Middle East Program of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, stating that he is an agent of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), that he was present in Istanbul during the 2016 Turkish coup attempt, and that he was one of the key organizers behind the coup attempt.Around 1 December, the Istanbul prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for Graham E. Fuller, an American author and political analyst specializing in Islamic extremism after a long CIA career and holding the role of vice-chair of the United States National Intelligence Council.The prosecutor\'s office based the warrant on suspicion of Fuller helping to plan the coup attempt.Hürriyet stated that Turkish authorities believed that they had traced Fuller\'s location before the attempted coup and afterward when he left Turkey.\n\nBarkey denied his reported role in the coup, describing the claims as ""so ludicrous that they do not even deserve the term \'science fiction\'.""\n\nDeep state in Turkey The Imam\'s Army List of coups and coup attempts since 2010 List of modern conflicts in the Middle East List of attacks on legislatures\n', 'Claim_Context': 'In March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.

104,"{'Wiki_Title': '2016 Turkish coup attempt', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'On 15 July 2016, a faction within the Turkish Armed Forces, organized as the Peace at Home Council, attempted a coup d\'état against state institutions, including the government and president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.They attempted to seize control of several places in Ankara, Istanbul, Marmaris and elsewhere, such as the Asian side entrance of the Bosphorus Bridge, but failed to do so after forces and civilians loyal to the state defeated them.The Council cited an erosion of secularism, elimination of democratic rule, disregard for human rights, and Turkey\'s loss of credibility in the international arena as reasons for the coup.The government said it had evidence the coup leaders were linked to the Gülen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the Republic of Turkey and led by Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish businessman and a well-known Islamic scholar who lives in exile in Pennsylvania.The Turkish government alleged that Gülen was behind the coup (which Gülen denied) and that the United States was harboring him.Events surrounding the coup attempt and the purges in its aftermath reflect a complex power struggle between Islamist elites in Turkey.\n\nDuring the coup attempt, over 300 people were killed and more than 2,100 were injured.Many government buildings, including the Turkish Parliament and the Presidential Palace, were bombed from the air.Mass arrests followed, with at least 40,000 detained, including at least 10,000 soldiers and 2,745 judges, for being affiliated with the coup attempt.15,000 education staff were also suspended and the licenses of 21,000 teachers working at private institutions were revoked after the government stated they were loyal to Gülen.More than 77,000 people have been arrested and over 160,000 fired from their jobs, on reports of connections to Gülen.\n\nThere were many reactions against the coup attempt, both domestically and internationally.The main opposition parties in Turkey condemned the attempt, while several international leaders—such as those of the United States, NATO, the European Union, and neighboring countries—called for ""respect of the democratic institutions in Turkey and its elected officials.""Many international organizations also opposed the coup.The United Nations Security Council, however, did not denounce the coup after disagreements over the phrasing of a statement.Iran opposed the coup and advised Erdogan to defeat the coup plotters.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the head of United States Central Command, General Joseph Votel, was ""siding with coup plotters"", after Votel criticized the Turkish government for arresting the Pentagon\'s contacts in Turkey.\n\nIn March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.The same month, the British Parliament\'s Foreign Affairs Select Committee said some Gulenists were involved in the coup d\'état attempt but found no hard evidence that Fethullah Gülen masterminded the failed coup and found no evidence to justify the United Kingdom designating the Gülen movement as a ""terrorist organization"".\n\nSince the 1970s, followers of the influential cleric Fethullah Gülen had assumed increasingly important positions within the Turkish state apparatus.Gülen several times advised his followers to take key positions in society and government, if necessary with a secret identity to avoid opposition from the laicistic Turkish army and government.Nevertheless, at the start of the 21st century, Gülen\'s followers achieved crucial positions of power in Turkey (and beyond) with a vast network of newspapers, TV channels, schools, associations, lobby organizations, financial institutions and positions within the state such as the army and the judiciary.Initially, the then Prime Minister Erdogan seemingly tolerated the power of the Gülen movement because of common interests such as limiting the undemocratic political power of the military, but also because of impotence and fear of Gülen\'s power within Turkey.\n\nA series of events eventually led to a rift between Erdogan and Gülen.For example, prosecutors that allegedly were aligned with the Gülen movement tried to arrest the intelligence chief Hakan Fidan for the peace negotiations with the PKK, and by extension PM Erdogan subsequently, as the Turkish secret service is directly subordinate to the prime minister of Turkey.During this period (2010-2013), state secrets were leaked, fraud was committed with the entrance exams for government employees (KPSS), a change of power occurred at the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) and (sex)tapes of both government members and opposition members were leaked.Following these events and other incidents, the Turkish government decided to designate the Gülen movement as parallel state and FETÖ (Fethullahist Terror Organization).Alleged Gülen supporters were fired or arrested.The coup attempt that followed is therefore also described by some analysts as a last desperate attempt by Gülenists to retain power.\n\nIt is widely reported that Kemalist ideology played a huge role in motivating the 15 July 2016 coup attempt, like all previous political interventions in the history of Turkey\'s military coups.Since the establishment of multiparty democracy in Turkey in 1946, the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), together with the judiciary, have viewed themselves as guardians of Kemalist ideals and the secular Turkish nationalist state established under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk against political parties that have promoted a larger role for Islam and minorities in public life.The military and judiciary have regularly intervened in politics to block or ban popular parties representing conservative Muslim Turks, attempting to relax the restrictions on traditional religious practices, such as women\'s wearing of headscarves.The military has toppled four elected governments: by coups in 1960 and 1980, and by military decisions in 1971 and 1997.The military has also banned several major political parties.In 1998, Erdoğan, then-mayor of Istanbul, was banned for life from politics and jailed because he had read a religious poem by Ziya Gökalp several years before, at a public meeting.In 2007, the military expressed its opposition to the election of Abdullah Gül, of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), as president, by issuing an e-memorandum.Still, Gül was eventually elected when the AKP won both a referendum on the matter.Also, a snap election, and the party returned with a larger majority in the parliament.The military cited erosion of secularism as one of the reasons for the coup in the statement published on the day of the coup.\n\nAs opposed to previous political interventions by the Turkish military, Turkey\'s AKP government and pro-state media maintain that the 15 July 2016 coup attempt was not motivated by allegiance to Kemalist ideology, but rather to the vast political, economic, and religious network led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen.Between 2007 and 2012, high-profile Kemalists, including high-ranking officers of the Turkish Armed Forces, faced a series of trials and purges, under reports of involvement in a secret society codenamed ""Ergenekon.""Supported by Islamist (both pro-Gülen and pro-Erdoğan) prosecutors, security officials, and media, the purges allowed lower-rank Islamist officers to assume high-ranking military positions.They were seen as a bid by Turkey\'s civilian leaders under President Erdoğan to establish dominance over the military.In these trials in 2013 – viewed as ""sensational"" and ""one of the biggest in recent Turkish history"" – 275 people, including senior military officers, journalists, lawyers, and academics, were said to be involved in the so-called ""Ergenekon"" conspiracy, reportedly plotting a coup in 2003/04 against then–Prime Minister Erdoğan.Additionally, some military officers were said to be involved in a separate reported plot, Sledgehammer.Simultaneously, Erdoğan promoted lower-ranking officers up the chain of command, ensuring that the military chief of staff was loyal to him and thereby demoralizing the army.\n\nThe AKP\'s alliance with Gülen started to collapse during 2013 as Gülenists targeted the AKP using corruption charges.After the split, Erdoğan decided it would be advantageous to rehabilitate the army.The ""Ergenekon"" convictions were overturned in April 2016 by the Court of Cassation, which ruled that the existence of the network was unproven.\n\nIn 2013, law enforcement efforts to fight corruption, which had led to the 2013 corruption scandal in Turkey, were faulted by Erdoğan.The anti-corruption efforts were a source of tension between the Gülenists and the AKP.In political analysis in the months prior to the coup attempt, the incidence of corruption was reported to be ""rife"" in Turkey.Following the coup attempt, some coup leaders cited corruption as a reason for their actions.\n\nOn 13 July, less than two days before the coup was launched, Erdoğan signed a bill giving Turkish soldiers immunity from prosecution while taking part in domestic operations.The bill requires cases against commanders to be approved by the prime minister, while district governors may sign cases against lower-ranking soldiers.The immunity bill was seen as part of the détente between the government and the armed forces.The latter has increasingly been taking over military operations in Kurdish-inhabited areas from police and paramilitary units.\n\nOn 15 July 2016, as reported just before 23:00 EEST (UTC+3), military jets were spotted flying over Ankara, and both the Fatih Sultan Mehmet and Bosphorus bridges in Istanbul were closed.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said military action was being ""taken outside the chain of command"" and it was an ""illegal attempt"" to seize power by ""part of the military"".He further said that those involved ""will pay the highest price.""Local media also reported tanks in Istanbul\'s Atatürk Airport.It was reported that Internet users within Turkey were blocked from accessing Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.Twitter later stated that it had ""no reason to think we\'ve been fully blocked"".Some hostages were taken at military headquarters, including the Turkish Chief of the General Staff Hulusi Akar.At around 21:00, the coupists had invited Salih Zeki Çolak, the commander of the Turkish Land Forces to the military headquarters.When he arrived, he was immediately apprehended.Abidin Ünal, head of the Turkish Air Force, who had been attending a wedding in Istanbul, was abducted from there by soldiers who descended from a helicopter.The coupists then tried to force Akar to sign the coup declaration, almost strangling him using a belt in the process.He refused and was then taken to the Akıncı Air Base and other commanders at the headquarters.The military also entered the Justice and Development Party\'s offices in Istanbul and asked people to leave.\n\nEarly reports said President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was safe in Marmaris, south-west Turkey, where he had been on holiday.\n\nFrom around 23:00 to midnight, helicopters bombed the police special forces headquarters and police air force headquarters in Gölbaşı, just outside of Ankara.The attacks left 42 dead and 43 injured.Türksat headquarters in Gölbaşı was also attacked, killing two security personnel.\n\nAt around 23:50, soldiers occupied Taksim Square in central Istanbul.\n\nAt 00:02, it was reported by Reuters that soldiers were inside the buildings of the state broadcaster, the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), in Ankara.During the coup attempt, soldiers forced anchor Tijen Karaş to read out a statement saying that ""the democratic and secular rule of law has been eroded by the current government"" and that Turkey was now led by the Peace at Home Council who would ""ensure the safety of the population.""The statement read in part: ""Turkish Armed Forces have completely taken over the administration of the country to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedoms, the rule of law and general security that was damaged.[...] All international agreements are still valid.We hope that all of our good relationships with all countries will continue.""The plotters said they had ""done so to preserve democratic order, and that the rule of law must remain a priority"".The statement also ordered temporary martial law (sıkıyönetim), and said a new constitution would be prepared ""as soon as possible"".TRT was then taken off air.\n\nOther media outlets were also raided by the putschists, such as Turkish newspaper Hürriyet and private broadcaster CNN Türk.\n\nReuters reported on 15 July that an EU source described the coup as ""well orchestrated,"" and predicted that ""given the scale of the operation, it is difficult to imagine they will stop short of prevailing.""Another EU diplomat said that the Turkish ambassador in his capital was shocked and ""taking it very seriously"".\n\nThe Peace at Home Council was reportedly chaired by Muharrem Köse.\n\nAdana: Upon receiving the intelligence that thirty soldiers from the 10th Air Base Command would move to the base where the regional and provincial gendarmerie commands were located, the police prevented the soldiers from leaving the guardhouse with TOMA and armored vehicles and blocked them.Bitlis: In the Tatvan district of Bitlis, on the orders of Brigade Commander Arif Seddar Afşar, helicopters were circulated in the skies of Tatvan and fired at the city.The brigade command left the municipality\'s construction equipment in front of the barracks in case there was a tank operation in the district.Denizli: Approximately five hundred officers and non-commissioned officers who participated in the coup attempt surrendered to the gendarmerie and police forces.They were interrogated at Çardak District Gendarme Command.Kars: With the order of Kars 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, the soldiers who came with tanks and armored personnel carriers surrounded the Police Headquarters building and wanted to detain Faruk Karaduman, the chief of police.At the same hours, the invitation of Deputy Governors, 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, went to the command.Kocaeli: Turkcell\'s data center in Gebze was raided by soldiers who participated in the coup attempt.Soldiers who tried to interrupt the internet service were detained.Malatya: A rebellious soldier opened fire inside a base of the Turkish 2nd Army, damaging six vehicles.The base was besieged by police and loyal soldiers, and the shooter was captured.Marmaris: Three military helicopters carried out a bomb attack on the hotel where Erdoğan was staying.Forty rebellious soldiers of the Special Forces Command clashed with the police in the region.Mersin: Mersin Garrison and Mediterranean Region Commander Admiral Nejat Atilla Demirhan called Mersin Provincial Police Deputy Chief Yakup Usta and Gendarmerie Colonel Mustafa Bakçepınar and stated that the Turkish Armed Forces had taken over the administration.He introduced himself as the martial law garrison commander and ordered Mersin Governor Özdemir Çakacak and district governors to be taken into custody.Demirhan and Dağdelen, who made the same announcement with the police radio obtained from Mersin Police Department, were detained through the operation of the security forces.Sakarya: Sakarya Governorship was captured with armored personnel carriers, military trucks and many military jeeps from the military unit in the Kandıra district of Kocaeli.As a reinforcement, two military vehicles full of soldiers from the Sakarya central division command had to return to their barracks in the face of the resistance of the police and the harsh reaction of the people who took to the streets against the putschists.The vehicles occupying the Sakarya Governorate were seized by the citizens and the soldiers in them were neutralized and handed over to the security forces.Afterwards, citizens and security forces entered the governor\'s office and neutralized the soldiers there and suppressed the uprising in the province.Eight civilian citizens were injured as a result of the fire opened by the military during the incident.Şırnak: Çakırsöğüt Gendarmerie Commando Brigadier General Ali Osman Gürcan and 309 soldiers, that participated in the coup attempt, were detained by the security forces.\n\nTurkey\'s Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım responded to the events by stating that an ""illegal action is taking place outside of the chain of command"".He also said that ""the government elected by the people remains in charge and this government will only go when the people say so.""The Turkish Presidential office said President Erdoğan was on holiday inside Turkey and condemned the coup attempt as an attack on democracy.A presidential source also said Erdoğan and his government were still in power.The first messages from Erdoğan were transmitted at around 00:23At about 01:00, Erdoğan did a FaceTime interview with CNN Türk, in which he called upon his supporters to take to the streets in defiance of the military-imposed curfew, saying ""There is no power higher than the power of the people.Let them do what they will at the public squares and airports.""Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş appeared on live television, saying Turkey\'s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is still in charge of the government.The mayor of Ankara, Melih Gökçek of the AKP, encouraged people to go out to the city\'s streets in defiance, despite a curfew imposed by the military.Erdoğan\'s plane took off from Dalaman Airport near Marmaris at 23:47, but had to wait in the air south of Atatürk for the airport to be secured.His plane landed at 02:50\n\nThe First Army General Command in Istanbul stated in a news conference that the TSK did not support the coup and the perpetrators represented a tiny faction that were on the verge of being brought under control.Istanbul Atatürk Airport was closed; all flights from the airport were cancelled.There was an explosion in the TRT broadcasting headquarters and gunfire was reported in Ankara.Soon after, it was stormed by a crowd of civilians and police, with four soldiers inside reportedly being ""neutralized"".The channel went back on air and Karaş, who had previously announced the coup, said live that she had been held hostage and forced to read the declaration of the coup at gunpoint.\n\nBy 01:00, it was reported that the military had pulled its forces from the Atatürk airport and people were coming inside, but by 01:13, it was reported that tanks were inside the airport and gunfire was heard.\n\nTanks opened fire near the Turkish Parliament Building.The parliamentary building was also hit from the air.Injuries were reported among protesters following gunfire on Bosphorus Bridge.\n\nA helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was shot down by a Turkish military F-16 fighter jet.There were also reports of pro-state jets flying over Ankara to ""neutralize"" helicopters used by those behind the coup.\n\nAt 03:08, a military helicopter opened fire on the Turkish parliament.At 03:10, Turkish Armed Forces stated on their website that they had complete control over the country.At 03:12, Yıldırım made a statement saying that the situation was under control and that a no-fly zone was declared over Ankara and that military planes that still flew would be shot down.\n\nIt was reported that the Turkish parliament had been bombed again at 03:23 and 03:33.A helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was also seen flying by it.Half an hour following the report of 12 deaths and 2 injuries in the parliament, soldiers entered CNN Türk\'s headquarters and forced the studio to go off air.After an hour of interruption by the pro-coup soldiers, CNN Türk resumed its broadcast.Later, İsmail Kahraman said a bomb exploded at a corner of the public relations building inside the parliament, with no deaths but several injuries among police officers.\n\nAt around 04:00 two or three helicopters attacked Erdogan\'s hotel.According to eyewitness accounts, ten to fifteen heavily armed men landed and started firing.In the ensuing conflict, two policemen were killed and 8 were injured.\n\nThe Doğan News Agency reported that in Istanbul several individuals were injured after soldiers fired on a group of people attempting to cross the Bosphorus Bridge in protest of the attempted coup.\n\nOn Saturday 16 July 2016, at 00:42 EEST (UTC+3), a Turkish Black Hawk helicopter sent a distress signal and requested permission from Greek authorities for an emergency landing, and landed eight minutes later (00:50) at the Dimokritos airport in Alexandroupoli, in Greece, while two Greek F-16s observed the procedure and escorted it to the airport.The first reports said that the passengers were seven military personnel and a civilian.Later, it turned out that all were military personnel (two majors, four captains and two non-commissioned officers).They had removed the badges and insignia from their uniforms, making it impossible to know their rank.All were arrested after landing for illegal entry into the country.They were transferred to the local police station, while the Greek authorities at the airport guarded the helicopter.The eight passengers all requested political asylum in Greece as they believed they would not get a fair trial in Turkey.On 21 September 2016, Greece denied three out of the eight asylum.The men\'s lawyer Stavroula Tomara said they would be appealing the decision and said they had the ""impression that the decision has been predetermined, and that the interview was conducted just as a formality.""On 11 October 2016, four more of the eight were denied asylum.Two of the men who had previously been denied asylum applied for a re-evaluation but their applications were also rejected.\n\nAfter Erdoğan flew into Istanbul, he made a televised speech inside the airport at around 04:00, whilst thousands gathered outside.He addressed a crowd of supporters in the airport, at about 06:30 He said, ""In Turkey, armed forces are not governing the state or leading the state.They cannot.""He blamed ""those in Pennsylvania"" (a reference to Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, and his Hizmet Movement) for the coup attempt.Erdoğan also said he had plans to ""clean up"" the army, saying that ""This uprising is a gift from God to us.""State-run Anadolu Agency named former Colonel Muharrem Köse, who in March 2016 was dishonorably discharged for reported association with Gülen, as the suspected leader of the coup.However, the Alliance for Shared Values, a non-profit organization associated with Gülen, released a statement reiterating that it condemns any military intervention in domestic politics, and saying Erdoğan\'s allegations against the movement were ""highly irresponsible"".Gülen himself said in a brief statement just before midnight: ""As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nReuters reported that in early hours of 16 July, the coup appeared to have ""crumbled"" as crowds defied pro-coup military orders and gathered in major squares of Istanbul and Ankara to oppose it.Reuters also reported pro-coup soldiers surrendering to the police in Taksim Square, Istanbul.It was reported that by 05:18, Atatürk airport had completely been recaptured by the government whilst the police had surrounded the coupists inside the Turkish army headquarters, calling for them to surrender.Between 06:00–08:00 a skirmish took place there.In Akar\'s absence, Ümit Dündar, head of the First Army, was appointed Acting Chief of Staff.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning of 16 July, soldiers blocking the Bosphorus Bridge surrendered to the police.According to the government-run Anadolu Agency, this consisted of a group of 50 soldiers.Some of these soldiers were lynched by civilians despite the police\'s efforts, who fired into the air to protect the surrendering soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile, in the headquarters of the Turkish Army, 700 unarmed soldiers surrendered as the police conducted an operation into the building while 150 armed soldiers were kept inside by the police.The coupists in the TRT building in Istanbul surrendered in the early morning as well.Chief of Staff Akar, held hostage at the Akıncı Air Base in Ankara, was also rescued by pro-state forces.\n\nOne of the primary reasons that the coup failed was chaos among the plotters\' ranks.Turkey\'s National Intelligence Organization (MİT) head Hakan Fidan discovered the coup plot, and the plotters were forced to execute the coup five hours ahead of schedule.One of the main organizers, General Semih Terzi, was shot dead by loyalist Sgt.Maj.Ömer Halisdemir at the onset, demoralizing and disrupting command and control of the rebels.These two incidents resulted in the coup being carried out in an uncoordinated manner.The highest ranking staff officers opposed the coup, and publicly ordered all personnel to return to their barracks.Acting outside the military chain of command, the rebels lacked the coordination and resources to achieve their goals.The conscripted soldiers that the rebels mobilized were uninformed of their mission\'s true purpose and became demoralized.Many surrendered rather than shoot demonstrators.The commander of the First Army in Istanbul, General Ümit Dündar, personally called Erdoğan to warn him of the plot, persuading him to evacuate his hotel ahead of the plotters, and helped to secure Istanbul for Erdoğan to land.The MİT also mobilized its anti-aircraft guns, which the plotters were unaware existed, deterring rebel jets and commando teams.\n\nEqually important to the coup\'s failure, according to military strategist Edward N. Luttwak, was the inability of the rebels to neutralize Erdoğan and other high ranking government officials, either by killing or detaining them.A unit of special forces was sent via helicopter to kill or capture the president, but missed because he had been evacuated by his security detail just minutes before.Once Erdoğan landed at Atatürk International Airport (which had been recaptured from the rebels by his supporters), It became highly unlikely that the coup attempt would succeed.According to a military source, several rebel F-16s targeted Erdoğan\'s presidential jet en route to Istanbul, but they did not fire.A senior Turkish counter-terrorism official later stated that the jets did not fire because the fighter jet pilots were told by President Erdoğan\'s pilot over the radio that the (flight of the) Gulfstream IV was a Turkish Airlines flight.\n\nAccording to Naunihal Singh, author of Seizing Power, the coup attempt also failed because the plotters failed to secure control of the media and shape the narrative.Successful coups require that the rebels control the mass media.This allows even small rebel contingents to portray themselves as fully in control, and their victory as inevitable.Consequently, they convince the public, along with neutral and even loyalist soldiers, to defect to them or not resist.The rebels failed to properly broadcast their messages effectively across the media that they controlled.They failed to capture Türksat, Turkey\'s main cable and satellite communications company, and failed to gain control of the country\'s television and mobile phone networks.This allowed Erdoğan to make his Facetime call, and to speak on television.\n\nOther scholars of civil-military relations, like Drew H. Kinney, have said reports like Luttwak and Singh\'s miss the point of their own analysis: civil resistance thwarted the coup.Luttwak argues that wayward elements of the Turkish armed forces could not silence Erdoğan.Singh says that the rebels could not project success because they couldn\'t control the message.Kinney states that neither of these reasons on their own matter, but rather it\'s their effect—civil disobedience—that is important.We might find that ""[Gülen\'s movement] ...[might] have had nothing to do with the attempted takeover in July, but civilians [nevertheless] definitely played a role in thwarting the coup,"" writes Kinney.""...[A]n unhappy civilian populace mobilized to face down the military.""\n\nErdoğan wasn\'t censored (Luttwak\'s point) and was therefore able to use FaceTime to mobilize resistance, which in turn hindered the conspirators\' ability to project success (Singh\'s point).The result is civilian resistance to soldiers, i.e., people power.The reason Singh, Luttwak, and other scholars of civil-military relations miss this is, according to Kinney, because they ""usually do not study extra-military reasons for coup failures/successes,"" but rather put a premium on ""the inner-workings of the [military] operation.""In short, they blame the military for its failure rather than acknowledge the power of the masses and their successes.\n\nPro-state forces sent text messages to every Turkish citizen calling for them to protest against the coup attempt.Throughout the night sela prayers were repeatedly called from mosque minarets across the country to encourage people to resist the coup plotters.While the sela is usually called from minarets to inform the public of a funeral, they are also traditionally performed to notify of a significant event, in this case ""to rally people"".\n\nThe coup plotters initiated their operation hours ahead of the planned time when they understood that their plans had been compromised.Had the coup been launched at its original time, the middle of the night, much of the population would have been asleep.The streets would have been mostly empty.\n\nReports have emerged, neither confirmed nor denied by Russia or Turkey that the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate intercepted signals on an imminent coup passed on to loyal Turkish operatives.The intercepted plans revealed several helicopters with commandos were on the way to Marmaris\'s coastal resort, where Erdoğan stayed, capturing or killing him.Pre-warned, Erdoğan left quickly to avoid them.\n\nAn extensive purge of the Turkish civil service began in the wake of the coup attempt, with President Erdoğan warning his opponents that ""they will pay a heavy price for this.""The New York Times along with some other Western media such as The Economist, described the purges as a ""counter-coup"", with the Times expecting the president to ""become more vengeful and obsessed with control than ever, exploiting the crisis not just to punish mutinous soldiers but to further quash whatever dissent is left in Turkey,"".As of 20 July 2016, the purge already had seen over 45,000 military officials, police officers, judges, governors and civil servants arrested or suspended, including 2,700 judges, 15,000 teachers, and every university dean in the country.\n\n163 generals and admirals were detained, around 45% of the Turkish military\'s total.\n\nOn 18 July 2016, United States State Secretary John Kerry urged Turkish authorities to halt the increasing crackdown on its citizens, indicating that the crackdown was meant to ""suppress dissent.""French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault voiced concern, warning against a ""political system which turns away from democracy"" in response to the purges.\n\nOn 17 August 2016, Turkey started releasing what was expected to eventually amount to about 38,000 prison inmates, to make more space in the penal system for detainees, numbering about 35,000, who were arrested or detained after being involved in or suspected of association, with the 2016 failed coup.\n\nOn 28 September 2016, Turkish justice minister Bekir Bozdağ said 70,000 people had been processed and 32,000 were formally arrested.\n\nMajor General Cahit Bakir, who commanded Turkish forces under NATO in Afghanistan, and Brigadier General Sener Topuc, responsible for education and aid in Afghanistan, were detained by authorities in Dubai connected with the failed coup.\n\nGeneral Akın Öztürk, former Commander of the Turkish Air Force, was the Turkish military attaché to Israel.He was arrested on charges of having played a leading role in the failed coup.Öztürk has denied the charges.\n\nGeneral Adem Huduti, the commander of the Second Army, positioned along the southern borders with Syria and Iraq, and General Erdal Öztürk, the commander of the 3rd Corps, were also arrested.\n\nRear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been stationed at NATO\'s Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk, Virginia, sought asylum in the United States after being recalled by the Turkish government.\n\nIn July 2018, Istanbul\'s 25th Criminal Court sentenced 72 former soldiers involved in the coup attempt to life in prison.\n\nOn 20 June 2019, a terrorism court in Turkey sentenced 151 people to life in prison, including General Akın Öztürk, former commander of Turkish Air Force and the most senior officer involved in the coup.128 people received ""aggravated life"" sentences, which indicates harsh conditions without parole, for their role in the coup, with another 23 receiving standard life sentences.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom President Erdoğan said as one of the principal conspirators, condemned the coup attempt and denied any role in it.""I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey,"" he said in an emailed statement reported by The New York Times.""Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force.I pray to God for Turkey, Turkish citizens, and all those currently in Turkey that this situation is resolved peacefully and quickly.As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nPresident Erdoğan asked the United States to extradite Gülen: ""I call on you again, after there was a coup attempt.Extradite this man in Pennsylvania to Turkey!If we are strategic partners or model partners, do what is necessary.""Prime Minister Yildirim has threatened war against any country that would support Gülen.Turkish Labor Minister Süleyman Soylu said that ""America is behind the coup.""\n\nRegarding the AKP\'s statement against Gülen, Secretary of State Kerry invited the Turkish government ""to present us with any legitimate evidence that withstands scrutiny,"" before they would accept an extradition request.\n\nOn 15 August 2016, former United States diplomat James Jeffrey, who was the United States ambassador to Turkey from 2008 until 2010 made the following remarks: ""The Gülen movement has some infiltration at the least in the military that I am aware of.They of course had extreme infiltration into the police and judiciary earlier.I saw that when I was in Turkey previously, particularly in the Sledgehammer case, Hakan Fidan case, and the corruption cases in 2013.Obviously, significant segment of Turkey\'s bureaucracy was infiltrated and had their allegiance to a movement.That of course is absolutely unacceptable and extremely dangerous.It likely led to the coup attempt.""\n\nOutside Turkey, in Beringen, Belgium, anti-coup protesters attempted to attack a building owned by the pro-Gülen movement group \'Vuslat\'.The police brought in a water cannon to keep the attackers at bay.In news articles it was stated that the police also protected the houses of Gülen supporters.People advocated on social media to go to Beringen once more, and there was unrest in Heusden-Zolder, elsewhere in Belgium.Furthermore, in Somalia the government ordered ""the total closure of all activities"" of an organization linked to the Gülen movement, and gave its staff seven days to leave the country.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, President Erdoğan said Western countries were ""supporting terrorism"" and the military coup, saying ""I\'m calling on the United States: what kind of strategic partners are we, that you can still host someone whose extradition I have asked for?""\n\nOn 31 January 2017, British Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, Alan Duncan said he believed the Gülen movement was responsible for the coup attempt.Duncan went on saying ""the organization which incorporated itself into the state tried to topple the democratic structure in Turkey"".\n\nIn a speech on 29 July 2016, President Erdoğan said U.S. Central Command chief Joseph Votel was ""siding with coup plotters""; Erdoğan said the United States was protecting Fethullah Gülen, whom the Turkish government blames for the coup attempt.Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim made similar comments.In response, Votel said that the Turkish government\'s statements were ""unfortunate and completely inaccurate"" and expressed concern that the mass arrests and firings of military officers would damage military cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey.Similarly, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said that the Turkish military purges were impairing the fight against ISIS.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, in an escalation of tensions with the United States, Erdoğan questioned Turkey\'s relationship with the United States and criticized the West, saying that ""script"" for the abortive putsch last month was ""written abroad"".Erdoğan stated that he had personally asked Obama to extradite Gülen to Turkey.When the U.S. government replied it would need evidence of the cleric\'s guilt before extradition, to which Erdoğan said: ""When you asked for the return of a terrorist, we did not ask for documentation. ...Let us put him on trial.""\n\nYeni Şafak daily, a Turkish pro-state newspaper, stated that the former commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, now-retired United States Army General John F. Campbell, was the ""mastermind"" behind the coup attempt in Turkey.Campbell called the statement ""absolutely ridiculous"" and President Obama said ""Any reports that we had any previous knowledge of a coup attempt, that there was any U.S. involvement in it, that we were anything other than entirely supportive of Turkish democracy are completely false, unequivocally false.""\n\nOn 1 December 2017, Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for American political analyst, former CIA official and former vice chairman of US National Intelligence Council Graham Fuller, stating his involvement in the coup.A career US State Department official who was once CIA Station Chief in Kabul and later went on to be a political scientist in Rand Corporation specializing in the Middle East, Turkish authorities said Fuller attended a meeting in Istanbul on 15 July 2016 involving organization and coordination of the botched coup.Another American among the attendance, as stated by the Turkish prosecutors, was academic Henri Barkey who was named a suspect a week after the failed coup.\n\nThe U.S. consulate in Turkey issued an advisory to U.S. citizens to avoid the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey, which houses about 50 nuclear bombs, until ""normal operations have been restored"".They stated that local authorities were denying access to the air base and that power supplying the air base was shut off.\n\nThe Incirlik base is important to the U.S.-led effort in Syria to combat ISIL and other militants.Nearly 1,500 American personnel are housed in the base.\n\nTwenty-four hours after initial reports that the air base was shut down, United States defense department officials confirmed that the base and its airspace had re-opened to military aircraft and that operations by American aircraft will resume.The Turkish commander of the air base, brig.Gen. Bekir Ercan Van was arrested.After the failure of the coup Gen Bekir Ercan Van sought asylum from the U.S., but his request was denied by U.S.\n\nFollowing the failed coup attempt multiple media outlets have published editorials advocating the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Incirlik Air base as Turkey is unstable.\n\nOn 16 July, anti-coup protesters chanted against locals in areas of Istanbul with high concentration of Alevis, including Okmeydanı and Gazi.Such incidents also occurred in a quarter of Antakya with a high Alevi population, where a motorcyclist stating to be a sharia advocate was lynched.In a neighbourhood of Ankara, shops belonging to Syrians were attacked by a mob.In Malatya, Sunni Islamists harassed residents of an Alevi neighbourhood, particularly the women, and attempted to enter the neighbourhood en masse.Police intervened and blocked all roads leading there.In Kadıköy, people drinking alcohol in public were attacked by a group of religious fundamentalists.\n\nFollowing the arrests, thousands of anti-coup protesters demanded instituting the death penalty against detainees connected with the coup, chanting ""we want the death penalty"".President Erdoğan has been open to reinstituting the death penalty, noting that ""in a democracy, whatever the people want they will get.""Turkish authorities have not executed anyone since 1984, but legally abolished capital punishment only in 2004 as a pre-condition to join the European Union.\n\nEuropean Union officials have been vocal about their opposition to purges by Turkish authorities in connection to the coup.French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that Turkey must work within the framework of the law to uphold Europe\'s democratic principles.Furthermore, on 18 July 2016, Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of Foreign Affairs of the European Union, announced that no country will be admitted into the European Union ""if it introduces the death penalty"".Moreover, German press secretary, Steffen Seibert, stated that reinstituting the death penalty will end Turkey\'s accession talks with the European Union.\n\nTurkey is a member of the Council of Europe, and ratified the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) as part of its terms of membership.The ECHR is an international treaty that includes the abolition of the death penalty among its terms.As such, Turkey is legally bound not to reintroduce the death penalty.\n\nOn 20 July 2016, President Erdoğan announced a three-month state of emergency in response to the attempted coup, invoking Article 120 of the Constitution of Turkey (""Declaration of state of emergency because of widespread acts of violence and serious deterioration of public order"").Under the state of emergency, under Article 121, ""the Council of Ministers, meeting under the chairpersonship of the President of the Republic, may issue decrees having the force of law on matters necessitated by the state of emergency"", with decrees subject to subsequent parliamentary approval.The state of emergency was endorsed by the Parliament on 21 July by 346 votes to 115.The Justice and Development Party and the Nationalist Movement Party supported the state of emergency, whilst the Republican People\'s Party and the Peoples\' Democratic Party opposed it.Prime Minister Yıldırım said at the Parliament that the state of emergency was necessary to ""get rid of this scourge rapidly"".\n\nAs part of the state of emergency, deputy prime minister Kurtulmuş announced that Turkey was temporarily suspending part of the European Convention on Human Rights following the attempted coup, invoking Article 15 of the Convention (""war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation"").The suspensions must be notified to the Council of Europe and may not affect the right to a fair trial or the prohibition on torture.\n\nThis state of emergency in Turkey as well as the hindrance of the right to protest that occurred within such framework have been layered onto a longer history of emergency rules, oppressive legislation and daily government practice that have reinforced both.We can see from this the ""autocratisation"" process in Turkey has thrived of existing legal framework deeply associated in legacies of past ""emergencies"".\n\nOn 3 October 2016 Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş declared the governments intention to extend the state of emergency by a further three months raising objections from both the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) and Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) were critical of the governments use of their emergency powers and declared that they would vote against an extension.\n\nFollowing the National Security Council\'s recommendation for the extension President Erdoğan stated that it was possible that the state of emergency could last for longer than a year prompting outcry from the opposition, Leader of the Main Opposition Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu said that ""The president saying that the state of emergency can last longer than 12 months is strengthening the fear of a counter-coup"" and that it was ""raising the prospect of opportunist measures.""\n\nThe AKP\'s governmental majority allowed the three-month extension to take effect on 19 October 2016.The two-year-long state of emergency was ended on 19 July 2018.\n\nOn 16 July 2016, the media reported that eight Turkish military personnel of various ranks had landed in Greece\'s northeastern city of Alexandroupolis on board a Black Hawk helicopter and claimed political asylum in Greece.While the Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu demanded extradition of ""the eight traitors as soon as possible"", the Greek authorities stated: ""We will follow the procedures of international law.However, we give severe considerations to the fact that [the Turkish military men] are accused, in their own country, of violating the constitutional order and trying to overthrow democracy.""The helicopter was returned to Turkey shortly thereafter.The eight asylum seekers, their asylum case pending, were later transferred to Athens, mainly for safety reasons.On 26 January, the Supreme Court of Greece eventually ruled against their extradition, on the grounds that the eight were unlikely to face a fair trial if returned to their home country and due to concerns over their safety.\n\nOn 15 February 2017, five Turkish commandos illegally entered Greece through the Evros river.However, once they entered the country, the group split.The two of them surrendered to the police and on 20 February 2017, requested political asylum.They were being held in the city of Alexandroupolis.The two men belonged to the Turkish navy.The names given by the two reportedly match the names of two fugitives wanted in relation to the shadowy operation against Erdoğan himself.The Greek government mentioned that the Greek authorities will not allow the country to be dragged into the ongoing feud between the Turkish state and the followers of Gulen.But there were no sign of the other three.According to a lawyer there were indications that the other three have been arrested by Greek authorities who were about to expel them to Turkey.According to new evidence and new information these three ""arrested"" marines were delivered under fast and informal procedures from Greek to Turkish services.\n\nAfter the coup attempt, two Turkish military attachés in Athens, Staff Col. İlhan Yaşıtlı and naval attaché Col. Halis Tunç, had reportedly disappeared along with their families.The Greek foreign ministry canceled the two attachés\' accreditations on 7 August 2016, upon the request of the Turkish foreign ministry.Greek media reported that they might have fled to Italy.On 11 August 2016, the Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu confirmed the reports saying that they had left Greece for Italy on 6 August and adding that Turkey would officially ask the Italian authorities to extradite the two soldiers.\n\nOn 9 August 2016, the media reported that Turkey\'s Rear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been on a United States-based assignment for NATO and after the coup was subject to a detention order in Turkey, had sought asylum in the United States.\n\nIn mid-November 2016, it was officially confirmed that about 40 Turkish military servicemen of various ranks stationed at NATO command structures had applied for asylum in Germany and Belgium.\n\nIn January 2017, Der Spiegel magazine and ARD broadcaster reported that about 40 mostly high-ranking Turkish soldiers who worked at NATO facilities in Germany requested asylum in Germany.\n\nAt the end of February 2017, Germany said it had received 136 asylum requests from Turks holding diplomatic passports since the July coup attempt.The figure was a total for August 2016 to January 2017; some were presumed to be military officers posted to NATO bases in Germany.\n\nIn November 2016, NATO\'s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that Turkish NATO Officers had requested asylum in the countries where they had been posted.He did not name the nations involved or the number of officers, saying it was a matter for those countries to decide.He said: ""Some Turkish officers working in NATO command structure ... have requested asylum in the countries where they are working. ...As always, this is an issue that is going to be assessed and decided by the different NATO allies as a national issue.""\n\nAs of March 2017, Norway have granted asylum for four Turkish soldiers and a military attache.\n\nSeveral Turkish citizens with diplomatic passports have sought political asylum in Switzerland.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, detainees in Turkey have been denied access to legal counsel, have been beaten and tortured.They have not been provided with adequate food, water, or medical care.At least one has attempted suicide.Amnesty International wanted the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture to send people to check on detainees conditions.A person who had been on duty at the Ankara police headquarters said that police denied medical treatment to a detainee.""Let him die.We will say he came to us dead,"" the witness quoted a police doctor as saying.\n\nAlso, Erdoğan has extended the maximum period of detention for suspects from four days to 30, a move Amnesty said increased the risk of torture or other maltreatment of detainees.\n\nTurkish Justice Ministry denied the reports and the Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said on his Twitter account: ""There has not been any torture or assault of detainees in custody,"" in response to reports by Amnesty International.""The claims of torture and assault make up a pre-packaged misinformation campaign formed by members of FETÖ, one which is untrue and distorted,""\n\nOn 7 August, between three and five million people gathered for an anti-coup rally organized by the Turkish authorities in Istanbul.President Erdoğan and the two leaders of the major opposition parties (the Republican People\'s Party and the Nationalist Movement Party) were present.\n\nGreek authorities on several Aegean islands have called for emergency measures to curtail a growing flow of refugees from Turkey; the number of migrants and refugees willing to make the journey across the Aegean has increased noticeably after the failed coup.At Athens officials voiced worries because Turkish monitors overseeing the deal in Greece had been abruptly pulled out after the failed coup without being replaced.Also, the mayor of Kos expressed concern in a letter to the Greek Prime Minister citing the growing influx of refugees and migrants after the failed coup.The Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises (SETE) warned about the prospect of another flare-up in the refugee/migrant crisis due to the Turkish political instability.\n\nVincent Cochetel, the director of the Europe Bureau of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in August 2016 that parts of the EU-Turkey deal about immigration were already de facto suspended because no Turkish police were present at Greek detention centres to oversee deportations.\n\nOn 25 August 2016, seven Turkish citizens sought asylum in Greece.Two were university professors, and their two children applied for asylum in Alexandroupoli after they illegally entered the country from the northeastern border.Also, three businessmen illegally reached the Greek island of Rhodes, and they also applied for asylum.\n\nOn 30 August 2016, a Turkish judge arrived at the Greek island of Chios on a migrant boat, with six Syrian nationals, and sought asylum in the country.He told the Greek coastguard and police officers that he is being persecuted in Turkey for his political beliefs by President Tayyip Erdoğan.The Turkish judge had been arrested for illegally entering the country and was transferred to Athens for his asylum proceedings.The Syrian nationals claimed refugee status.\n\nOn 11 September 2016, four Turkish civilians were arrested by Turkish police.An academic and a teacher attempted to escape to Greece illegally by crossing the Evros river, and the other two because they organized the escape attempt.The academic and the teacher paid a total of 12,500 euros in Istanbul to arrange their escape to Greece.Before their attempt, both the academic and the teacher were suspended from their duties as part of the ongoing probe into the failed coup attempt.Police also seized an air raft, an oar and a pump while detaining the suspects.The court later ordered the two\'s release while the other two suspects, who organized the escape attempt, were arrested.\n\nOn 21 September 2016, ten Turkish civilians, two men, two women and six children landed by boat illegally on the Greek island of Rhodes and sought asylum.They told the Greek authorities they were working in the private sector in Turkey and the Turkish government was persecuting them due to their political beliefs.\n\nOn 29 September 2016, five Turkish nationals, a couple and their child and two other men, arrived in Greece, at Alexandroupolis by crossing the Evros River by boat illegally and requested political asylum.\n\nOn 12 December 2016, one female Turkish national, landed by boat, full of refugees and immigrants, illegally on the Greek island of Lesbos.She requested political asylum.\n\nOn 24 October 2017, Turkish authorities obtained information that 995 Turks have applied for asylum in Greece after the coup attempt.\n\nMore than 1,800 Turkish citizens requested asylum in Greece in 2017.\n\nOn 18 February 2018, seventeen Turkish nationals, including six children, requested asylum in Greece at Oinousses island.\n\nIn August 2018, the former lawmaker for the Peoples\' Democratic Party, Leyla Birlik, requested asylum in Greece after illegally crossing the border near Alexandroupolis.\n\nBerlin mayor, Michael Müller (SPD), said Turkey was waging war on supporters of the Gülen movement in Germany.He said that Turkish officials had approached him and asked him whether he would be prepared to confront the Gülen movement in Berlin critically and, if necessary, to support measures against it.The mayor rejected the idea and made it very clear that Turkish conflicts could not be waged in the city.\n\nDer Spiegel presented classified documents, which showed that Turkey\'s secret service (MIT) had asked Germany\'s foreign intelligence agency (BND) for help in rounding up Gülen supporters in Germany.The Turkish secret service wanted the BND to use its influence to spur German lawmakers into taking action against Gülen supporters and extraditing them to Turkey.Also, Turkey\'s government has sent German authorities requests for searches and extraditions linked to supporters of Fethullah Gülen in Germany.\n\nIn Germany businesses thought to be in support of the Gülen movement have been harassed by Erdoğan supporters.\n\nAfter the failed coup, there was a massive demonstration in Cologne at Germany, in late July, in support of Turkish President Erdoğan.Erdoğan wanted to address the participants via video but was rejected by the local authorities and the German Constitutional Court due to security concerns.Turkey said that the ban was unacceptable and a violation of freedom of expression.\n\nGerman authorities said Turkish mosques in Germany were playing Turkish politics and worried that Turkey\'s internal politics spilled over into German cities.For years, German authorities had encouraged Turkey\'s state-run religious institution Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs usually referred to as DİTİB to provide Islamic preachers and teachers and Gülen Movement Schools for the large Turkish diaspora in Germany.DİTİB manages some 900 mosques in Germany.Gülen movement runs 100 educational facilities in Germany.\n\nAfter the failed coup DİTİB published a sermon praising ""our noble nation"" for rising against ""a wretched network"" that had sown ""seeds of sedition, rebellion and hostility.""According to Volker Beck, a member of the center-left Greens in Germany\'s Bundestag, ""That was not a religious text.It was a declaration of obedience to Mr. Erdoğan and his measures since the coup attempt,"" Volker Kauder, parliamentary group leader of the Germany\'s ruling Christian Democrats, the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU)/Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) faction, said Turkish-Germans should be loyal to Germany first and foremost.\n\nGermans of Turkish origin are being pressured in Germany by informers and officers of Turkey\'s MIT spy agency.According to reports Turkey had 6,000 informants plus MIT officers in Germany who were putting pressure on ""German Turks"".Hans-Christian Ströbele said that there was an ""unbelievable"" level of ""secret activities"" in Germany by Turkey\'s MIT agency.According to Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, not even the former communist East German Stasi secret police had managed to run such a large ""army of agents"" in the former West Germany: ""Here, it\'s not just about intelligence gathering, but increasingly about intelligence service repression.""\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nGermany\'s Office for Migration and Refugees said on 18 November 2016, it had received 4,437 political asylum requests from Turkish citizens up to October, compared to 1,767 for the whole of last year.""We must expect that the number of Turks who are seeking political asylum in Germany will continue to rise,"" said Stephan Mayer, the domestic policy speaker of the union coalition in the Bundestag.\n\nOn 10 December 2016, eleven Turkish nationals, 10 adults and one child, in a martial arts group have applied for asylum in Germany.\n\nAs of January 2018, Germany was first place and Greece second as EU destinations of choice for Turkish nationals requesting asylum after the coup attempt.\n\nTurkish police have carried out simultaneous raids in 18 cities against companies associated with United States-based Fethullah Gülen.The state-run Anadolu Agency said police searched 204 premises and detained 187 businessmen for ""membership in a terror organization"" and ""providing financial support to a terror organization"".All suspects\' assets were seized.\n\nWikiLeaks released Turkish emails and documents to respond to the Turkish government\'s purges that followed the coup attempt.In turn, the Turkish Telecommunications Communications Board blocked access to the WikiLeaks website.On 17 July 2016 Wikileaks had announced on Twitter, the leak of approximately 300,000 emails and over 500,000 documents, including those to and from AKP.\n\nWikiLeaks stated that it was attacked shortly after 17 July announcement of the planned publication and hypothesized that Turkish authorities were responsible.WikiLeaks stated in a tweet, ""our infrastructure is under sustained attack.""Tweets from WikiLeaks include ""We are unsure of the true origin of the attack.The timing suggests a Turkish state power faction or its allies.We will prevail & publish.""and: ""Turks will likely be censored to prevent them reading our pending release of 100k+ docs on politics leading up to the coup."", ""We ask that Turks are ready with censorship bypassing systems such as TorBrowser and uTorrent""; ""And that everyone else is ready to help them bypass censorship and push our links through the censorship to come.""\n\nUpon the release of the email dump, it has been reported that the emails contain little to no damning information, and instead are just mails from a public mailing list, but also linked externally to ""voter information on all of the women registered to vote in 78 out of Turkey\'s 81 provinces"".\n\nSeveral places were renamed to commemorate the failed coup: Boğaziçi Köprüsü (Bosphorus Bridge) → 15 Temmuz Şehitler Köprüsü Kızılay Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Kızılay Demokrasi Meydanı Ahmet Taner Kışlalı Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Milli İrade Meydanı (Reverted to original name a few days later) Büyük İstanbul Otogarı → İstanbul 15 Temmuz Demokrasi Otogarı In TRT, Yeni Haber Stüdyosu → 15 Temmuz Millet Stüdyosu Kazan → Kahramankazan about the province\'s local people\'s resistance to the coup plotters.Kahraman means ""hero"" in Turkish Niğde University → Niğde Ömer Halisdemir University\n\nIn 2018, the Istanbul Municipal Council decided to change the names of a total of 90 streets that included words which could be associated with FETÖ.\n\nThe Presidency of Religious Affairs stated that it would not be providing religious funeral services to the dead coupists, except for ""privates and low-ranking officers compelled by force and threats who found themselves in the midst of the conflict without full knowledge of anything"".\n\nA document dated 26 September 2016 showed that Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) asked Turkish missions and religious representatives abroad to profile Gülen movement expatriates living in their respective foreign countries.Gülen-linked schools, businesses, foundations, associations, media outlets and others were also included in the reports.Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs has gathered intelligence via imams from 38 countries.\n\nBelgium officials said they would withdraw recognition of Diyanet mosques in the country if necessary.\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nOn 21 December 2016, the Turkish government has recalled Yusuf Acar, the religious affairs attaché of the Turkish Embassy in the Netherlands, after Dutch authorities said he was spying.Acar collected information of people who sympathize with Fethullah Gülen at Netherlands and passed it on to the Turkish authorities.The Dutch government called spying activities an ""unwanted and non-acceptable interference in the lives of Dutch citizens.""and the attaché was reportedly declared persona non grata and received a ""deportation warning"" by Dutch authorities.\n\nOn 26 January 2017, President Erdoğan, during his visit to Tanzania, asked his Tanzanian counterpart John Magufuli to take action against the network of Fethullah Gülen.\n\nIn April 2017 it was announced that President Erdoğan planned to establish a purpose-built museum dedicated to the coup events, called the ""Museum of the 15 July: Martyrs and Democracy"", to be located in Kahramankazan, a town near Ankara.Paid for by Turkish Ministry of Culture funds, it is planned to open at the end of 2018.The museum opened in December 2019\n\nAmong the Turkish opposition parties, the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) issued a statement expressing their public opposition to the coup, and the Hürriyet Daily News reported that Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bahçeli telephoned Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım to express his opposition to the coup.The co-chairs of the opposition Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) issued a statement saying that the party was ""under all circumstances and as a matter of principle against all kinds of coup.""Amongst the minor parties, left-wing nationalist Patriotic Party\'s Doğu Perinçek backed democracy, when he held Gülen and the Americans responsible.Kurdish militant separatist organization Kurdistan Workers\' Party, which Turkey and its allies label as a terrorist organization, urged their supporters to stay away from the coup and rather defend their people, while the Communist Party called upon the people to overthrow the AKP government which they called an ""enemy of humanity"".\n\nDuring the first hours of the coup plotters\' moves of blocking Istanbul\'s bridges and flying fighter jets low over Istanbul and Ankara, Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjørn Jagland tweeted against the coup attempt and underlined that ""any attempt to overthrow the democratically elected leaders is unacceptable"".\n\nRussia\'s President Vladimir Putin called Erdoğan out of solidarity before all NATO member countries\' heads following the coup attempt.Erdoğan thanked the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev – who was the first president to show solidarity after the coup attempt – for his support in solving the 7-month crisis over downed Russian Sukhoi Su-24 and the Prime Minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, who was among the first NATO country leaders to condemn the coup attempt, already from the early hours of Saturday.\n\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the then prime minister of Pakistan, was all praise for the people of Turkey and the AKP government and strongly condemned what he termed as an attempt to undermine democracy in Turkey.""We deeply admire the resolve of the brave and resilient Turkish people, who stood up against the forces of darkness and anarchy to express their support and commitment to democracy,"" the PM said in a statement issued from his office.\n\nThe majority of countries either expressed their support for the government or called for restraint.On 16 July 2016, however, a proposed United Nations Security Council statement denouncing the coup was not accepted by Egypt, a non-permanent member of the Council at the time, due to textual disagreements.Egyptian diplomats said that the council is ""in no position to qualify, or label [the Turkish] government – or any other government for that matter – as democratically elected or not"".Objection by the United States and the UK – permanent members of the Security Council – led to Egypt proposing a new statement calling for all sides to ""respect the democratic and constitutional principles and the rule of law"", which was rejected, preventing the condemnation of the coup attempt by the Security Council.The leader of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky supported the coup attempt.\n\nAl-Monitor reported that ""Unlike Ankara\'s Western allies, Iran did not wait for the coup\'s failure to speak up.Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif voiced support for democracy in a Twitter message in the early hours of the unrest, writing ""Stability, and democracy in Turkey are paramount"".In a subsequent phone call after the failure of the coup attempt, President Hassan Rouhani told Erdoğan the coup attempt was ""a test to identify your domestic and foreign friends and enemies.""An Iranian official pointed out parallels between the coup attempt in Turkey and the coup against Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mussadiq in 1953: ""What we know is that this attempt was triggered by foreign hands.We have experienced the same thing in the past.Since Mr. Erdogan wants to play a more positive path in the region today, they want to overthrow him.""\n\nMustafa Akıncı, President of Northern Cyprus, welcomed the fact that ""no community in Turkey ... applauded the coup as they have done in the past.""Azerbaijan strongly condemned the attempted military coup in Turkey and considered such actions unacceptable according to a statement from Novruz Mammadov, deputy head of the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration and chief of the foreign relations department.\n\nEuropean Commissioner dealing with Turkey\'s EU membership bid, Johannes Hahn, said it appears Turkey\'s government prepared arrest lists of political opponents before the coup attempt and had been waiting for the right time to act.In this sense, EU reported that as a main criticism to put this issue in the category of terrorism become the violation of the fundamental rights and fundamental values of the citizens.Hence, it underlines a total divergence of opinions and mentality between EU and Turkey which reached a deadlock here especially after the 15th of July in 2016.\n\nOn 19 July 2016, White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said during a press briefing that President Barack Obama has held a phone conversation with President Erdoğan: ""The President used the phone call to reiterate once again the strong commitment of the United States to the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey.The President pledged any needed assistance to the Turkish government as they conduct an investigation to determine exactly what happened.""\n\nOn 20 July 2016, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""Turkey has a large armed force, professional armed forces and ...I am certain they will continue as a committed and strong NATO ally.""On a statement released on 10 August 2016, the Secretary General once more strongly condemned the attempted coup and reiterated full support for Turkey\'s democratic institutions.He also expressed support for the elected Turkish government and respect for the courage of the Turkish people for resisting the coup plotters.\n\nOn 29 July 2016, the commander of U.S. Central Command, General Joseph Votel, denied statements by Turkey\'s president Erdoğan that he has supported the coup attempt in Turkey.\n\nOn 1 August 2016, United States Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, General Joseph Dunford, visited Turkey and condemned the coup attempt.Dunford said: ""The consistent theme throughout the day was a reaffirmation of the importance of the U.S.-Turkey relationship – the need for us to cooperate.""\n\nOn July, 20, there were reports that a group of Turkish military commandos coup fugitives would try to cross from Turkey to the island of Symi, in the southeastern Aegean, at Greece.The Hellenic Coast Guard was on alert and increased the patrols in the area, especially after a group of inflatable dinghies and other vessels were seen departing from Datça, on the Turkish coast, in the direction of Symi, they monitored the movements of the Turkish vessels, which remained in Turkish waters.Furthermore, a contingent of the Hellenic Police was dispatched to Symi to conduct checks there.The Greek government had been anticipating a possible attempt by participants in the failed coup to come to Greece and took the reports seriously.Turkish F-16 fighter jets were also scrambled to check reports that missing Turkish coast guard vessels had appeared in Greek waters in the Aegean.Later on the day, the Turkish interior ministry denied reports that rebel soldiers might have ""hijacked"" a vessel to flee to Greece.The Greek armed forces remained on alert the throughout the day for potential coup fugitives.\n\nAccording to Michael Rubin, from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Erdoğan had himself to blame for the coup.Following an increasingly Islamist agenda, Erdoğan had reportedly ""dropped any pretense of governing for all Turks.""After ""fanning the flames"" at the 2013 Gezi Park protests, he transformed the predominantly Kurdish-inhabited areas of southeastern Turkey ""into a war zone reminiscent of the worst days of the 1980s.""The biggest problem, according to Rubin, might have been Erdoğan\'s foreign policy, which managed to turn the initial ""no problems with neighbors"" doctrine into a situation where the country has problems with almost every neighbor and has even alienated some of its allies and friends.Rubin previously worked as an official at the Pentagon and less than 4 months before the coup, he wrote an article in Newsweek magazine titled, ""Will There Be a Coup Against Erdogan in Turkey?""\n\nBritish Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk warned that ""too late did Erdoğan realize the cost of the role he had chosen for his country.It\'s one thing to say sorry to Putin and patch up relations with Netanyahu; but when you can no longer trust your army, there are more serious matters to concentrate upon.""Even if this coup may have failed, Fisk expected another to follow in the months or years to come.\n\nTurkish professor Akın Ünver described the coup d\'état attempt as ""more of a mutiny"".\n\nThe name of the ""Peace at Home Council"" – Yurtta Sulh Konseyi – is derived from Atatürk\'s famous saying \'Peace at Home, Peace in the World\'.Journalist Ezgi Başaran said that ""the statement of the junta, that was [...] read on the [...] government TV [channel] as the coup got under way, bore a strong resemblance to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk\'s famous address to the Turkish Youth.[...] On the other hand, given that these references are too obvious, they may have been intentionally included to insinuate a Kemalist junta rather than a Gülenist one.""\n\nThe citizen journalism site Bellingcat published an analysis of the messages of a WhatsApp group consisting of high-ranking military officials who had taken part in the coup covering their activities including them killing several people.The messages were cross referenced with video footage.The group was named ""Yurtta sulh"" which refers to a peace at home speech and they seem secular and military with no references to Gülen or anything related during the several hours of messaging.\n\nNews reports have suggested that the coup ringleader was Adil Öksüz.Some believe Öksüz to have been an operative with Turkish intelligence.\n\nGerman Islamic studies scholar said the putschists tried to forestall a large-scale purge of judiciary and military, the implementation of which had already started on Saturday, the day after the coup attempt.According to Turkish investigative journalist Ahmet Şık, a list of officials to be purged had been ready compiled by the attorney-general of Izmir, Okan Bato, and was approved by President Erdoğan.According to this version, the putschists had to quickly bring forward their coup attempt before being disposed and arrested.\n\nDuring and after the events, several politicians and commentators suggested that the government knew about the coup in advance and possibly directed it.The facts that the coup attempt began in the evening rather than at a more inconspicuous time and that the events were largely confined to Ankara and Istanbul contributed to doubts about the authenticity of the coup attempt.Journalists and opposition politicians branded it a \'tragic comedy\' and \'theatre play\'.Advocates of such theories pointed to how Erdoğan stood to gain from the coup attempt in terms of increasing his popularity and support for his calls for an executive presidency, while being able to legitimize further crackdowns on judicial independence and the opposition in general.\n\nOther elements that were reported to support the theory included: no list of demands by the coup plotters, the organization and response of the police, the long lists of arrests that seemed to be ready surprisingly quickly (including arrests of 2,745 judges and 2,839 soldiers), and the obvious nature of the coup actions.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom Erdoğan had said as being one of the principal conspirators, commented, ""I don\'t believe that the world believes the accusations made by President Erdoğan.There is a possibility that it could be a staged coup and it could be meant for further accusations [against the Gülenists].""Journalist Cengiz Çandar, a veteran observer of Turkey\'s coups, said ""I have never seen any with this magnitude of such inexplicable sloppiness.""Prominent Hizmet (Gülen movement) spokesman Alp Aslandogan said, referencing that the Turkish Air Force commander met with Erdoğan before 15 July, that certain legal documentation related to the coup seemed written beforehand, arguing that within ""the indictment written by a prosecutor on the night of 15 July to 16 July, there were events there that didn\'t actually happen.Some events did happen, but those events didn\'t happen by the time the document started.It looks like a bigger plan was there, and part of the plan did not come to pass.""\n\nThe organization and spontaneous synchronization by large numbers of mosques was perceived to be unachievable unless there had been prior preparation, with journalists also pointing to how Erdoğan could have strategically used the call to prayer to invoke religious sentiment in a political situation as a veiled attack on state secularism.\n\nThousands of arrests and purges were conducted by Turkish authorities between 16 and 18 July 2016.The sheer number of these arrests made at such a speed could only be done so if the ""Turkish government had all those lists ready"", as suggested by Johannes Hahn, European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, on 18 July 2016.Hahn also said that because these lists were already available immediately after the coup, the ""event was prepared"" and the lists were to be used ""at a certain stage"".\n\nMehmet Dişli, who was seen giving orders to the coup plotters and who was the one who put a belt around Hulusi Akar\'s neck to make him sign, is the brother of Şaban Dişli, a former vice president of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and confidant of Erdoğan.\n\nSeveral social media users have compared the coup attempt to the Reichstag fire in 1933, which Adolf Hitler used as an excuse to suspend civil liberties and order mass arrests of his opponents.Politico correspondent Ryan Heath said that ""the coup was staged to allow Erdoğan to purge the military of opponents and increase his grip on the country"".Heath used Twitter to share comments from his Turkish source, who called the events of Friday night a ""fake coup"" which would help a ""fake democracy warrior"" (referring to Erdoğan).The source said: ""Probably we\'ll see an early election [in] which he\'ll try to guarantee an unbelievable majority of the votes.And this will probably guarantee another 10–15 years of authoritarian, elected dictatorship.""\n\nThe New York Times reported that some Turkish citizens believed the coup attempt was staged by Erdoğan to improve his public image and popularity, while cracking down on political opponents and expanding his power.Critics found it suspect that reportedly no government officials were arrested or harmed during the attempted coup, which—among other factors—raised the suspicion of a false flag event staged by the Turkish government to crack down on opposition parties.Those in Turkey suggesting that the coup was staged are also being questioned by the government.\n\nPoliticians and journalists who were skeptical of the authenticity of the coup plot said that in reality, a \'civil coup\' had effectively been staged against the Armed Forces and Judiciary, both of which were extensively purged of stated Gülen supporters by the government shortly after the events.Skeptics said that the coup would be used as an excuse for further erosion of judicial independence and a crackdown on the opposition, giving the AKP greater and unstoppable power over all state institutions and paving the way for a more radical Islamist agenda at odds with the founding principles of the Turkish Republic.\n\nJustice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said in late July 2016 that Turkish social media users who said the government was staging the coup faced investigation: ""Just look at the people who are saying on social media that this was theatre.Public prosecutors are already investigating them.Most of them are losers who think it is an honor to die for Fethullah Gülen\'s command.""\n\nOn 12 July 2017, Stockholm Center for Freedom, a monitoring group with reported links to the Gülen movement, published a controversial report stating that President Erdogan orchestrated the coup bid as a false flag to consolidate his powers, set up his opposition for a mass persecution, and push Turkish Armed Forces into a military incursion into Syria.According to the report, it uncovered new evidence from 11 July 2016, four days before the planned coup bid, that a secret plan was circulated among select group of Armed Forces to give an appearance of a coup attempt.The plan was sanctioned by intelligence and military chiefs with the approval of Erdogan.\n\nIn early November 2017, Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for , former Director of the Middle East Program of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, stating that he is an agent of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), that he was present in Istanbul during the 2016 Turkish coup attempt, and that he was one of the key organizers behind the coup attempt.Around 1 December, the Istanbul prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for Graham E. Fuller, an American author and political analyst specializing in Islamic extremism after a long CIA career and holding the role of vice-chair of the United States National Intelligence Council.The prosecutor\'s office based the warrant on suspicion of Fuller helping to plan the coup attempt.Hürriyet stated that Turkish authorities believed that they had traced Fuller\'s location before the attempted coup and afterward when he left Turkey.\n\nBarkey denied his reported role in the coup, describing the claims as ""so ludicrous that they do not even deserve the term \'science fiction\'.""\n\nDeep state in Turkey The Imam\'s Army List of coups and coup attempts since 2010 List of modern conflicts in the Middle East List of attacks on legislatures\n', 'Claim_Context': 'In March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.

105,"{'Wiki_Title': '2016 Turkish coup attempt', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'On 15 July 2016, a faction within the Turkish Armed Forces, organized as the Peace at Home Council, attempted a coup d\'état against state institutions, including the government and president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.They attempted to seize control of several places in Ankara, Istanbul, Marmaris and elsewhere, such as the Asian side entrance of the Bosphorus Bridge, but failed to do so after forces and civilians loyal to the state defeated them.The Council cited an erosion of secularism, elimination of democratic rule, disregard for human rights, and Turkey\'s loss of credibility in the international arena as reasons for the coup.The government said it had evidence the coup leaders were linked to the Gülen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the Republic of Turkey and led by Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish businessman and a well-known Islamic scholar who lives in exile in Pennsylvania.The Turkish government alleged that Gülen was behind the coup (which Gülen denied) and that the United States was harboring him.Events surrounding the coup attempt and the purges in its aftermath reflect a complex power struggle between Islamist elites in Turkey.\n\nDuring the coup attempt, over 300 people were killed and more than 2,100 were injured.Many government buildings, including the Turkish Parliament and the Presidential Palace, were bombed from the air.Mass arrests followed, with at least 40,000 detained, including at least 10,000 soldiers and 2,745 judges, for being affiliated with the coup attempt.15,000 education staff were also suspended and the licenses of 21,000 teachers working at private institutions were revoked after the government stated they were loyal to Gülen.More than 77,000 people have been arrested and over 160,000 fired from their jobs, on reports of connections to Gülen.\n\nThere were many reactions against the coup attempt, both domestically and internationally.The main opposition parties in Turkey condemned the attempt, while several international leaders—such as those of the United States, NATO, the European Union, and neighboring countries—called for ""respect of the democratic institutions in Turkey and its elected officials.""Many international organizations also opposed the coup.The United Nations Security Council, however, did not denounce the coup after disagreements over the phrasing of a statement.Iran opposed the coup and advised Erdogan to defeat the coup plotters.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the head of United States Central Command, General Joseph Votel, was ""siding with coup plotters"", after Votel criticized the Turkish government for arresting the Pentagon\'s contacts in Turkey.\n\nIn March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.The same month, the British Parliament\'s Foreign Affairs Select Committee said some Gulenists were involved in the coup d\'état attempt but found no hard evidence that Fethullah Gülen masterminded the failed coup and found no evidence to justify the United Kingdom designating the Gülen movement as a ""terrorist organization"".\n\nSince the 1970s, followers of the influential cleric Fethullah Gülen had assumed increasingly important positions within the Turkish state apparatus.Gülen several times advised his followers to take key positions in society and government, if necessary with a secret identity to avoid opposition from the laicistic Turkish army and government.Nevertheless, at the start of the 21st century, Gülen\'s followers achieved crucial positions of power in Turkey (and beyond) with a vast network of newspapers, TV channels, schools, associations, lobby organizations, financial institutions and positions within the state such as the army and the judiciary.Initially, the then Prime Minister Erdogan seemingly tolerated the power of the Gülen movement because of common interests such as limiting the undemocratic political power of the military, but also because of impotence and fear of Gülen\'s power within Turkey.\n\nA series of events eventually led to a rift between Erdogan and Gülen.For example, prosecutors that allegedly were aligned with the Gülen movement tried to arrest the intelligence chief Hakan Fidan for the peace negotiations with the PKK, and by extension PM Erdogan subsequently, as the Turkish secret service is directly subordinate to the prime minister of Turkey.During this period (2010-2013), state secrets were leaked, fraud was committed with the entrance exams for government employees (KPSS), a change of power occurred at the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) and (sex)tapes of both government members and opposition members were leaked.Following these events and other incidents, the Turkish government decided to designate the Gülen movement as parallel state and FETÖ (Fethullahist Terror Organization).Alleged Gülen supporters were fired or arrested.The coup attempt that followed is therefore also described by some analysts as a last desperate attempt by Gülenists to retain power.\n\nIt is widely reported that Kemalist ideology played a huge role in motivating the 15 July 2016 coup attempt, like all previous political interventions in the history of Turkey\'s military coups.Since the establishment of multiparty democracy in Turkey in 1946, the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), together with the judiciary, have viewed themselves as guardians of Kemalist ideals and the secular Turkish nationalist state established under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk against political parties that have promoted a larger role for Islam and minorities in public life.The military and judiciary have regularly intervened in politics to block or ban popular parties representing conservative Muslim Turks, attempting to relax the restrictions on traditional religious practices, such as women\'s wearing of headscarves.The military has toppled four elected governments: by coups in 1960 and 1980, and by military decisions in 1971 and 1997.The military has also banned several major political parties.In 1998, Erdoğan, then-mayor of Istanbul, was banned for life from politics and jailed because he had read a religious poem by Ziya Gökalp several years before, at a public meeting.In 2007, the military expressed its opposition to the election of Abdullah Gül, of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), as president, by issuing an e-memorandum.Still, Gül was eventually elected when the AKP won both a referendum on the matter.Also, a snap election, and the party returned with a larger majority in the parliament.The military cited erosion of secularism as one of the reasons for the coup in the statement published on the day of the coup.\n\nAs opposed to previous political interventions by the Turkish military, Turkey\'s AKP government and pro-state media maintain that the 15 July 2016 coup attempt was not motivated by allegiance to Kemalist ideology, but rather to the vast political, economic, and religious network led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen.Between 2007 and 2012, high-profile Kemalists, including high-ranking officers of the Turkish Armed Forces, faced a series of trials and purges, under reports of involvement in a secret society codenamed ""Ergenekon.""Supported by Islamist (both pro-Gülen and pro-Erdoğan) prosecutors, security officials, and media, the purges allowed lower-rank Islamist officers to assume high-ranking military positions.They were seen as a bid by Turkey\'s civilian leaders under President Erdoğan to establish dominance over the military.In these trials in 2013 – viewed as ""sensational"" and ""one of the biggest in recent Turkish history"" – 275 people, including senior military officers, journalists, lawyers, and academics, were said to be involved in the so-called ""Ergenekon"" conspiracy, reportedly plotting a coup in 2003/04 against then–Prime Minister Erdoğan.Additionally, some military officers were said to be involved in a separate reported plot, Sledgehammer.Simultaneously, Erdoğan promoted lower-ranking officers up the chain of command, ensuring that the military chief of staff was loyal to him and thereby demoralizing the army.\n\nThe AKP\'s alliance with Gülen started to collapse during 2013 as Gülenists targeted the AKP using corruption charges.After the split, Erdoğan decided it would be advantageous to rehabilitate the army.The ""Ergenekon"" convictions were overturned in April 2016 by the Court of Cassation, which ruled that the existence of the network was unproven.\n\nIn 2013, law enforcement efforts to fight corruption, which had led to the 2013 corruption scandal in Turkey, were faulted by Erdoğan.The anti-corruption efforts were a source of tension between the Gülenists and the AKP.In political analysis in the months prior to the coup attempt, the incidence of corruption was reported to be ""rife"" in Turkey.Following the coup attempt, some coup leaders cited corruption as a reason for their actions.\n\nOn 13 July, less than two days before the coup was launched, Erdoğan signed a bill giving Turkish soldiers immunity from prosecution while taking part in domestic operations.The bill requires cases against commanders to be approved by the prime minister, while district governors may sign cases against lower-ranking soldiers.The immunity bill was seen as part of the détente between the government and the armed forces.The latter has increasingly been taking over military operations in Kurdish-inhabited areas from police and paramilitary units.\n\nOn 15 July 2016, as reported just before 23:00 EEST (UTC+3), military jets were spotted flying over Ankara, and both the Fatih Sultan Mehmet and Bosphorus bridges in Istanbul were closed.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said military action was being ""taken outside the chain of command"" and it was an ""illegal attempt"" to seize power by ""part of the military"".He further said that those involved ""will pay the highest price.""Local media also reported tanks in Istanbul\'s Atatürk Airport.It was reported that Internet users within Turkey were blocked from accessing Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.Twitter later stated that it had ""no reason to think we\'ve been fully blocked"".Some hostages were taken at military headquarters, including the Turkish Chief of the General Staff Hulusi Akar.At around 21:00, the coupists had invited Salih Zeki Çolak, the commander of the Turkish Land Forces to the military headquarters.When he arrived, he was immediately apprehended.Abidin Ünal, head of the Turkish Air Force, who had been attending a wedding in Istanbul, was abducted from there by soldiers who descended from a helicopter.The coupists then tried to force Akar to sign the coup declaration, almost strangling him using a belt in the process.He refused and was then taken to the Akıncı Air Base and other commanders at the headquarters.The military also entered the Justice and Development Party\'s offices in Istanbul and asked people to leave.\n\nEarly reports said President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was safe in Marmaris, south-west Turkey, where he had been on holiday.\n\nFrom around 23:00 to midnight, helicopters bombed the police special forces headquarters and police air force headquarters in Gölbaşı, just outside of Ankara.The attacks left 42 dead and 43 injured.Türksat headquarters in Gölbaşı was also attacked, killing two security personnel.\n\nAt around 23:50, soldiers occupied Taksim Square in central Istanbul.\n\nAt 00:02, it was reported by Reuters that soldiers were inside the buildings of the state broadcaster, the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), in Ankara.During the coup attempt, soldiers forced anchor Tijen Karaş to read out a statement saying that ""the democratic and secular rule of law has been eroded by the current government"" and that Turkey was now led by the Peace at Home Council who would ""ensure the safety of the population.""The statement read in part: ""Turkish Armed Forces have completely taken over the administration of the country to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedoms, the rule of law and general security that was damaged.[...] All international agreements are still valid.We hope that all of our good relationships with all countries will continue.""The plotters said they had ""done so to preserve democratic order, and that the rule of law must remain a priority"".The statement also ordered temporary martial law (sıkıyönetim), and said a new constitution would be prepared ""as soon as possible"".TRT was then taken off air.\n\nOther media outlets were also raided by the putschists, such as Turkish newspaper Hürriyet and private broadcaster CNN Türk.\n\nReuters reported on 15 July that an EU source described the coup as ""well orchestrated,"" and predicted that ""given the scale of the operation, it is difficult to imagine they will stop short of prevailing.""Another EU diplomat said that the Turkish ambassador in his capital was shocked and ""taking it very seriously"".\n\nThe Peace at Home Council was reportedly chaired by Muharrem Köse.\n\nAdana: Upon receiving the intelligence that thirty soldiers from the 10th Air Base Command would move to the base where the regional and provincial gendarmerie commands were located, the police prevented the soldiers from leaving the guardhouse with TOMA and armored vehicles and blocked them.Bitlis: In the Tatvan district of Bitlis, on the orders of Brigade Commander Arif Seddar Afşar, helicopters were circulated in the skies of Tatvan and fired at the city.The brigade command left the municipality\'s construction equipment in front of the barracks in case there was a tank operation in the district.Denizli: Approximately five hundred officers and non-commissioned officers who participated in the coup attempt surrendered to the gendarmerie and police forces.They were interrogated at Çardak District Gendarme Command.Kars: With the order of Kars 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, the soldiers who came with tanks and armored personnel carriers surrounded the Police Headquarters building and wanted to detain Faruk Karaduman, the chief of police.At the same hours, the invitation of Deputy Governors, 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, went to the command.Kocaeli: Turkcell\'s data center in Gebze was raided by soldiers who participated in the coup attempt.Soldiers who tried to interrupt the internet service were detained.Malatya: A rebellious soldier opened fire inside a base of the Turkish 2nd Army, damaging six vehicles.The base was besieged by police and loyal soldiers, and the shooter was captured.Marmaris: Three military helicopters carried out a bomb attack on the hotel where Erdoğan was staying.Forty rebellious soldiers of the Special Forces Command clashed with the police in the region.Mersin: Mersin Garrison and Mediterranean Region Commander Admiral Nejat Atilla Demirhan called Mersin Provincial Police Deputy Chief Yakup Usta and Gendarmerie Colonel Mustafa Bakçepınar and stated that the Turkish Armed Forces had taken over the administration.He introduced himself as the martial law garrison commander and ordered Mersin Governor Özdemir Çakacak and district governors to be taken into custody.Demirhan and Dağdelen, who made the same announcement with the police radio obtained from Mersin Police Department, were detained through the operation of the security forces.Sakarya: Sakarya Governorship was captured with armored personnel carriers, military trucks and many military jeeps from the military unit in the Kandıra district of Kocaeli.As a reinforcement, two military vehicles full of soldiers from the Sakarya central division command had to return to their barracks in the face of the resistance of the police and the harsh reaction of the people who took to the streets against the putschists.The vehicles occupying the Sakarya Governorate were seized by the citizens and the soldiers in them were neutralized and handed over to the security forces.Afterwards, citizens and security forces entered the governor\'s office and neutralized the soldiers there and suppressed the uprising in the province.Eight civilian citizens were injured as a result of the fire opened by the military during the incident.Şırnak: Çakırsöğüt Gendarmerie Commando Brigadier General Ali Osman Gürcan and 309 soldiers, that participated in the coup attempt, were detained by the security forces.\n\nTurkey\'s Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım responded to the events by stating that an ""illegal action is taking place outside of the chain of command"".He also said that ""the government elected by the people remains in charge and this government will only go when the people say so.""The Turkish Presidential office said President Erdoğan was on holiday inside Turkey and condemned the coup attempt as an attack on democracy.A presidential source also said Erdoğan and his government were still in power.The first messages from Erdoğan were transmitted at around 00:23At about 01:00, Erdoğan did a FaceTime interview with CNN Türk, in which he called upon his supporters to take to the streets in defiance of the military-imposed curfew, saying ""There is no power higher than the power of the people.Let them do what they will at the public squares and airports.""Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş appeared on live television, saying Turkey\'s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is still in charge of the government.The mayor of Ankara, Melih Gökçek of the AKP, encouraged people to go out to the city\'s streets in defiance, despite a curfew imposed by the military.Erdoğan\'s plane took off from Dalaman Airport near Marmaris at 23:47, but had to wait in the air south of Atatürk for the airport to be secured.His plane landed at 02:50\n\nThe First Army General Command in Istanbul stated in a news conference that the TSK did not support the coup and the perpetrators represented a tiny faction that were on the verge of being brought under control.Istanbul Atatürk Airport was closed; all flights from the airport were cancelled.There was an explosion in the TRT broadcasting headquarters and gunfire was reported in Ankara.Soon after, it was stormed by a crowd of civilians and police, with four soldiers inside reportedly being ""neutralized"".The channel went back on air and Karaş, who had previously announced the coup, said live that she had been held hostage and forced to read the declaration of the coup at gunpoint.\n\nBy 01:00, it was reported that the military had pulled its forces from the Atatürk airport and people were coming inside, but by 01:13, it was reported that tanks were inside the airport and gunfire was heard.\n\nTanks opened fire near the Turkish Parliament Building.The parliamentary building was also hit from the air.Injuries were reported among protesters following gunfire on Bosphorus Bridge.\n\nA helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was shot down by a Turkish military F-16 fighter jet.There were also reports of pro-state jets flying over Ankara to ""neutralize"" helicopters used by those behind the coup.\n\nAt 03:08, a military helicopter opened fire on the Turkish parliament.At 03:10, Turkish Armed Forces stated on their website that they had complete control over the country.At 03:12, Yıldırım made a statement saying that the situation was under control and that a no-fly zone was declared over Ankara and that military planes that still flew would be shot down.\n\nIt was reported that the Turkish parliament had been bombed again at 03:23 and 03:33.A helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was also seen flying by it.Half an hour following the report of 12 deaths and 2 injuries in the parliament, soldiers entered CNN Türk\'s headquarters and forced the studio to go off air.After an hour of interruption by the pro-coup soldiers, CNN Türk resumed its broadcast.Later, İsmail Kahraman said a bomb exploded at a corner of the public relations building inside the parliament, with no deaths but several injuries among police officers.\n\nAt around 04:00 two or three helicopters attacked Erdogan\'s hotel.According to eyewitness accounts, ten to fifteen heavily armed men landed and started firing.In the ensuing conflict, two policemen were killed and 8 were injured.\n\nThe Doğan News Agency reported that in Istanbul several individuals were injured after soldiers fired on a group of people attempting to cross the Bosphorus Bridge in protest of the attempted coup.\n\nOn Saturday 16 July 2016, at 00:42 EEST (UTC+3), a Turkish Black Hawk helicopter sent a distress signal and requested permission from Greek authorities for an emergency landing, and landed eight minutes later (00:50) at the Dimokritos airport in Alexandroupoli, in Greece, while two Greek F-16s observed the procedure and escorted it to the airport.The first reports said that the passengers were seven military personnel and a civilian.Later, it turned out that all were military personnel (two majors, four captains and two non-commissioned officers).They had removed the badges and insignia from their uniforms, making it impossible to know their rank.All were arrested after landing for illegal entry into the country.They were transferred to the local police station, while the Greek authorities at the airport guarded the helicopter.The eight passengers all requested political asylum in Greece as they believed they would not get a fair trial in Turkey.On 21 September 2016, Greece denied three out of the eight asylum.The men\'s lawyer Stavroula Tomara said they would be appealing the decision and said they had the ""impression that the decision has been predetermined, and that the interview was conducted just as a formality.""On 11 October 2016, four more of the eight were denied asylum.Two of the men who had previously been denied asylum applied for a re-evaluation but their applications were also rejected.\n\nAfter Erdoğan flew into Istanbul, he made a televised speech inside the airport at around 04:00, whilst thousands gathered outside.He addressed a crowd of supporters in the airport, at about 06:30 He said, ""In Turkey, armed forces are not governing the state or leading the state.They cannot.""He blamed ""those in Pennsylvania"" (a reference to Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, and his Hizmet Movement) for the coup attempt.Erdoğan also said he had plans to ""clean up"" the army, saying that ""This uprising is a gift from God to us.""State-run Anadolu Agency named former Colonel Muharrem Köse, who in March 2016 was dishonorably discharged for reported association with Gülen, as the suspected leader of the coup.However, the Alliance for Shared Values, a non-profit organization associated with Gülen, released a statement reiterating that it condemns any military intervention in domestic politics, and saying Erdoğan\'s allegations against the movement were ""highly irresponsible"".Gülen himself said in a brief statement just before midnight: ""As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nReuters reported that in early hours of 16 July, the coup appeared to have ""crumbled"" as crowds defied pro-coup military orders and gathered in major squares of Istanbul and Ankara to oppose it.Reuters also reported pro-coup soldiers surrendering to the police in Taksim Square, Istanbul.It was reported that by 05:18, Atatürk airport had completely been recaptured by the government whilst the police had surrounded the coupists inside the Turkish army headquarters, calling for them to surrender.Between 06:00–08:00 a skirmish took place there.In Akar\'s absence, Ümit Dündar, head of the First Army, was appointed Acting Chief of Staff.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning of 16 July, soldiers blocking the Bosphorus Bridge surrendered to the police.According to the government-run Anadolu Agency, this consisted of a group of 50 soldiers.Some of these soldiers were lynched by civilians despite the police\'s efforts, who fired into the air to protect the surrendering soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile, in the headquarters of the Turkish Army, 700 unarmed soldiers surrendered as the police conducted an operation into the building while 150 armed soldiers were kept inside by the police.The coupists in the TRT building in Istanbul surrendered in the early morning as well.Chief of Staff Akar, held hostage at the Akıncı Air Base in Ankara, was also rescued by pro-state forces.\n\nOne of the primary reasons that the coup failed was chaos among the plotters\' ranks.Turkey\'s National Intelligence Organization (MİT) head Hakan Fidan discovered the coup plot, and the plotters were forced to execute the coup five hours ahead of schedule.One of the main organizers, General Semih Terzi, was shot dead by loyalist Sgt.Maj.Ömer Halisdemir at the onset, demoralizing and disrupting command and control of the rebels.These two incidents resulted in the coup being carried out in an uncoordinated manner.The highest ranking staff officers opposed the coup, and publicly ordered all personnel to return to their barracks.Acting outside the military chain of command, the rebels lacked the coordination and resources to achieve their goals.The conscripted soldiers that the rebels mobilized were uninformed of their mission\'s true purpose and became demoralized.Many surrendered rather than shoot demonstrators.The commander of the First Army in Istanbul, General Ümit Dündar, personally called Erdoğan to warn him of the plot, persuading him to evacuate his hotel ahead of the plotters, and helped to secure Istanbul for Erdoğan to land.The MİT also mobilized its anti-aircraft guns, which the plotters were unaware existed, deterring rebel jets and commando teams.\n\nEqually important to the coup\'s failure, according to military strategist Edward N. Luttwak, was the inability of the rebels to neutralize Erdoğan and other high ranking government officials, either by killing or detaining them.A unit of special forces was sent via helicopter to kill or capture the president, but missed because he had been evacuated by his security detail just minutes before.Once Erdoğan landed at Atatürk International Airport (which had been recaptured from the rebels by his supporters), It became highly unlikely that the coup attempt would succeed.According to a military source, several rebel F-16s targeted Erdoğan\'s presidential jet en route to Istanbul, but they did not fire.A senior Turkish counter-terrorism official later stated that the jets did not fire because the fighter jet pilots were told by President Erdoğan\'s pilot over the radio that the (flight of the) Gulfstream IV was a Turkish Airlines flight.\n\nAccording to Naunihal Singh, author of Seizing Power, the coup attempt also failed because the plotters failed to secure control of the media and shape the narrative.Successful coups require that the rebels control the mass media.This allows even small rebel contingents to portray themselves as fully in control, and their victory as inevitable.Consequently, they convince the public, along with neutral and even loyalist soldiers, to defect to them or not resist.The rebels failed to properly broadcast their messages effectively across the media that they controlled.They failed to capture Türksat, Turkey\'s main cable and satellite communications company, and failed to gain control of the country\'s television and mobile phone networks.This allowed Erdoğan to make his Facetime call, and to speak on television.\n\nOther scholars of civil-military relations, like Drew H. Kinney, have said reports like Luttwak and Singh\'s miss the point of their own analysis: civil resistance thwarted the coup.Luttwak argues that wayward elements of the Turkish armed forces could not silence Erdoğan.Singh says that the rebels could not project success because they couldn\'t control the message.Kinney states that neither of these reasons on their own matter, but rather it\'s their effect—civil disobedience—that is important.We might find that ""[Gülen\'s movement] ...[might] have had nothing to do with the attempted takeover in July, but civilians [nevertheless] definitely played a role in thwarting the coup,"" writes Kinney.""...[A]n unhappy civilian populace mobilized to face down the military.""\n\nErdoğan wasn\'t censored (Luttwak\'s point) and was therefore able to use FaceTime to mobilize resistance, which in turn hindered the conspirators\' ability to project success (Singh\'s point).The result is civilian resistance to soldiers, i.e., people power.The reason Singh, Luttwak, and other scholars of civil-military relations miss this is, according to Kinney, because they ""usually do not study extra-military reasons for coup failures/successes,"" but rather put a premium on ""the inner-workings of the [military] operation.""In short, they blame the military for its failure rather than acknowledge the power of the masses and their successes.\n\nPro-state forces sent text messages to every Turkish citizen calling for them to protest against the coup attempt.Throughout the night sela prayers were repeatedly called from mosque minarets across the country to encourage people to resist the coup plotters.While the sela is usually called from minarets to inform the public of a funeral, they are also traditionally performed to notify of a significant event, in this case ""to rally people"".\n\nThe coup plotters initiated their operation hours ahead of the planned time when they understood that their plans had been compromised.Had the coup been launched at its original time, the middle of the night, much of the population would have been asleep.The streets would have been mostly empty.\n\nReports have emerged, neither confirmed nor denied by Russia or Turkey that the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate intercepted signals on an imminent coup passed on to loyal Turkish operatives.The intercepted plans revealed several helicopters with commandos were on the way to Marmaris\'s coastal resort, where Erdoğan stayed, capturing or killing him.Pre-warned, Erdoğan left quickly to avoid them.\n\nAn extensive purge of the Turkish civil service began in the wake of the coup attempt, with President Erdoğan warning his opponents that ""they will pay a heavy price for this.""The New York Times along with some other Western media such as The Economist, described the purges as a ""counter-coup"", with the Times expecting the president to ""become more vengeful and obsessed with control than ever, exploiting the crisis not just to punish mutinous soldiers but to further quash whatever dissent is left in Turkey,"".As of 20 July 2016, the purge already had seen over 45,000 military officials, police officers, judges, governors and civil servants arrested or suspended, including 2,700 judges, 15,000 teachers, and every university dean in the country.\n\n163 generals and admirals were detained, around 45% of the Turkish military\'s total.\n\nOn 18 July 2016, United States State Secretary John Kerry urged Turkish authorities to halt the increasing crackdown on its citizens, indicating that the crackdown was meant to ""suppress dissent.""French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault voiced concern, warning against a ""political system which turns away from democracy"" in response to the purges.\n\nOn 17 August 2016, Turkey started releasing what was expected to eventually amount to about 38,000 prison inmates, to make more space in the penal system for detainees, numbering about 35,000, who were arrested or detained after being involved in or suspected of association, with the 2016 failed coup.\n\nOn 28 September 2016, Turkish justice minister Bekir Bozdağ said 70,000 people had been processed and 32,000 were formally arrested.\n\nMajor General Cahit Bakir, who commanded Turkish forces under NATO in Afghanistan, and Brigadier General Sener Topuc, responsible for education and aid in Afghanistan, were detained by authorities in Dubai connected with the failed coup.\n\nGeneral Akın Öztürk, former Commander of the Turkish Air Force, was the Turkish military attaché to Israel.He was arrested on charges of having played a leading role in the failed coup.Öztürk has denied the charges.\n\nGeneral Adem Huduti, the commander of the Second Army, positioned along the southern borders with Syria and Iraq, and General Erdal Öztürk, the commander of the 3rd Corps, were also arrested.\n\nRear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been stationed at NATO\'s Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk, Virginia, sought asylum in the United States after being recalled by the Turkish government.\n\nIn July 2018, Istanbul\'s 25th Criminal Court sentenced 72 former soldiers involved in the coup attempt to life in prison.\n\nOn 20 June 2019, a terrorism court in Turkey sentenced 151 people to life in prison, including General Akın Öztürk, former commander of Turkish Air Force and the most senior officer involved in the coup.128 people received ""aggravated life"" sentences, which indicates harsh conditions without parole, for their role in the coup, with another 23 receiving standard life sentences.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom President Erdoğan said as one of the principal conspirators, condemned the coup attempt and denied any role in it.""I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey,"" he said in an emailed statement reported by The New York Times.""Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force.I pray to God for Turkey, Turkish citizens, and all those currently in Turkey that this situation is resolved peacefully and quickly.As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nPresident Erdoğan asked the United States to extradite Gülen: ""I call on you again, after there was a coup attempt.Extradite this man in Pennsylvania to Turkey!If we are strategic partners or model partners, do what is necessary.""Prime Minister Yildirim has threatened war against any country that would support Gülen.Turkish Labor Minister Süleyman Soylu said that ""America is behind the coup.""\n\nRegarding the AKP\'s statement against Gülen, Secretary of State Kerry invited the Turkish government ""to present us with any legitimate evidence that withstands scrutiny,"" before they would accept an extradition request.\n\nOn 15 August 2016, former United States diplomat James Jeffrey, who was the United States ambassador to Turkey from 2008 until 2010 made the following remarks: ""The Gülen movement has some infiltration at the least in the military that I am aware of.They of course had extreme infiltration into the police and judiciary earlier.I saw that when I was in Turkey previously, particularly in the Sledgehammer case, Hakan Fidan case, and the corruption cases in 2013.Obviously, significant segment of Turkey\'s bureaucracy was infiltrated and had their allegiance to a movement.That of course is absolutely unacceptable and extremely dangerous.It likely led to the coup attempt.""\n\nOutside Turkey, in Beringen, Belgium, anti-coup protesters attempted to attack a building owned by the pro-Gülen movement group \'Vuslat\'.The police brought in a water cannon to keep the attackers at bay.In news articles it was stated that the police also protected the houses of Gülen supporters.People advocated on social media to go to Beringen once more, and there was unrest in Heusden-Zolder, elsewhere in Belgium.Furthermore, in Somalia the government ordered ""the total closure of all activities"" of an organization linked to the Gülen movement, and gave its staff seven days to leave the country.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, President Erdoğan said Western countries were ""supporting terrorism"" and the military coup, saying ""I\'m calling on the United States: what kind of strategic partners are we, that you can still host someone whose extradition I have asked for?""\n\nOn 31 January 2017, British Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, Alan Duncan said he believed the Gülen movement was responsible for the coup attempt.Duncan went on saying ""the organization which incorporated itself into the state tried to topple the democratic structure in Turkey"".\n\nIn a speech on 29 July 2016, President Erdoğan said U.S. Central Command chief Joseph Votel was ""siding with coup plotters""; Erdoğan said the United States was protecting Fethullah Gülen, whom the Turkish government blames for the coup attempt.Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim made similar comments.In response, Votel said that the Turkish government\'s statements were ""unfortunate and completely inaccurate"" and expressed concern that the mass arrests and firings of military officers would damage military cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey.Similarly, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said that the Turkish military purges were impairing the fight against ISIS.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, in an escalation of tensions with the United States, Erdoğan questioned Turkey\'s relationship with the United States and criticized the West, saying that ""script"" for the abortive putsch last month was ""written abroad"".Erdoğan stated that he had personally asked Obama to extradite Gülen to Turkey.When the U.S. government replied it would need evidence of the cleric\'s guilt before extradition, to which Erdoğan said: ""When you asked for the return of a terrorist, we did not ask for documentation. ...Let us put him on trial.""\n\nYeni Şafak daily, a Turkish pro-state newspaper, stated that the former commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, now-retired United States Army General John F. Campbell, was the ""mastermind"" behind the coup attempt in Turkey.Campbell called the statement ""absolutely ridiculous"" and President Obama said ""Any reports that we had any previous knowledge of a coup attempt, that there was any U.S. involvement in it, that we were anything other than entirely supportive of Turkish democracy are completely false, unequivocally false.""\n\nOn 1 December 2017, Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for American political analyst, former CIA official and former vice chairman of US National Intelligence Council Graham Fuller, stating his involvement in the coup.A career US State Department official who was once CIA Station Chief in Kabul and later went on to be a political scientist in Rand Corporation specializing in the Middle East, Turkish authorities said Fuller attended a meeting in Istanbul on 15 July 2016 involving organization and coordination of the botched coup.Another American among the attendance, as stated by the Turkish prosecutors, was academic Henri Barkey who was named a suspect a week after the failed coup.\n\nThe U.S. consulate in Turkey issued an advisory to U.S. citizens to avoid the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey, which houses about 50 nuclear bombs, until ""normal operations have been restored"".They stated that local authorities were denying access to the air base and that power supplying the air base was shut off.\n\nThe Incirlik base is important to the U.S.-led effort in Syria to combat ISIL and other militants.Nearly 1,500 American personnel are housed in the base.\n\nTwenty-four hours after initial reports that the air base was shut down, United States defense department officials confirmed that the base and its airspace had re-opened to military aircraft and that operations by American aircraft will resume.The Turkish commander of the air base, brig.Gen. Bekir Ercan Van was arrested.After the failure of the coup Gen Bekir Ercan Van sought asylum from the U.S., but his request was denied by U.S.\n\nFollowing the failed coup attempt multiple media outlets have published editorials advocating the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Incirlik Air base as Turkey is unstable.\n\nOn 16 July, anti-coup protesters chanted against locals in areas of Istanbul with high concentration of Alevis, including Okmeydanı and Gazi.Such incidents also occurred in a quarter of Antakya with a high Alevi population, where a motorcyclist stating to be a sharia advocate was lynched.In a neighbourhood of Ankara, shops belonging to Syrians were attacked by a mob.In Malatya, Sunni Islamists harassed residents of an Alevi neighbourhood, particularly the women, and attempted to enter the neighbourhood en masse.Police intervened and blocked all roads leading there.In Kadıköy, people drinking alcohol in public were attacked by a group of religious fundamentalists.\n\nFollowing the arrests, thousands of anti-coup protesters demanded instituting the death penalty against detainees connected with the coup, chanting ""we want the death penalty"".President Erdoğan has been open to reinstituting the death penalty, noting that ""in a democracy, whatever the people want they will get.""Turkish authorities have not executed anyone since 1984, but legally abolished capital punishment only in 2004 as a pre-condition to join the European Union.\n\nEuropean Union officials have been vocal about their opposition to purges by Turkish authorities in connection to the coup.French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that Turkey must work within the framework of the law to uphold Europe\'s democratic principles.Furthermore, on 18 July 2016, Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of Foreign Affairs of the European Union, announced that no country will be admitted into the European Union ""if it introduces the death penalty"".Moreover, German press secretary, Steffen Seibert, stated that reinstituting the death penalty will end Turkey\'s accession talks with the European Union.\n\nTurkey is a member of the Council of Europe, and ratified the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) as part of its terms of membership.The ECHR is an international treaty that includes the abolition of the death penalty among its terms.As such, Turkey is legally bound not to reintroduce the death penalty.\n\nOn 20 July 2016, President Erdoğan announced a three-month state of emergency in response to the attempted coup, invoking Article 120 of the Constitution of Turkey (""Declaration of state of emergency because of widespread acts of violence and serious deterioration of public order"").Under the state of emergency, under Article 121, ""the Council of Ministers, meeting under the chairpersonship of the President of the Republic, may issue decrees having the force of law on matters necessitated by the state of emergency"", with decrees subject to subsequent parliamentary approval.The state of emergency was endorsed by the Parliament on 21 July by 346 votes to 115.The Justice and Development Party and the Nationalist Movement Party supported the state of emergency, whilst the Republican People\'s Party and the Peoples\' Democratic Party opposed it.Prime Minister Yıldırım said at the Parliament that the state of emergency was necessary to ""get rid of this scourge rapidly"".\n\nAs part of the state of emergency, deputy prime minister Kurtulmuş announced that Turkey was temporarily suspending part of the European Convention on Human Rights following the attempted coup, invoking Article 15 of the Convention (""war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation"").The suspensions must be notified to the Council of Europe and may not affect the right to a fair trial or the prohibition on torture.\n\nThis state of emergency in Turkey as well as the hindrance of the right to protest that occurred within such framework have been layered onto a longer history of emergency rules, oppressive legislation and daily government practice that have reinforced both.We can see from this the ""autocratisation"" process in Turkey has thrived of existing legal framework deeply associated in legacies of past ""emergencies"".\n\nOn 3 October 2016 Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş declared the governments intention to extend the state of emergency by a further three months raising objections from both the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) and Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) were critical of the governments use of their emergency powers and declared that they would vote against an extension.\n\nFollowing the National Security Council\'s recommendation for the extension President Erdoğan stated that it was possible that the state of emergency could last for longer than a year prompting outcry from the opposition, Leader of the Main Opposition Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu said that ""The president saying that the state of emergency can last longer than 12 months is strengthening the fear of a counter-coup"" and that it was ""raising the prospect of opportunist measures.""\n\nThe AKP\'s governmental majority allowed the three-month extension to take effect on 19 October 2016.The two-year-long state of emergency was ended on 19 July 2018.\n\nOn 16 July 2016, the media reported that eight Turkish military personnel of various ranks had landed in Greece\'s northeastern city of Alexandroupolis on board a Black Hawk helicopter and claimed political asylum in Greece.While the Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu demanded extradition of ""the eight traitors as soon as possible"", the Greek authorities stated: ""We will follow the procedures of international law.However, we give severe considerations to the fact that [the Turkish military men] are accused, in their own country, of violating the constitutional order and trying to overthrow democracy.""The helicopter was returned to Turkey shortly thereafter.The eight asylum seekers, their asylum case pending, were later transferred to Athens, mainly for safety reasons.On 26 January, the Supreme Court of Greece eventually ruled against their extradition, on the grounds that the eight were unlikely to face a fair trial if returned to their home country and due to concerns over their safety.\n\nOn 15 February 2017, five Turkish commandos illegally entered Greece through the Evros river.However, once they entered the country, the group split.The two of them surrendered to the police and on 20 February 2017, requested political asylum.They were being held in the city of Alexandroupolis.The two men belonged to the Turkish navy.The names given by the two reportedly match the names of two fugitives wanted in relation to the shadowy operation against Erdoğan himself.The Greek government mentioned that the Greek authorities will not allow the country to be dragged into the ongoing feud between the Turkish state and the followers of Gulen.But there were no sign of the other three.According to a lawyer there were indications that the other three have been arrested by Greek authorities who were about to expel them to Turkey.According to new evidence and new information these three ""arrested"" marines were delivered under fast and informal procedures from Greek to Turkish services.\n\nAfter the coup attempt, two Turkish military attachés in Athens, Staff Col. İlhan Yaşıtlı and naval attaché Col. Halis Tunç, had reportedly disappeared along with their families.The Greek foreign ministry canceled the two attachés\' accreditations on 7 August 2016, upon the request of the Turkish foreign ministry.Greek media reported that they might have fled to Italy.On 11 August 2016, the Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu confirmed the reports saying that they had left Greece for Italy on 6 August and adding that Turkey would officially ask the Italian authorities to extradite the two soldiers.\n\nOn 9 August 2016, the media reported that Turkey\'s Rear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been on a United States-based assignment for NATO and after the coup was subject to a detention order in Turkey, had sought asylum in the United States.\n\nIn mid-November 2016, it was officially confirmed that about 40 Turkish military servicemen of various ranks stationed at NATO command structures had applied for asylum in Germany and Belgium.\n\nIn January 2017, Der Spiegel magazine and ARD broadcaster reported that about 40 mostly high-ranking Turkish soldiers who worked at NATO facilities in Germany requested asylum in Germany.\n\nAt the end of February 2017, Germany said it had received 136 asylum requests from Turks holding diplomatic passports since the July coup attempt.The figure was a total for August 2016 to January 2017; some were presumed to be military officers posted to NATO bases in Germany.\n\nIn November 2016, NATO\'s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that Turkish NATO Officers had requested asylum in the countries where they had been posted.He did not name the nations involved or the number of officers, saying it was a matter for those countries to decide.He said: ""Some Turkish officers working in NATO command structure ... have requested asylum in the countries where they are working. ...As always, this is an issue that is going to be assessed and decided by the different NATO allies as a national issue.""\n\nAs of March 2017, Norway have granted asylum for four Turkish soldiers and a military attache.\n\nSeveral Turkish citizens with diplomatic passports have sought political asylum in Switzerland.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, detainees in Turkey have been denied access to legal counsel, have been beaten and tortured.They have not been provided with adequate food, water, or medical care.At least one has attempted suicide.Amnesty International wanted the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture to send people to check on detainees conditions.A person who had been on duty at the Ankara police headquarters said that police denied medical treatment to a detainee.""Let him die.We will say he came to us dead,"" the witness quoted a police doctor as saying.\n\nAlso, Erdoğan has extended the maximum period of detention for suspects from four days to 30, a move Amnesty said increased the risk of torture or other maltreatment of detainees.\n\nTurkish Justice Ministry denied the reports and the Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said on his Twitter account: ""There has not been any torture or assault of detainees in custody,"" in response to reports by Amnesty International.""The claims of torture and assault make up a pre-packaged misinformation campaign formed by members of FETÖ, one which is untrue and distorted,""\n\nOn 7 August, between three and five million people gathered for an anti-coup rally organized by the Turkish authorities in Istanbul.President Erdoğan and the two leaders of the major opposition parties (the Republican People\'s Party and the Nationalist Movement Party) were present.\n\nGreek authorities on several Aegean islands have called for emergency measures to curtail a growing flow of refugees from Turkey; the number of migrants and refugees willing to make the journey across the Aegean has increased noticeably after the failed coup.At Athens officials voiced worries because Turkish monitors overseeing the deal in Greece had been abruptly pulled out after the failed coup without being replaced.Also, the mayor of Kos expressed concern in a letter to the Greek Prime Minister citing the growing influx of refugees and migrants after the failed coup.The Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises (SETE) warned about the prospect of another flare-up in the refugee/migrant crisis due to the Turkish political instability.\n\nVincent Cochetel, the director of the Europe Bureau of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in August 2016 that parts of the EU-Turkey deal about immigration were already de facto suspended because no Turkish police were present at Greek detention centres to oversee deportations.\n\nOn 25 August 2016, seven Turkish citizens sought asylum in Greece.Two were university professors, and their two children applied for asylum in Alexandroupoli after they illegally entered the country from the northeastern border.Also, three businessmen illegally reached the Greek island of Rhodes, and they also applied for asylum.\n\nOn 30 August 2016, a Turkish judge arrived at the Greek island of Chios on a migrant boat, with six Syrian nationals, and sought asylum in the country.He told the Greek coastguard and police officers that he is being persecuted in Turkey for his political beliefs by President Tayyip Erdoğan.The Turkish judge had been arrested for illegally entering the country and was transferred to Athens for his asylum proceedings.The Syrian nationals claimed refugee status.\n\nOn 11 September 2016, four Turkish civilians were arrested by Turkish police.An academic and a teacher attempted to escape to Greece illegally by crossing the Evros river, and the other two because they organized the escape attempt.The academic and the teacher paid a total of 12,500 euros in Istanbul to arrange their escape to Greece.Before their attempt, both the academic and the teacher were suspended from their duties as part of the ongoing probe into the failed coup attempt.Police also seized an air raft, an oar and a pump while detaining the suspects.The court later ordered the two\'s release while the other two suspects, who organized the escape attempt, were arrested.\n\nOn 21 September 2016, ten Turkish civilians, two men, two women and six children landed by boat illegally on the Greek island of Rhodes and sought asylum.They told the Greek authorities they were working in the private sector in Turkey and the Turkish government was persecuting them due to their political beliefs.\n\nOn 29 September 2016, five Turkish nationals, a couple and their child and two other men, arrived in Greece, at Alexandroupolis by crossing the Evros River by boat illegally and requested political asylum.\n\nOn 12 December 2016, one female Turkish national, landed by boat, full of refugees and immigrants, illegally on the Greek island of Lesbos.She requested political asylum.\n\nOn 24 October 2017, Turkish authorities obtained information that 995 Turks have applied for asylum in Greece after the coup attempt.\n\nMore than 1,800 Turkish citizens requested asylum in Greece in 2017.\n\nOn 18 February 2018, seventeen Turkish nationals, including six children, requested asylum in Greece at Oinousses island.\n\nIn August 2018, the former lawmaker for the Peoples\' Democratic Party, Leyla Birlik, requested asylum in Greece after illegally crossing the border near Alexandroupolis.\n\nBerlin mayor, Michael Müller (SPD), said Turkey was waging war on supporters of the Gülen movement in Germany.He said that Turkish officials had approached him and asked him whether he would be prepared to confront the Gülen movement in Berlin critically and, if necessary, to support measures against it.The mayor rejected the idea and made it very clear that Turkish conflicts could not be waged in the city.\n\nDer Spiegel presented classified documents, which showed that Turkey\'s secret service (MIT) had asked Germany\'s foreign intelligence agency (BND) for help in rounding up Gülen supporters in Germany.The Turkish secret service wanted the BND to use its influence to spur German lawmakers into taking action against Gülen supporters and extraditing them to Turkey.Also, Turkey\'s government has sent German authorities requests for searches and extraditions linked to supporters of Fethullah Gülen in Germany.\n\nIn Germany businesses thought to be in support of the Gülen movement have been harassed by Erdoğan supporters.\n\nAfter the failed coup, there was a massive demonstration in Cologne at Germany, in late July, in support of Turkish President Erdoğan.Erdoğan wanted to address the participants via video but was rejected by the local authorities and the German Constitutional Court due to security concerns.Turkey said that the ban was unacceptable and a violation of freedom of expression.\n\nGerman authorities said Turkish mosques in Germany were playing Turkish politics and worried that Turkey\'s internal politics spilled over into German cities.For years, German authorities had encouraged Turkey\'s state-run religious institution Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs usually referred to as DİTİB to provide Islamic preachers and teachers and Gülen Movement Schools for the large Turkish diaspora in Germany.DİTİB manages some 900 mosques in Germany.Gülen movement runs 100 educational facilities in Germany.\n\nAfter the failed coup DİTİB published a sermon praising ""our noble nation"" for rising against ""a wretched network"" that had sown ""seeds of sedition, rebellion and hostility.""According to Volker Beck, a member of the center-left Greens in Germany\'s Bundestag, ""That was not a religious text.It was a declaration of obedience to Mr. Erdoğan and his measures since the coup attempt,"" Volker Kauder, parliamentary group leader of the Germany\'s ruling Christian Democrats, the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU)/Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) faction, said Turkish-Germans should be loyal to Germany first and foremost.\n\nGermans of Turkish origin are being pressured in Germany by informers and officers of Turkey\'s MIT spy agency.According to reports Turkey had 6,000 informants plus MIT officers in Germany who were putting pressure on ""German Turks"".Hans-Christian Ströbele said that there was an ""unbelievable"" level of ""secret activities"" in Germany by Turkey\'s MIT agency.According to Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, not even the former communist East German Stasi secret police had managed to run such a large ""army of agents"" in the former West Germany: ""Here, it\'s not just about intelligence gathering, but increasingly about intelligence service repression.""\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nGermany\'s Office for Migration and Refugees said on 18 November 2016, it had received 4,437 political asylum requests from Turkish citizens up to October, compared to 1,767 for the whole of last year.""We must expect that the number of Turks who are seeking political asylum in Germany will continue to rise,"" said Stephan Mayer, the domestic policy speaker of the union coalition in the Bundestag.\n\nOn 10 December 2016, eleven Turkish nationals, 10 adults and one child, in a martial arts group have applied for asylum in Germany.\n\nAs of January 2018, Germany was first place and Greece second as EU destinations of choice for Turkish nationals requesting asylum after the coup attempt.\n\nTurkish police have carried out simultaneous raids in 18 cities against companies associated with United States-based Fethullah Gülen.The state-run Anadolu Agency said police searched 204 premises and detained 187 businessmen for ""membership in a terror organization"" and ""providing financial support to a terror organization"".All suspects\' assets were seized.\n\nWikiLeaks released Turkish emails and documents to respond to the Turkish government\'s purges that followed the coup attempt.In turn, the Turkish Telecommunications Communications Board blocked access to the WikiLeaks website.On 17 July 2016 Wikileaks had announced on Twitter, the leak of approximately 300,000 emails and over 500,000 documents, including those to and from AKP.\n\nWikiLeaks stated that it was attacked shortly after 17 July announcement of the planned publication and hypothesized that Turkish authorities were responsible.WikiLeaks stated in a tweet, ""our infrastructure is under sustained attack.""Tweets from WikiLeaks include ""We are unsure of the true origin of the attack.The timing suggests a Turkish state power faction or its allies.We will prevail & publish.""and: ""Turks will likely be censored to prevent them reading our pending release of 100k+ docs on politics leading up to the coup."", ""We ask that Turks are ready with censorship bypassing systems such as TorBrowser and uTorrent""; ""And that everyone else is ready to help them bypass censorship and push our links through the censorship to come.""\n\nUpon the release of the email dump, it has been reported that the emails contain little to no damning information, and instead are just mails from a public mailing list, but also linked externally to ""voter information on all of the women registered to vote in 78 out of Turkey\'s 81 provinces"".\n\nSeveral places were renamed to commemorate the failed coup: Boğaziçi Köprüsü (Bosphorus Bridge) → 15 Temmuz Şehitler Köprüsü Kızılay Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Kızılay Demokrasi Meydanı Ahmet Taner Kışlalı Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Milli İrade Meydanı (Reverted to original name a few days later) Büyük İstanbul Otogarı → İstanbul 15 Temmuz Demokrasi Otogarı In TRT, Yeni Haber Stüdyosu → 15 Temmuz Millet Stüdyosu Kazan → Kahramankazan about the province\'s local people\'s resistance to the coup plotters.Kahraman means ""hero"" in Turkish Niğde University → Niğde Ömer Halisdemir University\n\nIn 2018, the Istanbul Municipal Council decided to change the names of a total of 90 streets that included words which could be associated with FETÖ.\n\nThe Presidency of Religious Affairs stated that it would not be providing religious funeral services to the dead coupists, except for ""privates and low-ranking officers compelled by force and threats who found themselves in the midst of the conflict without full knowledge of anything"".\n\nA document dated 26 September 2016 showed that Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) asked Turkish missions and religious representatives abroad to profile Gülen movement expatriates living in their respective foreign countries.Gülen-linked schools, businesses, foundations, associations, media outlets and others were also included in the reports.Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs has gathered intelligence via imams from 38 countries.\n\nBelgium officials said they would withdraw recognition of Diyanet mosques in the country if necessary.\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nOn 21 December 2016, the Turkish government has recalled Yusuf Acar, the religious affairs attaché of the Turkish Embassy in the Netherlands, after Dutch authorities said he was spying.Acar collected information of people who sympathize with Fethullah Gülen at Netherlands and passed it on to the Turkish authorities.The Dutch government called spying activities an ""unwanted and non-acceptable interference in the lives of Dutch citizens.""and the attaché was reportedly declared persona non grata and received a ""deportation warning"" by Dutch authorities.\n\nOn 26 January 2017, President Erdoğan, during his visit to Tanzania, asked his Tanzanian counterpart John Magufuli to take action against the network of Fethullah Gülen.\n\nIn April 2017 it was announced that President Erdoğan planned to establish a purpose-built museum dedicated to the coup events, called the ""Museum of the 15 July: Martyrs and Democracy"", to be located in Kahramankazan, a town near Ankara.Paid for by Turkish Ministry of Culture funds, it is planned to open at the end of 2018.The museum opened in December 2019\n\nAmong the Turkish opposition parties, the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) issued a statement expressing their public opposition to the coup, and the Hürriyet Daily News reported that Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bahçeli telephoned Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım to express his opposition to the coup.The co-chairs of the opposition Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) issued a statement saying that the party was ""under all circumstances and as a matter of principle against all kinds of coup.""Amongst the minor parties, left-wing nationalist Patriotic Party\'s Doğu Perinçek backed democracy, when he held Gülen and the Americans responsible.Kurdish militant separatist organization Kurdistan Workers\' Party, which Turkey and its allies label as a terrorist organization, urged their supporters to stay away from the coup and rather defend their people, while the Communist Party called upon the people to overthrow the AKP government which they called an ""enemy of humanity"".\n\nDuring the first hours of the coup plotters\' moves of blocking Istanbul\'s bridges and flying fighter jets low over Istanbul and Ankara, Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjørn Jagland tweeted against the coup attempt and underlined that ""any attempt to overthrow the democratically elected leaders is unacceptable"".\n\nRussia\'s President Vladimir Putin called Erdoğan out of solidarity before all NATO member countries\' heads following the coup attempt.Erdoğan thanked the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev – who was the first president to show solidarity after the coup attempt – for his support in solving the 7-month crisis over downed Russian Sukhoi Su-24 and the Prime Minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, who was among the first NATO country leaders to condemn the coup attempt, already from the early hours of Saturday.\n\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the then prime minister of Pakistan, was all praise for the people of Turkey and the AKP government and strongly condemned what he termed as an attempt to undermine democracy in Turkey.""We deeply admire the resolve of the brave and resilient Turkish people, who stood up against the forces of darkness and anarchy to express their support and commitment to democracy,"" the PM said in a statement issued from his office.\n\nThe majority of countries either expressed their support for the government or called for restraint.On 16 July 2016, however, a proposed United Nations Security Council statement denouncing the coup was not accepted by Egypt, a non-permanent member of the Council at the time, due to textual disagreements.Egyptian diplomats said that the council is ""in no position to qualify, or label [the Turkish] government – or any other government for that matter – as democratically elected or not"".Objection by the United States and the UK – permanent members of the Security Council – led to Egypt proposing a new statement calling for all sides to ""respect the democratic and constitutional principles and the rule of law"", which was rejected, preventing the condemnation of the coup attempt by the Security Council.The leader of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky supported the coup attempt.\n\nAl-Monitor reported that ""Unlike Ankara\'s Western allies, Iran did not wait for the coup\'s failure to speak up.Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif voiced support for democracy in a Twitter message in the early hours of the unrest, writing ""Stability, and democracy in Turkey are paramount"".In a subsequent phone call after the failure of the coup attempt, President Hassan Rouhani told Erdoğan the coup attempt was ""a test to identify your domestic and foreign friends and enemies.""An Iranian official pointed out parallels between the coup attempt in Turkey and the coup against Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mussadiq in 1953: ""What we know is that this attempt was triggered by foreign hands.We have experienced the same thing in the past.Since Mr. Erdogan wants to play a more positive path in the region today, they want to overthrow him.""\n\nMustafa Akıncı, President of Northern Cyprus, welcomed the fact that ""no community in Turkey ... applauded the coup as they have done in the past.""Azerbaijan strongly condemned the attempted military coup in Turkey and considered such actions unacceptable according to a statement from Novruz Mammadov, deputy head of the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration and chief of the foreign relations department.\n\nEuropean Commissioner dealing with Turkey\'s EU membership bid, Johannes Hahn, said it appears Turkey\'s government prepared arrest lists of political opponents before the coup attempt and had been waiting for the right time to act.In this sense, EU reported that as a main criticism to put this issue in the category of terrorism become the violation of the fundamental rights and fundamental values of the citizens.Hence, it underlines a total divergence of opinions and mentality between EU and Turkey which reached a deadlock here especially after the 15th of July in 2016.\n\nOn 19 July 2016, White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said during a press briefing that President Barack Obama has held a phone conversation with President Erdoğan: ""The President used the phone call to reiterate once again the strong commitment of the United States to the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey.The President pledged any needed assistance to the Turkish government as they conduct an investigation to determine exactly what happened.""\n\nOn 20 July 2016, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""Turkey has a large armed force, professional armed forces and ...I am certain they will continue as a committed and strong NATO ally.""On a statement released on 10 August 2016, the Secretary General once more strongly condemned the attempted coup and reiterated full support for Turkey\'s democratic institutions.He also expressed support for the elected Turkish government and respect for the courage of the Turkish people for resisting the coup plotters.\n\nOn 29 July 2016, the commander of U.S. Central Command, General Joseph Votel, denied statements by Turkey\'s president Erdoğan that he has supported the coup attempt in Turkey.\n\nOn 1 August 2016, United States Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, General Joseph Dunford, visited Turkey and condemned the coup attempt.Dunford said: ""The consistent theme throughout the day was a reaffirmation of the importance of the U.S.-Turkey relationship – the need for us to cooperate.""\n\nOn July, 20, there were reports that a group of Turkish military commandos coup fugitives would try to cross from Turkey to the island of Symi, in the southeastern Aegean, at Greece.The Hellenic Coast Guard was on alert and increased the patrols in the area, especially after a group of inflatable dinghies and other vessels were seen departing from Datça, on the Turkish coast, in the direction of Symi, they monitored the movements of the Turkish vessels, which remained in Turkish waters.Furthermore, a contingent of the Hellenic Police was dispatched to Symi to conduct checks there.The Greek government had been anticipating a possible attempt by participants in the failed coup to come to Greece and took the reports seriously.Turkish F-16 fighter jets were also scrambled to check reports that missing Turkish coast guard vessels had appeared in Greek waters in the Aegean.Later on the day, the Turkish interior ministry denied reports that rebel soldiers might have ""hijacked"" a vessel to flee to Greece.The Greek armed forces remained on alert the throughout the day for potential coup fugitives.\n\nAccording to Michael Rubin, from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Erdoğan had himself to blame for the coup.Following an increasingly Islamist agenda, Erdoğan had reportedly ""dropped any pretense of governing for all Turks.""After ""fanning the flames"" at the 2013 Gezi Park protests, he transformed the predominantly Kurdish-inhabited areas of southeastern Turkey ""into a war zone reminiscent of the worst days of the 1980s.""The biggest problem, according to Rubin, might have been Erdoğan\'s foreign policy, which managed to turn the initial ""no problems with neighbors"" doctrine into a situation where the country has problems with almost every neighbor and has even alienated some of its allies and friends.Rubin previously worked as an official at the Pentagon and less than 4 months before the coup, he wrote an article in Newsweek magazine titled, ""Will There Be a Coup Against Erdogan in Turkey?""\n\nBritish Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk warned that ""too late did Erdoğan realize the cost of the role he had chosen for his country.It\'s one thing to say sorry to Putin and patch up relations with Netanyahu; but when you can no longer trust your army, there are more serious matters to concentrate upon.""Even if this coup may have failed, Fisk expected another to follow in the months or years to come.\n\nTurkish professor Akın Ünver described the coup d\'état attempt as ""more of a mutiny"".\n\nThe name of the ""Peace at Home Council"" – Yurtta Sulh Konseyi – is derived from Atatürk\'s famous saying \'Peace at Home, Peace in the World\'.Journalist Ezgi Başaran said that ""the statement of the junta, that was [...] read on the [...] government TV [channel] as the coup got under way, bore a strong resemblance to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk\'s famous address to the Turkish Youth.[...] On the other hand, given that these references are too obvious, they may have been intentionally included to insinuate a Kemalist junta rather than a Gülenist one.""\n\nThe citizen journalism site Bellingcat published an analysis of the messages of a WhatsApp group consisting of high-ranking military officials who had taken part in the coup covering their activities including them killing several people.The messages were cross referenced with video footage.The group was named ""Yurtta sulh"" which refers to a peace at home speech and they seem secular and military with no references to Gülen or anything related during the several hours of messaging.\n\nNews reports have suggested that the coup ringleader was Adil Öksüz.Some believe Öksüz to have been an operative with Turkish intelligence.\n\nGerman Islamic studies scholar said the putschists tried to forestall a large-scale purge of judiciary and military, the implementation of which had already started on Saturday, the day after the coup attempt.According to Turkish investigative journalist Ahmet Şık, a list of officials to be purged had been ready compiled by the attorney-general of Izmir, Okan Bato, and was approved by President Erdoğan.According to this version, the putschists had to quickly bring forward their coup attempt before being disposed and arrested.\n\nDuring and after the events, several politicians and commentators suggested that the government knew about the coup in advance and possibly directed it.The facts that the coup attempt began in the evening rather than at a more inconspicuous time and that the events were largely confined to Ankara and Istanbul contributed to doubts about the authenticity of the coup attempt.Journalists and opposition politicians branded it a \'tragic comedy\' and \'theatre play\'.Advocates of such theories pointed to how Erdoğan stood to gain from the coup attempt in terms of increasing his popularity and support for his calls for an executive presidency, while being able to legitimize further crackdowns on judicial independence and the opposition in general.\n\nOther elements that were reported to support the theory included: no list of demands by the coup plotters, the organization and response of the police, the long lists of arrests that seemed to be ready surprisingly quickly (including arrests of 2,745 judges and 2,839 soldiers), and the obvious nature of the coup actions.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom Erdoğan had said as being one of the principal conspirators, commented, ""I don\'t believe that the world believes the accusations made by President Erdoğan.There is a possibility that it could be a staged coup and it could be meant for further accusations [against the Gülenists].""Journalist Cengiz Çandar, a veteran observer of Turkey\'s coups, said ""I have never seen any with this magnitude of such inexplicable sloppiness.""Prominent Hizmet (Gülen movement) spokesman Alp Aslandogan said, referencing that the Turkish Air Force commander met with Erdoğan before 15 July, that certain legal documentation related to the coup seemed written beforehand, arguing that within ""the indictment written by a prosecutor on the night of 15 July to 16 July, there were events there that didn\'t actually happen.Some events did happen, but those events didn\'t happen by the time the document started.It looks like a bigger plan was there, and part of the plan did not come to pass.""\n\nThe organization and spontaneous synchronization by large numbers of mosques was perceived to be unachievable unless there had been prior preparation, with journalists also pointing to how Erdoğan could have strategically used the call to prayer to invoke religious sentiment in a political situation as a veiled attack on state secularism.\n\nThousands of arrests and purges were conducted by Turkish authorities between 16 and 18 July 2016.The sheer number of these arrests made at such a speed could only be done so if the ""Turkish government had all those lists ready"", as suggested by Johannes Hahn, European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, on 18 July 2016.Hahn also said that because these lists were already available immediately after the coup, the ""event was prepared"" and the lists were to be used ""at a certain stage"".\n\nMehmet Dişli, who was seen giving orders to the coup plotters and who was the one who put a belt around Hulusi Akar\'s neck to make him sign, is the brother of Şaban Dişli, a former vice president of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and confidant of Erdoğan.\n\nSeveral social media users have compared the coup attempt to the Reichstag fire in 1933, which Adolf Hitler used as an excuse to suspend civil liberties and order mass arrests of his opponents.Politico correspondent Ryan Heath said that ""the coup was staged to allow Erdoğan to purge the military of opponents and increase his grip on the country"".Heath used Twitter to share comments from his Turkish source, who called the events of Friday night a ""fake coup"" which would help a ""fake democracy warrior"" (referring to Erdoğan).The source said: ""Probably we\'ll see an early election [in] which he\'ll try to guarantee an unbelievable majority of the votes.And this will probably guarantee another 10–15 years of authoritarian, elected dictatorship.""\n\nThe New York Times reported that some Turkish citizens believed the coup attempt was staged by Erdoğan to improve his public image and popularity, while cracking down on political opponents and expanding his power.Critics found it suspect that reportedly no government officials were arrested or harmed during the attempted coup, which—among other factors—raised the suspicion of a false flag event staged by the Turkish government to crack down on opposition parties.Those in Turkey suggesting that the coup was staged are also being questioned by the government.\n\nPoliticians and journalists who were skeptical of the authenticity of the coup plot said that in reality, a \'civil coup\' had effectively been staged against the Armed Forces and Judiciary, both of which were extensively purged of stated Gülen supporters by the government shortly after the events.Skeptics said that the coup would be used as an excuse for further erosion of judicial independence and a crackdown on the opposition, giving the AKP greater and unstoppable power over all state institutions and paving the way for a more radical Islamist agenda at odds with the founding principles of the Turkish Republic.\n\nJustice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said in late July 2016 that Turkish social media users who said the government was staging the coup faced investigation: ""Just look at the people who are saying on social media that this was theatre.Public prosecutors are already investigating them.Most of them are losers who think it is an honor to die for Fethullah Gülen\'s command.""\n\nOn 12 July 2017, Stockholm Center for Freedom, a monitoring group with reported links to the Gülen movement, published a controversial report stating that President Erdogan orchestrated the coup bid as a false flag to consolidate his powers, set up his opposition for a mass persecution, and push Turkish Armed Forces into a military incursion into Syria.According to the report, it uncovered new evidence from 11 July 2016, four days before the planned coup bid, that a secret plan was circulated among select group of Armed Forces to give an appearance of a coup attempt.The plan was sanctioned by intelligence and military chiefs with the approval of Erdogan.\n\nIn early November 2017, Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for , former Director of the Middle East Program of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, stating that he is an agent of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), that he was present in Istanbul during the 2016 Turkish coup attempt, and that he was one of the key organizers behind the coup attempt.Around 1 December, the Istanbul prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for Graham E. Fuller, an American author and political analyst specializing in Islamic extremism after a long CIA career and holding the role of vice-chair of the United States National Intelligence Council.The prosecutor\'s office based the warrant on suspicion of Fuller helping to plan the coup attempt.Hürriyet stated that Turkish authorities believed that they had traced Fuller\'s location before the attempted coup and afterward when he left Turkey.\n\nBarkey denied his reported role in the coup, describing the claims as ""so ludicrous that they do not even deserve the term \'science fiction\'.""\n\nDeep state in Turkey The Imam\'s Army List of coups and coup attempts since 2010 List of modern conflicts in the Middle East List of attacks on legislatures\n', 'Claim_Context': 'In March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.

106,"{'Wiki_Title': '2016 Turkish coup attempt', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'On 15 July 2016, a faction within the Turkish Armed Forces, organized as the Peace at Home Council, attempted a coup d\'état against state institutions, including the government and president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.They attempted to seize control of several places in Ankara, Istanbul, Marmaris and elsewhere, such as the Asian side entrance of the Bosphorus Bridge, but failed to do so after forces and civilians loyal to the state defeated them.The Council cited an erosion of secularism, elimination of democratic rule, disregard for human rights, and Turkey\'s loss of credibility in the international arena as reasons for the coup.The government said it had evidence the coup leaders were linked to the Gülen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the Republic of Turkey and led by Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish businessman and a well-known Islamic scholar who lives in exile in Pennsylvania.The Turkish government alleged that Gülen was behind the coup (which Gülen denied) and that the United States was harboring him.Events surrounding the coup attempt and the purges in its aftermath reflect a complex power struggle between Islamist elites in Turkey.\n\nDuring the coup attempt, over 300 people were killed and more than 2,100 were injured.Many government buildings, including the Turkish Parliament and the Presidential Palace, were bombed from the air.Mass arrests followed, with at least 40,000 detained, including at least 10,000 soldiers and 2,745 judges, for being affiliated with the coup attempt.15,000 education staff were also suspended and the licenses of 21,000 teachers working at private institutions were revoked after the government stated they were loyal to Gülen.More than 77,000 people have been arrested and over 160,000 fired from their jobs, on reports of connections to Gülen.\n\nThere were many reactions against the coup attempt, both domestically and internationally.The main opposition parties in Turkey condemned the attempt, while several international leaders—such as those of the United States, NATO, the European Union, and neighboring countries—called for ""respect of the democratic institutions in Turkey and its elected officials.""Many international organizations also opposed the coup.The United Nations Security Council, however, did not denounce the coup after disagreements over the phrasing of a statement.Iran opposed the coup and advised Erdogan to defeat the coup plotters.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the head of United States Central Command, General Joseph Votel, was ""siding with coup plotters"", after Votel criticized the Turkish government for arresting the Pentagon\'s contacts in Turkey.\n\nIn March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.The same month, the British Parliament\'s Foreign Affairs Select Committee said some Gulenists were involved in the coup d\'état attempt but found no hard evidence that Fethullah Gülen masterminded the failed coup and found no evidence to justify the United Kingdom designating the Gülen movement as a ""terrorist organization"".\n\nSince the 1970s, followers of the influential cleric Fethullah Gülen had assumed increasingly important positions within the Turkish state apparatus.Gülen several times advised his followers to take key positions in society and government, if necessary with a secret identity to avoid opposition from the laicistic Turkish army and government.Nevertheless, at the start of the 21st century, Gülen\'s followers achieved crucial positions of power in Turkey (and beyond) with a vast network of newspapers, TV channels, schools, associations, lobby organizations, financial institutions and positions within the state such as the army and the judiciary.Initially, the then Prime Minister Erdogan seemingly tolerated the power of the Gülen movement because of common interests such as limiting the undemocratic political power of the military, but also because of impotence and fear of Gülen\'s power within Turkey.\n\nA series of events eventually led to a rift between Erdogan and Gülen.For example, prosecutors that allegedly were aligned with the Gülen movement tried to arrest the intelligence chief Hakan Fidan for the peace negotiations with the PKK, and by extension PM Erdogan subsequently, as the Turkish secret service is directly subordinate to the prime minister of Turkey.During this period (2010-2013), state secrets were leaked, fraud was committed with the entrance exams for government employees (KPSS), a change of power occurred at the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) and (sex)tapes of both government members and opposition members were leaked.Following these events and other incidents, the Turkish government decided to designate the Gülen movement as parallel state and FETÖ (Fethullahist Terror Organization).Alleged Gülen supporters were fired or arrested.The coup attempt that followed is therefore also described by some analysts as a last desperate attempt by Gülenists to retain power.\n\nIt is widely reported that Kemalist ideology played a huge role in motivating the 15 July 2016 coup attempt, like all previous political interventions in the history of Turkey\'s military coups.Since the establishment of multiparty democracy in Turkey in 1946, the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), together with the judiciary, have viewed themselves as guardians of Kemalist ideals and the secular Turkish nationalist state established under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk against political parties that have promoted a larger role for Islam and minorities in public life.The military and judiciary have regularly intervened in politics to block or ban popular parties representing conservative Muslim Turks, attempting to relax the restrictions on traditional religious practices, such as women\'s wearing of headscarves.The military has toppled four elected governments: by coups in 1960 and 1980, and by military decisions in 1971 and 1997.The military has also banned several major political parties.In 1998, Erdoğan, then-mayor of Istanbul, was banned for life from politics and jailed because he had read a religious poem by Ziya Gökalp several years before, at a public meeting.In 2007, the military expressed its opposition to the election of Abdullah Gül, of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), as president, by issuing an e-memorandum.Still, Gül was eventually elected when the AKP won both a referendum on the matter.Also, a snap election, and the party returned with a larger majority in the parliament.The military cited erosion of secularism as one of the reasons for the coup in the statement published on the day of the coup.\n\nAs opposed to previous political interventions by the Turkish military, Turkey\'s AKP government and pro-state media maintain that the 15 July 2016 coup attempt was not motivated by allegiance to Kemalist ideology, but rather to the vast political, economic, and religious network led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen.Between 2007 and 2012, high-profile Kemalists, including high-ranking officers of the Turkish Armed Forces, faced a series of trials and purges, under reports of involvement in a secret society codenamed ""Ergenekon.""Supported by Islamist (both pro-Gülen and pro-Erdoğan) prosecutors, security officials, and media, the purges allowed lower-rank Islamist officers to assume high-ranking military positions.They were seen as a bid by Turkey\'s civilian leaders under President Erdoğan to establish dominance over the military.In these trials in 2013 – viewed as ""sensational"" and ""one of the biggest in recent Turkish history"" – 275 people, including senior military officers, journalists, lawyers, and academics, were said to be involved in the so-called ""Ergenekon"" conspiracy, reportedly plotting a coup in 2003/04 against then–Prime Minister Erdoğan.Additionally, some military officers were said to be involved in a separate reported plot, Sledgehammer.Simultaneously, Erdoğan promoted lower-ranking officers up the chain of command, ensuring that the military chief of staff was loyal to him and thereby demoralizing the army.\n\nThe AKP\'s alliance with Gülen started to collapse during 2013 as Gülenists targeted the AKP using corruption charges.After the split, Erdoğan decided it would be advantageous to rehabilitate the army.The ""Ergenekon"" convictions were overturned in April 2016 by the Court of Cassation, which ruled that the existence of the network was unproven.\n\nIn 2013, law enforcement efforts to fight corruption, which had led to the 2013 corruption scandal in Turkey, were faulted by Erdoğan.The anti-corruption efforts were a source of tension between the Gülenists and the AKP.In political analysis in the months prior to the coup attempt, the incidence of corruption was reported to be ""rife"" in Turkey.Following the coup attempt, some coup leaders cited corruption as a reason for their actions.\n\nOn 13 July, less than two days before the coup was launched, Erdoğan signed a bill giving Turkish soldiers immunity from prosecution while taking part in domestic operations.The bill requires cases against commanders to be approved by the prime minister, while district governors may sign cases against lower-ranking soldiers.The immunity bill was seen as part of the détente between the government and the armed forces.The latter has increasingly been taking over military operations in Kurdish-inhabited areas from police and paramilitary units.\n\nOn 15 July 2016, as reported just before 23:00 EEST (UTC+3), military jets were spotted flying over Ankara, and both the Fatih Sultan Mehmet and Bosphorus bridges in Istanbul were closed.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said military action was being ""taken outside the chain of command"" and it was an ""illegal attempt"" to seize power by ""part of the military"".He further said that those involved ""will pay the highest price.""Local media also reported tanks in Istanbul\'s Atatürk Airport.It was reported that Internet users within Turkey were blocked from accessing Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.Twitter later stated that it had ""no reason to think we\'ve been fully blocked"".Some hostages were taken at military headquarters, including the Turkish Chief of the General Staff Hulusi Akar.At around 21:00, the coupists had invited Salih Zeki Çolak, the commander of the Turkish Land Forces to the military headquarters.When he arrived, he was immediately apprehended.Abidin Ünal, head of the Turkish Air Force, who had been attending a wedding in Istanbul, was abducted from there by soldiers who descended from a helicopter.The coupists then tried to force Akar to sign the coup declaration, almost strangling him using a belt in the process.He refused and was then taken to the Akıncı Air Base and other commanders at the headquarters.The military also entered the Justice and Development Party\'s offices in Istanbul and asked people to leave.\n\nEarly reports said President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was safe in Marmaris, south-west Turkey, where he had been on holiday.\n\nFrom around 23:00 to midnight, helicopters bombed the police special forces headquarters and police air force headquarters in Gölbaşı, just outside of Ankara.The attacks left 42 dead and 43 injured.Türksat headquarters in Gölbaşı was also attacked, killing two security personnel.\n\nAt around 23:50, soldiers occupied Taksim Square in central Istanbul.\n\nAt 00:02, it was reported by Reuters that soldiers were inside the buildings of the state broadcaster, the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), in Ankara.During the coup attempt, soldiers forced anchor Tijen Karaş to read out a statement saying that ""the democratic and secular rule of law has been eroded by the current government"" and that Turkey was now led by the Peace at Home Council who would ""ensure the safety of the population.""The statement read in part: ""Turkish Armed Forces have completely taken over the administration of the country to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedoms, the rule of law and general security that was damaged.[...] All international agreements are still valid.We hope that all of our good relationships with all countries will continue.""The plotters said they had ""done so to preserve democratic order, and that the rule of law must remain a priority"".The statement also ordered temporary martial law (sıkıyönetim), and said a new constitution would be prepared ""as soon as possible"".TRT was then taken off air.\n\nOther media outlets were also raided by the putschists, such as Turkish newspaper Hürriyet and private broadcaster CNN Türk.\n\nReuters reported on 15 July that an EU source described the coup as ""well orchestrated,"" and predicted that ""given the scale of the operation, it is difficult to imagine they will stop short of prevailing.""Another EU diplomat said that the Turkish ambassador in his capital was shocked and ""taking it very seriously"".\n\nThe Peace at Home Council was reportedly chaired by Muharrem Köse.\n\nAdana: Upon receiving the intelligence that thirty soldiers from the 10th Air Base Command would move to the base where the regional and provincial gendarmerie commands were located, the police prevented the soldiers from leaving the guardhouse with TOMA and armored vehicles and blocked them.Bitlis: In the Tatvan district of Bitlis, on the orders of Brigade Commander Arif Seddar Afşar, helicopters were circulated in the skies of Tatvan and fired at the city.The brigade command left the municipality\'s construction equipment in front of the barracks in case there was a tank operation in the district.Denizli: Approximately five hundred officers and non-commissioned officers who participated in the coup attempt surrendered to the gendarmerie and police forces.They were interrogated at Çardak District Gendarme Command.Kars: With the order of Kars 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, the soldiers who came with tanks and armored personnel carriers surrounded the Police Headquarters building and wanted to detain Faruk Karaduman, the chief of police.At the same hours, the invitation of Deputy Governors, 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, went to the command.Kocaeli: Turkcell\'s data center in Gebze was raided by soldiers who participated in the coup attempt.Soldiers who tried to interrupt the internet service were detained.Malatya: A rebellious soldier opened fire inside a base of the Turkish 2nd Army, damaging six vehicles.The base was besieged by police and loyal soldiers, and the shooter was captured.Marmaris: Three military helicopters carried out a bomb attack on the hotel where Erdoğan was staying.Forty rebellious soldiers of the Special Forces Command clashed with the police in the region.Mersin: Mersin Garrison and Mediterranean Region Commander Admiral Nejat Atilla Demirhan called Mersin Provincial Police Deputy Chief Yakup Usta and Gendarmerie Colonel Mustafa Bakçepınar and stated that the Turkish Armed Forces had taken over the administration.He introduced himself as the martial law garrison commander and ordered Mersin Governor Özdemir Çakacak and district governors to be taken into custody.Demirhan and Dağdelen, who made the same announcement with the police radio obtained from Mersin Police Department, were detained through the operation of the security forces.Sakarya: Sakarya Governorship was captured with armored personnel carriers, military trucks and many military jeeps from the military unit in the Kandıra district of Kocaeli.As a reinforcement, two military vehicles full of soldiers from the Sakarya central division command had to return to their barracks in the face of the resistance of the police and the harsh reaction of the people who took to the streets against the putschists.The vehicles occupying the Sakarya Governorate were seized by the citizens and the soldiers in them were neutralized and handed over to the security forces.Afterwards, citizens and security forces entered the governor\'s office and neutralized the soldiers there and suppressed the uprising in the province.Eight civilian citizens were injured as a result of the fire opened by the military during the incident.Şırnak: Çakırsöğüt Gendarmerie Commando Brigadier General Ali Osman Gürcan and 309 soldiers, that participated in the coup attempt, were detained by the security forces.\n\nTurkey\'s Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım responded to the events by stating that an ""illegal action is taking place outside of the chain of command"".He also said that ""the government elected by the people remains in charge and this government will only go when the people say so.""The Turkish Presidential office said President Erdoğan was on holiday inside Turkey and condemned the coup attempt as an attack on democracy.A presidential source also said Erdoğan and his government were still in power.The first messages from Erdoğan were transmitted at around 00:23At about 01:00, Erdoğan did a FaceTime interview with CNN Türk, in which he called upon his supporters to take to the streets in defiance of the military-imposed curfew, saying ""There is no power higher than the power of the people.Let them do what they will at the public squares and airports.""Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş appeared on live television, saying Turkey\'s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is still in charge of the government.The mayor of Ankara, Melih Gökçek of the AKP, encouraged people to go out to the city\'s streets in defiance, despite a curfew imposed by the military.Erdoğan\'s plane took off from Dalaman Airport near Marmaris at 23:47, but had to wait in the air south of Atatürk for the airport to be secured.His plane landed at 02:50\n\nThe First Army General Command in Istanbul stated in a news conference that the TSK did not support the coup and the perpetrators represented a tiny faction that were on the verge of being brought under control.Istanbul Atatürk Airport was closed; all flights from the airport were cancelled.There was an explosion in the TRT broadcasting headquarters and gunfire was reported in Ankara.Soon after, it was stormed by a crowd of civilians and police, with four soldiers inside reportedly being ""neutralized"".The channel went back on air and Karaş, who had previously announced the coup, said live that she had been held hostage and forced to read the declaration of the coup at gunpoint.\n\nBy 01:00, it was reported that the military had pulled its forces from the Atatürk airport and people were coming inside, but by 01:13, it was reported that tanks were inside the airport and gunfire was heard.\n\nTanks opened fire near the Turkish Parliament Building.The parliamentary building was also hit from the air.Injuries were reported among protesters following gunfire on Bosphorus Bridge.\n\nA helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was shot down by a Turkish military F-16 fighter jet.There were also reports of pro-state jets flying over Ankara to ""neutralize"" helicopters used by those behind the coup.\n\nAt 03:08, a military helicopter opened fire on the Turkish parliament.At 03:10, Turkish Armed Forces stated on their website that they had complete control over the country.At 03:12, Yıldırım made a statement saying that the situation was under control and that a no-fly zone was declared over Ankara and that military planes that still flew would be shot down.\n\nIt was reported that the Turkish parliament had been bombed again at 03:23 and 03:33.A helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was also seen flying by it.Half an hour following the report of 12 deaths and 2 injuries in the parliament, soldiers entered CNN Türk\'s headquarters and forced the studio to go off air.After an hour of interruption by the pro-coup soldiers, CNN Türk resumed its broadcast.Later, İsmail Kahraman said a bomb exploded at a corner of the public relations building inside the parliament, with no deaths but several injuries among police officers.\n\nAt around 04:00 two or three helicopters attacked Erdogan\'s hotel.According to eyewitness accounts, ten to fifteen heavily armed men landed and started firing.In the ensuing conflict, two policemen were killed and 8 were injured.\n\nThe Doğan News Agency reported that in Istanbul several individuals were injured after soldiers fired on a group of people attempting to cross the Bosphorus Bridge in protest of the attempted coup.\n\nOn Saturday 16 July 2016, at 00:42 EEST (UTC+3), a Turkish Black Hawk helicopter sent a distress signal and requested permission from Greek authorities for an emergency landing, and landed eight minutes later (00:50) at the Dimokritos airport in Alexandroupoli, in Greece, while two Greek F-16s observed the procedure and escorted it to the airport.The first reports said that the passengers were seven military personnel and a civilian.Later, it turned out that all were military personnel (two majors, four captains and two non-commissioned officers).They had removed the badges and insignia from their uniforms, making it impossible to know their rank.All were arrested after landing for illegal entry into the country.They were transferred to the local police station, while the Greek authorities at the airport guarded the helicopter.The eight passengers all requested political asylum in Greece as they believed they would not get a fair trial in Turkey.On 21 September 2016, Greece denied three out of the eight asylum.The men\'s lawyer Stavroula Tomara said they would be appealing the decision and said they had the ""impression that the decision has been predetermined, and that the interview was conducted just as a formality.""On 11 October 2016, four more of the eight were denied asylum.Two of the men who had previously been denied asylum applied for a re-evaluation but their applications were also rejected.\n\nAfter Erdoğan flew into Istanbul, he made a televised speech inside the airport at around 04:00, whilst thousands gathered outside.He addressed a crowd of supporters in the airport, at about 06:30 He said, ""In Turkey, armed forces are not governing the state or leading the state.They cannot.""He blamed ""those in Pennsylvania"" (a reference to Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, and his Hizmet Movement) for the coup attempt.Erdoğan also said he had plans to ""clean up"" the army, saying that ""This uprising is a gift from God to us.""State-run Anadolu Agency named former Colonel Muharrem Köse, who in March 2016 was dishonorably discharged for reported association with Gülen, as the suspected leader of the coup.However, the Alliance for Shared Values, a non-profit organization associated with Gülen, released a statement reiterating that it condemns any military intervention in domestic politics, and saying Erdoğan\'s allegations against the movement were ""highly irresponsible"".Gülen himself said in a brief statement just before midnight: ""As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nReuters reported that in early hours of 16 July, the coup appeared to have ""crumbled"" as crowds defied pro-coup military orders and gathered in major squares of Istanbul and Ankara to oppose it.Reuters also reported pro-coup soldiers surrendering to the police in Taksim Square, Istanbul.It was reported that by 05:18, Atatürk airport had completely been recaptured by the government whilst the police had surrounded the coupists inside the Turkish army headquarters, calling for them to surrender.Between 06:00–08:00 a skirmish took place there.In Akar\'s absence, Ümit Dündar, head of the First Army, was appointed Acting Chief of Staff.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning of 16 July, soldiers blocking the Bosphorus Bridge surrendered to the police.According to the government-run Anadolu Agency, this consisted of a group of 50 soldiers.Some of these soldiers were lynched by civilians despite the police\'s efforts, who fired into the air to protect the surrendering soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile, in the headquarters of the Turkish Army, 700 unarmed soldiers surrendered as the police conducted an operation into the building while 150 armed soldiers were kept inside by the police.The coupists in the TRT building in Istanbul surrendered in the early morning as well.Chief of Staff Akar, held hostage at the Akıncı Air Base in Ankara, was also rescued by pro-state forces.\n\nOne of the primary reasons that the coup failed was chaos among the plotters\' ranks.Turkey\'s National Intelligence Organization (MİT) head Hakan Fidan discovered the coup plot, and the plotters were forced to execute the coup five hours ahead of schedule.One of the main organizers, General Semih Terzi, was shot dead by loyalist Sgt.Maj.Ömer Halisdemir at the onset, demoralizing and disrupting command and control of the rebels.These two incidents resulted in the coup being carried out in an uncoordinated manner.The highest ranking staff officers opposed the coup, and publicly ordered all personnel to return to their barracks.Acting outside the military chain of command, the rebels lacked the coordination and resources to achieve their goals.The conscripted soldiers that the rebels mobilized were uninformed of their mission\'s true purpose and became demoralized.Many surrendered rather than shoot demonstrators.The commander of the First Army in Istanbul, General Ümit Dündar, personally called Erdoğan to warn him of the plot, persuading him to evacuate his hotel ahead of the plotters, and helped to secure Istanbul for Erdoğan to land.The MİT also mobilized its anti-aircraft guns, which the plotters were unaware existed, deterring rebel jets and commando teams.\n\nEqually important to the coup\'s failure, according to military strategist Edward N. Luttwak, was the inability of the rebels to neutralize Erdoğan and other high ranking government officials, either by killing or detaining them.A unit of special forces was sent via helicopter to kill or capture the president, but missed because he had been evacuated by his security detail just minutes before.Once Erdoğan landed at Atatürk International Airport (which had been recaptured from the rebels by his supporters), It became highly unlikely that the coup attempt would succeed.According to a military source, several rebel F-16s targeted Erdoğan\'s presidential jet en route to Istanbul, but they did not fire.A senior Turkish counter-terrorism official later stated that the jets did not fire because the fighter jet pilots were told by President Erdoğan\'s pilot over the radio that the (flight of the) Gulfstream IV was a Turkish Airlines flight.\n\nAccording to Naunihal Singh, author of Seizing Power, the coup attempt also failed because the plotters failed to secure control of the media and shape the narrative.Successful coups require that the rebels control the mass media.This allows even small rebel contingents to portray themselves as fully in control, and their victory as inevitable.Consequently, they convince the public, along with neutral and even loyalist soldiers, to defect to them or not resist.The rebels failed to properly broadcast their messages effectively across the media that they controlled.They failed to capture Türksat, Turkey\'s main cable and satellite communications company, and failed to gain control of the country\'s television and mobile phone networks.This allowed Erdoğan to make his Facetime call, and to speak on television.\n\nOther scholars of civil-military relations, like Drew H. Kinney, have said reports like Luttwak and Singh\'s miss the point of their own analysis: civil resistance thwarted the coup.Luttwak argues that wayward elements of the Turkish armed forces could not silence Erdoğan.Singh says that the rebels could not project success because they couldn\'t control the message.Kinney states that neither of these reasons on their own matter, but rather it\'s their effect—civil disobedience—that is important.We might find that ""[Gülen\'s movement] ...[might] have had nothing to do with the attempted takeover in July, but civilians [nevertheless] definitely played a role in thwarting the coup,"" writes Kinney.""...[A]n unhappy civilian populace mobilized to face down the military.""\n\nErdoğan wasn\'t censored (Luttwak\'s point) and was therefore able to use FaceTime to mobilize resistance, which in turn hindered the conspirators\' ability to project success (Singh\'s point).The result is civilian resistance to soldiers, i.e., people power.The reason Singh, Luttwak, and other scholars of civil-military relations miss this is, according to Kinney, because they ""usually do not study extra-military reasons for coup failures/successes,"" but rather put a premium on ""the inner-workings of the [military] operation.""In short, they blame the military for its failure rather than acknowledge the power of the masses and their successes.\n\nPro-state forces sent text messages to every Turkish citizen calling for them to protest against the coup attempt.Throughout the night sela prayers were repeatedly called from mosque minarets across the country to encourage people to resist the coup plotters.While the sela is usually called from minarets to inform the public of a funeral, they are also traditionally performed to notify of a significant event, in this case ""to rally people"".\n\nThe coup plotters initiated their operation hours ahead of the planned time when they understood that their plans had been compromised.Had the coup been launched at its original time, the middle of the night, much of the population would have been asleep.The streets would have been mostly empty.\n\nReports have emerged, neither confirmed nor denied by Russia or Turkey that the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate intercepted signals on an imminent coup passed on to loyal Turkish operatives.The intercepted plans revealed several helicopters with commandos were on the way to Marmaris\'s coastal resort, where Erdoğan stayed, capturing or killing him.Pre-warned, Erdoğan left quickly to avoid them.\n\nAn extensive purge of the Turkish civil service began in the wake of the coup attempt, with President Erdoğan warning his opponents that ""they will pay a heavy price for this.""The New York Times along with some other Western media such as The Economist, described the purges as a ""counter-coup"", with the Times expecting the president to ""become more vengeful and obsessed with control than ever, exploiting the crisis not just to punish mutinous soldiers but to further quash whatever dissent is left in Turkey,"".As of 20 July 2016, the purge already had seen over 45,000 military officials, police officers, judges, governors and civil servants arrested or suspended, including 2,700 judges, 15,000 teachers, and every university dean in the country.\n\n163 generals and admirals were detained, around 45% of the Turkish military\'s total.\n\nOn 18 July 2016, United States State Secretary John Kerry urged Turkish authorities to halt the increasing crackdown on its citizens, indicating that the crackdown was meant to ""suppress dissent.""French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault voiced concern, warning against a ""political system which turns away from democracy"" in response to the purges.\n\nOn 17 August 2016, Turkey started releasing what was expected to eventually amount to about 38,000 prison inmates, to make more space in the penal system for detainees, numbering about 35,000, who were arrested or detained after being involved in or suspected of association, with the 2016 failed coup.\n\nOn 28 September 2016, Turkish justice minister Bekir Bozdağ said 70,000 people had been processed and 32,000 were formally arrested.\n\nMajor General Cahit Bakir, who commanded Turkish forces under NATO in Afghanistan, and Brigadier General Sener Topuc, responsible for education and aid in Afghanistan, were detained by authorities in Dubai connected with the failed coup.\n\nGeneral Akın Öztürk, former Commander of the Turkish Air Force, was the Turkish military attaché to Israel.He was arrested on charges of having played a leading role in the failed coup.Öztürk has denied the charges.\n\nGeneral Adem Huduti, the commander of the Second Army, positioned along the southern borders with Syria and Iraq, and General Erdal Öztürk, the commander of the 3rd Corps, were also arrested.\n\nRear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been stationed at NATO\'s Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk, Virginia, sought asylum in the United States after being recalled by the Turkish government.\n\nIn July 2018, Istanbul\'s 25th Criminal Court sentenced 72 former soldiers involved in the coup attempt to life in prison.\n\nOn 20 June 2019, a terrorism court in Turkey sentenced 151 people to life in prison, including General Akın Öztürk, former commander of Turkish Air Force and the most senior officer involved in the coup.128 people received ""aggravated life"" sentences, which indicates harsh conditions without parole, for their role in the coup, with another 23 receiving standard life sentences.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom President Erdoğan said as one of the principal conspirators, condemned the coup attempt and denied any role in it.""I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey,"" he said in an emailed statement reported by The New York Times.""Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force.I pray to God for Turkey, Turkish citizens, and all those currently in Turkey that this situation is resolved peacefully and quickly.As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nPresident Erdoğan asked the United States to extradite Gülen: ""I call on you again, after there was a coup attempt.Extradite this man in Pennsylvania to Turkey!If we are strategic partners or model partners, do what is necessary.""Prime Minister Yildirim has threatened war against any country that would support Gülen.Turkish Labor Minister Süleyman Soylu said that ""America is behind the coup.""\n\nRegarding the AKP\'s statement against Gülen, Secretary of State Kerry invited the Turkish government ""to present us with any legitimate evidence that withstands scrutiny,"" before they would accept an extradition request.\n\nOn 15 August 2016, former United States diplomat James Jeffrey, who was the United States ambassador to Turkey from 2008 until 2010 made the following remarks: ""The Gülen movement has some infiltration at the least in the military that I am aware of.They of course had extreme infiltration into the police and judiciary earlier.I saw that when I was in Turkey previously, particularly in the Sledgehammer case, Hakan Fidan case, and the corruption cases in 2013.Obviously, significant segment of Turkey\'s bureaucracy was infiltrated and had their allegiance to a movement.That of course is absolutely unacceptable and extremely dangerous.It likely led to the coup attempt.""\n\nOutside Turkey, in Beringen, Belgium, anti-coup protesters attempted to attack a building owned by the pro-Gülen movement group \'Vuslat\'.The police brought in a water cannon to keep the attackers at bay.In news articles it was stated that the police also protected the houses of Gülen supporters.People advocated on social media to go to Beringen once more, and there was unrest in Heusden-Zolder, elsewhere in Belgium.Furthermore, in Somalia the government ordered ""the total closure of all activities"" of an organization linked to the Gülen movement, and gave its staff seven days to leave the country.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, President Erdoğan said Western countries were ""supporting terrorism"" and the military coup, saying ""I\'m calling on the United States: what kind of strategic partners are we, that you can still host someone whose extradition I have asked for?""\n\nOn 31 January 2017, British Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, Alan Duncan said he believed the Gülen movement was responsible for the coup attempt.Duncan went on saying ""the organization which incorporated itself into the state tried to topple the democratic structure in Turkey"".\n\nIn a speech on 29 July 2016, President Erdoğan said U.S. Central Command chief Joseph Votel was ""siding with coup plotters""; Erdoğan said the United States was protecting Fethullah Gülen, whom the Turkish government blames for the coup attempt.Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim made similar comments.In response, Votel said that the Turkish government\'s statements were ""unfortunate and completely inaccurate"" and expressed concern that the mass arrests and firings of military officers would damage military cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey.Similarly, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said that the Turkish military purges were impairing the fight against ISIS.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, in an escalation of tensions with the United States, Erdoğan questioned Turkey\'s relationship with the United States and criticized the West, saying that ""script"" for the abortive putsch last month was ""written abroad"".Erdoğan stated that he had personally asked Obama to extradite Gülen to Turkey.When the U.S. government replied it would need evidence of the cleric\'s guilt before extradition, to which Erdoğan said: ""When you asked for the return of a terrorist, we did not ask for documentation. ...Let us put him on trial.""\n\nYeni Şafak daily, a Turkish pro-state newspaper, stated that the former commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, now-retired United States Army General John F. Campbell, was the ""mastermind"" behind the coup attempt in Turkey.Campbell called the statement ""absolutely ridiculous"" and President Obama said ""Any reports that we had any previous knowledge of a coup attempt, that there was any U.S. involvement in it, that we were anything other than entirely supportive of Turkish democracy are completely false, unequivocally false.""\n\nOn 1 December 2017, Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for American political analyst, former CIA official and former vice chairman of US National Intelligence Council Graham Fuller, stating his involvement in the coup.A career US State Department official who was once CIA Station Chief in Kabul and later went on to be a political scientist in Rand Corporation specializing in the Middle East, Turkish authorities said Fuller attended a meeting in Istanbul on 15 July 2016 involving organization and coordination of the botched coup.Another American among the attendance, as stated by the Turkish prosecutors, was academic Henri Barkey who was named a suspect a week after the failed coup.\n\nThe U.S. consulate in Turkey issued an advisory to U.S. citizens to avoid the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey, which houses about 50 nuclear bombs, until ""normal operations have been restored"".They stated that local authorities were denying access to the air base and that power supplying the air base was shut off.\n\nThe Incirlik base is important to the U.S.-led effort in Syria to combat ISIL and other militants.Nearly 1,500 American personnel are housed in the base.\n\nTwenty-four hours after initial reports that the air base was shut down, United States defense department officials confirmed that the base and its airspace had re-opened to military aircraft and that operations by American aircraft will resume.The Turkish commander of the air base, brig.Gen. Bekir Ercan Van was arrested.After the failure of the coup Gen Bekir Ercan Van sought asylum from the U.S., but his request was denied by U.S.\n\nFollowing the failed coup attempt multiple media outlets have published editorials advocating the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Incirlik Air base as Turkey is unstable.\n\nOn 16 July, anti-coup protesters chanted against locals in areas of Istanbul with high concentration of Alevis, including Okmeydanı and Gazi.Such incidents also occurred in a quarter of Antakya with a high Alevi population, where a motorcyclist stating to be a sharia advocate was lynched.In a neighbourhood of Ankara, shops belonging to Syrians were attacked by a mob.In Malatya, Sunni Islamists harassed residents of an Alevi neighbourhood, particularly the women, and attempted to enter the neighbourhood en masse.Police intervened and blocked all roads leading there.In Kadıköy, people drinking alcohol in public were attacked by a group of religious fundamentalists.\n\nFollowing the arrests, thousands of anti-coup protesters demanded instituting the death penalty against detainees connected with the coup, chanting ""we want the death penalty"".President Erdoğan has been open to reinstituting the death penalty, noting that ""in a democracy, whatever the people want they will get.""Turkish authorities have not executed anyone since 1984, but legally abolished capital punishment only in 2004 as a pre-condition to join the European Union.\n\nEuropean Union officials have been vocal about their opposition to purges by Turkish authorities in connection to the coup.French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that Turkey must work within the framework of the law to uphold Europe\'s democratic principles.Furthermore, on 18 July 2016, Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of Foreign Affairs of the European Union, announced that no country will be admitted into the European Union ""if it introduces the death penalty"".Moreover, German press secretary, Steffen Seibert, stated that reinstituting the death penalty will end Turkey\'s accession talks with the European Union.\n\nTurkey is a member of the Council of Europe, and ratified the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) as part of its terms of membership.The ECHR is an international treaty that includes the abolition of the death penalty among its terms.As such, Turkey is legally bound not to reintroduce the death penalty.\n\nOn 20 July 2016, President Erdoğan announced a three-month state of emergency in response to the attempted coup, invoking Article 120 of the Constitution of Turkey (""Declaration of state of emergency because of widespread acts of violence and serious deterioration of public order"").Under the state of emergency, under Article 121, ""the Council of Ministers, meeting under the chairpersonship of the President of the Republic, may issue decrees having the force of law on matters necessitated by the state of emergency"", with decrees subject to subsequent parliamentary approval.The state of emergency was endorsed by the Parliament on 21 July by 346 votes to 115.The Justice and Development Party and the Nationalist Movement Party supported the state of emergency, whilst the Republican People\'s Party and the Peoples\' Democratic Party opposed it.Prime Minister Yıldırım said at the Parliament that the state of emergency was necessary to ""get rid of this scourge rapidly"".\n\nAs part of the state of emergency, deputy prime minister Kurtulmuş announced that Turkey was temporarily suspending part of the European Convention on Human Rights following the attempted coup, invoking Article 15 of the Convention (""war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation"").The suspensions must be notified to the Council of Europe and may not affect the right to a fair trial or the prohibition on torture.\n\nThis state of emergency in Turkey as well as the hindrance of the right to protest that occurred within such framework have been layered onto a longer history of emergency rules, oppressive legislation and daily government practice that have reinforced both.We can see from this the ""autocratisation"" process in Turkey has thrived of existing legal framework deeply associated in legacies of past ""emergencies"".\n\nOn 3 October 2016 Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş declared the governments intention to extend the state of emergency by a further three months raising objections from both the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) and Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) were critical of the governments use of their emergency powers and declared that they would vote against an extension.\n\nFollowing the National Security Council\'s recommendation for the extension President Erdoğan stated that it was possible that the state of emergency could last for longer than a year prompting outcry from the opposition, Leader of the Main Opposition Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu said that ""The president saying that the state of emergency can last longer than 12 months is strengthening the fear of a counter-coup"" and that it was ""raising the prospect of opportunist measures.""\n\nThe AKP\'s governmental majority allowed the three-month extension to take effect on 19 October 2016.The two-year-long state of emergency was ended on 19 July 2018.\n\nOn 16 July 2016, the media reported that eight Turkish military personnel of various ranks had landed in Greece\'s northeastern city of Alexandroupolis on board a Black Hawk helicopter and claimed political asylum in Greece.While the Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu demanded extradition of ""the eight traitors as soon as possible"", the Greek authorities stated: ""We will follow the procedures of international law.However, we give severe considerations to the fact that [the Turkish military men] are accused, in their own country, of violating the constitutional order and trying to overthrow democracy.""The helicopter was returned to Turkey shortly thereafter.The eight asylum seekers, their asylum case pending, were later transferred to Athens, mainly for safety reasons.On 26 January, the Supreme Court of Greece eventually ruled against their extradition, on the grounds that the eight were unlikely to face a fair trial if returned to their home country and due to concerns over their safety.\n\nOn 15 February 2017, five Turkish commandos illegally entered Greece through the Evros river.However, once they entered the country, the group split.The two of them surrendered to the police and on 20 February 2017, requested political asylum.They were being held in the city of Alexandroupolis.The two men belonged to the Turkish navy.The names given by the two reportedly match the names of two fugitives wanted in relation to the shadowy operation against Erdoğan himself.The Greek government mentioned that the Greek authorities will not allow the country to be dragged into the ongoing feud between the Turkish state and the followers of Gulen.But there were no sign of the other three.According to a lawyer there were indications that the other three have been arrested by Greek authorities who were about to expel them to Turkey.According to new evidence and new information these three ""arrested"" marines were delivered under fast and informal procedures from Greek to Turkish services.\n\nAfter the coup attempt, two Turkish military attachés in Athens, Staff Col. İlhan Yaşıtlı and naval attaché Col. Halis Tunç, had reportedly disappeared along with their families.The Greek foreign ministry canceled the two attachés\' accreditations on 7 August 2016, upon the request of the Turkish foreign ministry.Greek media reported that they might have fled to Italy.On 11 August 2016, the Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu confirmed the reports saying that they had left Greece for Italy on 6 August and adding that Turkey would officially ask the Italian authorities to extradite the two soldiers.\n\nOn 9 August 2016, the media reported that Turkey\'s Rear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been on a United States-based assignment for NATO and after the coup was subject to a detention order in Turkey, had sought asylum in the United States.\n\nIn mid-November 2016, it was officially confirmed that about 40 Turkish military servicemen of various ranks stationed at NATO command structures had applied for asylum in Germany and Belgium.\n\nIn January 2017, Der Spiegel magazine and ARD broadcaster reported that about 40 mostly high-ranking Turkish soldiers who worked at NATO facilities in Germany requested asylum in Germany.\n\nAt the end of February 2017, Germany said it had received 136 asylum requests from Turks holding diplomatic passports since the July coup attempt.The figure was a total for August 2016 to January 2017; some were presumed to be military officers posted to NATO bases in Germany.\n\nIn November 2016, NATO\'s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that Turkish NATO Officers had requested asylum in the countries where they had been posted.He did not name the nations involved or the number of officers, saying it was a matter for those countries to decide.He said: ""Some Turkish officers working in NATO command structure ... have requested asylum in the countries where they are working. ...As always, this is an issue that is going to be assessed and decided by the different NATO allies as a national issue.""\n\nAs of March 2017, Norway have granted asylum for four Turkish soldiers and a military attache.\n\nSeveral Turkish citizens with diplomatic passports have sought political asylum in Switzerland.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, detainees in Turkey have been denied access to legal counsel, have been beaten and tortured.They have not been provided with adequate food, water, or medical care.At least one has attempted suicide.Amnesty International wanted the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture to send people to check on detainees conditions.A person who had been on duty at the Ankara police headquarters said that police denied medical treatment to a detainee.""Let him die.We will say he came to us dead,"" the witness quoted a police doctor as saying.\n\nAlso, Erdoğan has extended the maximum period of detention for suspects from four days to 30, a move Amnesty said increased the risk of torture or other maltreatment of detainees.\n\nTurkish Justice Ministry denied the reports and the Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said on his Twitter account: ""There has not been any torture or assault of detainees in custody,"" in response to reports by Amnesty International.""The claims of torture and assault make up a pre-packaged misinformation campaign formed by members of FETÖ, one which is untrue and distorted,""\n\nOn 7 August, between three and five million people gathered for an anti-coup rally organized by the Turkish authorities in Istanbul.President Erdoğan and the two leaders of the major opposition parties (the Republican People\'s Party and the Nationalist Movement Party) were present.\n\nGreek authorities on several Aegean islands have called for emergency measures to curtail a growing flow of refugees from Turkey; the number of migrants and refugees willing to make the journey across the Aegean has increased noticeably after the failed coup.At Athens officials voiced worries because Turkish monitors overseeing the deal in Greece had been abruptly pulled out after the failed coup without being replaced.Also, the mayor of Kos expressed concern in a letter to the Greek Prime Minister citing the growing influx of refugees and migrants after the failed coup.The Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises (SETE) warned about the prospect of another flare-up in the refugee/migrant crisis due to the Turkish political instability.\n\nVincent Cochetel, the director of the Europe Bureau of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in August 2016 that parts of the EU-Turkey deal about immigration were already de facto suspended because no Turkish police were present at Greek detention centres to oversee deportations.\n\nOn 25 August 2016, seven Turkish citizens sought asylum in Greece.Two were university professors, and their two children applied for asylum in Alexandroupoli after they illegally entered the country from the northeastern border.Also, three businessmen illegally reached the Greek island of Rhodes, and they also applied for asylum.\n\nOn 30 August 2016, a Turkish judge arrived at the Greek island of Chios on a migrant boat, with six Syrian nationals, and sought asylum in the country.He told the Greek coastguard and police officers that he is being persecuted in Turkey for his political beliefs by President Tayyip Erdoğan.The Turkish judge had been arrested for illegally entering the country and was transferred to Athens for his asylum proceedings.The Syrian nationals claimed refugee status.\n\nOn 11 September 2016, four Turkish civilians were arrested by Turkish police.An academic and a teacher attempted to escape to Greece illegally by crossing the Evros river, and the other two because they organized the escape attempt.The academic and the teacher paid a total of 12,500 euros in Istanbul to arrange their escape to Greece.Before their attempt, both the academic and the teacher were suspended from their duties as part of the ongoing probe into the failed coup attempt.Police also seized an air raft, an oar and a pump while detaining the suspects.The court later ordered the two\'s release while the other two suspects, who organized the escape attempt, were arrested.\n\nOn 21 September 2016, ten Turkish civilians, two men, two women and six children landed by boat illegally on the Greek island of Rhodes and sought asylum.They told the Greek authorities they were working in the private sector in Turkey and the Turkish government was persecuting them due to their political beliefs.\n\nOn 29 September 2016, five Turkish nationals, a couple and their child and two other men, arrived in Greece, at Alexandroupolis by crossing the Evros River by boat illegally and requested political asylum.\n\nOn 12 December 2016, one female Turkish national, landed by boat, full of refugees and immigrants, illegally on the Greek island of Lesbos.She requested political asylum.\n\nOn 24 October 2017, Turkish authorities obtained information that 995 Turks have applied for asylum in Greece after the coup attempt.\n\nMore than 1,800 Turkish citizens requested asylum in Greece in 2017.\n\nOn 18 February 2018, seventeen Turkish nationals, including six children, requested asylum in Greece at Oinousses island.\n\nIn August 2018, the former lawmaker for the Peoples\' Democratic Party, Leyla Birlik, requested asylum in Greece after illegally crossing the border near Alexandroupolis.\n\nBerlin mayor, Michael Müller (SPD), said Turkey was waging war on supporters of the Gülen movement in Germany.He said that Turkish officials had approached him and asked him whether he would be prepared to confront the Gülen movement in Berlin critically and, if necessary, to support measures against it.The mayor rejected the idea and made it very clear that Turkish conflicts could not be waged in the city.\n\nDer Spiegel presented classified documents, which showed that Turkey\'s secret service (MIT) had asked Germany\'s foreign intelligence agency (BND) for help in rounding up Gülen supporters in Germany.The Turkish secret service wanted the BND to use its influence to spur German lawmakers into taking action against Gülen supporters and extraditing them to Turkey.Also, Turkey\'s government has sent German authorities requests for searches and extraditions linked to supporters of Fethullah Gülen in Germany.\n\nIn Germany businesses thought to be in support of the Gülen movement have been harassed by Erdoğan supporters.\n\nAfter the failed coup, there was a massive demonstration in Cologne at Germany, in late July, in support of Turkish President Erdoğan.Erdoğan wanted to address the participants via video but was rejected by the local authorities and the German Constitutional Court due to security concerns.Turkey said that the ban was unacceptable and a violation of freedom of expression.\n\nGerman authorities said Turkish mosques in Germany were playing Turkish politics and worried that Turkey\'s internal politics spilled over into German cities.For years, German authorities had encouraged Turkey\'s state-run religious institution Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs usually referred to as DİTİB to provide Islamic preachers and teachers and Gülen Movement Schools for the large Turkish diaspora in Germany.DİTİB manages some 900 mosques in Germany.Gülen movement runs 100 educational facilities in Germany.\n\nAfter the failed coup DİTİB published a sermon praising ""our noble nation"" for rising against ""a wretched network"" that had sown ""seeds of sedition, rebellion and hostility.""According to Volker Beck, a member of the center-left Greens in Germany\'s Bundestag, ""That was not a religious text.It was a declaration of obedience to Mr. Erdoğan and his measures since the coup attempt,"" Volker Kauder, parliamentary group leader of the Germany\'s ruling Christian Democrats, the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU)/Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) faction, said Turkish-Germans should be loyal to Germany first and foremost.\n\nGermans of Turkish origin are being pressured in Germany by informers and officers of Turkey\'s MIT spy agency.According to reports Turkey had 6,000 informants plus MIT officers in Germany who were putting pressure on ""German Turks"".Hans-Christian Ströbele said that there was an ""unbelievable"" level of ""secret activities"" in Germany by Turkey\'s MIT agency.According to Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, not even the former communist East German Stasi secret police had managed to run such a large ""army of agents"" in the former West Germany: ""Here, it\'s not just about intelligence gathering, but increasingly about intelligence service repression.""\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nGermany\'s Office for Migration and Refugees said on 18 November 2016, it had received 4,437 political asylum requests from Turkish citizens up to October, compared to 1,767 for the whole of last year.""We must expect that the number of Turks who are seeking political asylum in Germany will continue to rise,"" said Stephan Mayer, the domestic policy speaker of the union coalition in the Bundestag.\n\nOn 10 December 2016, eleven Turkish nationals, 10 adults and one child, in a martial arts group have applied for asylum in Germany.\n\nAs of January 2018, Germany was first place and Greece second as EU destinations of choice for Turkish nationals requesting asylum after the coup attempt.\n\nTurkish police have carried out simultaneous raids in 18 cities against companies associated with United States-based Fethullah Gülen.The state-run Anadolu Agency said police searched 204 premises and detained 187 businessmen for ""membership in a terror organization"" and ""providing financial support to a terror organization"".All suspects\' assets were seized.\n\nWikiLeaks released Turkish emails and documents to respond to the Turkish government\'s purges that followed the coup attempt.In turn, the Turkish Telecommunications Communications Board blocked access to the WikiLeaks website.On 17 July 2016 Wikileaks had announced on Twitter, the leak of approximately 300,000 emails and over 500,000 documents, including those to and from AKP.\n\nWikiLeaks stated that it was attacked shortly after 17 July announcement of the planned publication and hypothesized that Turkish authorities were responsible.WikiLeaks stated in a tweet, ""our infrastructure is under sustained attack.""Tweets from WikiLeaks include ""We are unsure of the true origin of the attack.The timing suggests a Turkish state power faction or its allies.We will prevail & publish.""and: ""Turks will likely be censored to prevent them reading our pending release of 100k+ docs on politics leading up to the coup."", ""We ask that Turks are ready with censorship bypassing systems such as TorBrowser and uTorrent""; ""And that everyone else is ready to help them bypass censorship and push our links through the censorship to come.""\n\nUpon the release of the email dump, it has been reported that the emails contain little to no damning information, and instead are just mails from a public mailing list, but also linked externally to ""voter information on all of the women registered to vote in 78 out of Turkey\'s 81 provinces"".\n\nSeveral places were renamed to commemorate the failed coup: Boğaziçi Köprüsü (Bosphorus Bridge) → 15 Temmuz Şehitler Köprüsü Kızılay Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Kızılay Demokrasi Meydanı Ahmet Taner Kışlalı Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Milli İrade Meydanı (Reverted to original name a few days later) Büyük İstanbul Otogarı → İstanbul 15 Temmuz Demokrasi Otogarı In TRT, Yeni Haber Stüdyosu → 15 Temmuz Millet Stüdyosu Kazan → Kahramankazan about the province\'s local people\'s resistance to the coup plotters.Kahraman means ""hero"" in Turkish Niğde University → Niğde Ömer Halisdemir University\n\nIn 2018, the Istanbul Municipal Council decided to change the names of a total of 90 streets that included words which could be associated with FETÖ.\n\nThe Presidency of Religious Affairs stated that it would not be providing religious funeral services to the dead coupists, except for ""privates and low-ranking officers compelled by force and threats who found themselves in the midst of the conflict without full knowledge of anything"".\n\nA document dated 26 September 2016 showed that Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) asked Turkish missions and religious representatives abroad to profile Gülen movement expatriates living in their respective foreign countries.Gülen-linked schools, businesses, foundations, associations, media outlets and others were also included in the reports.Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs has gathered intelligence via imams from 38 countries.\n\nBelgium officials said they would withdraw recognition of Diyanet mosques in the country if necessary.\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nOn 21 December 2016, the Turkish government has recalled Yusuf Acar, the religious affairs attaché of the Turkish Embassy in the Netherlands, after Dutch authorities said he was spying.Acar collected information of people who sympathize with Fethullah Gülen at Netherlands and passed it on to the Turkish authorities.The Dutch government called spying activities an ""unwanted and non-acceptable interference in the lives of Dutch citizens.""and the attaché was reportedly declared persona non grata and received a ""deportation warning"" by Dutch authorities.\n\nOn 26 January 2017, President Erdoğan, during his visit to Tanzania, asked his Tanzanian counterpart John Magufuli to take action against the network of Fethullah Gülen.\n\nIn April 2017 it was announced that President Erdoğan planned to establish a purpose-built museum dedicated to the coup events, called the ""Museum of the 15 July: Martyrs and Democracy"", to be located in Kahramankazan, a town near Ankara.Paid for by Turkish Ministry of Culture funds, it is planned to open at the end of 2018.The museum opened in December 2019\n\nAmong the Turkish opposition parties, the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) issued a statement expressing their public opposition to the coup, and the Hürriyet Daily News reported that Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bahçeli telephoned Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım to express his opposition to the coup.The co-chairs of the opposition Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) issued a statement saying that the party was ""under all circumstances and as a matter of principle against all kinds of coup.""Amongst the minor parties, left-wing nationalist Patriotic Party\'s Doğu Perinçek backed democracy, when he held Gülen and the Americans responsible.Kurdish militant separatist organization Kurdistan Workers\' Party, which Turkey and its allies label as a terrorist organization, urged their supporters to stay away from the coup and rather defend their people, while the Communist Party called upon the people to overthrow the AKP government which they called an ""enemy of humanity"".\n\nDuring the first hours of the coup plotters\' moves of blocking Istanbul\'s bridges and flying fighter jets low over Istanbul and Ankara, Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjørn Jagland tweeted against the coup attempt and underlined that ""any attempt to overthrow the democratically elected leaders is unacceptable"".\n\nRussia\'s President Vladimir Putin called Erdoğan out of solidarity before all NATO member countries\' heads following the coup attempt.Erdoğan thanked the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev – who was the first president to show solidarity after the coup attempt – for his support in solving the 7-month crisis over downed Russian Sukhoi Su-24 and the Prime Minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, who was among the first NATO country leaders to condemn the coup attempt, already from the early hours of Saturday.\n\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the then prime minister of Pakistan, was all praise for the people of Turkey and the AKP government and strongly condemned what he termed as an attempt to undermine democracy in Turkey.""We deeply admire the resolve of the brave and resilient Turkish people, who stood up against the forces of darkness and anarchy to express their support and commitment to democracy,"" the PM said in a statement issued from his office.\n\nThe majority of countries either expressed their support for the government or called for restraint.On 16 July 2016, however, a proposed United Nations Security Council statement denouncing the coup was not accepted by Egypt, a non-permanent member of the Council at the time, due to textual disagreements.Egyptian diplomats said that the council is ""in no position to qualify, or label [the Turkish] government – or any other government for that matter – as democratically elected or not"".Objection by the United States and the UK – permanent members of the Security Council – led to Egypt proposing a new statement calling for all sides to ""respect the democratic and constitutional principles and the rule of law"", which was rejected, preventing the condemnation of the coup attempt by the Security Council.The leader of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky supported the coup attempt.\n\nAl-Monitor reported that ""Unlike Ankara\'s Western allies, Iran did not wait for the coup\'s failure to speak up.Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif voiced support for democracy in a Twitter message in the early hours of the unrest, writing ""Stability, and democracy in Turkey are paramount"".In a subsequent phone call after the failure of the coup attempt, President Hassan Rouhani told Erdoğan the coup attempt was ""a test to identify your domestic and foreign friends and enemies.""An Iranian official pointed out parallels between the coup attempt in Turkey and the coup against Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mussadiq in 1953: ""What we know is that this attempt was triggered by foreign hands.We have experienced the same thing in the past.Since Mr. Erdogan wants to play a more positive path in the region today, they want to overthrow him.""\n\nMustafa Akıncı, President of Northern Cyprus, welcomed the fact that ""no community in Turkey ... applauded the coup as they have done in the past.""Azerbaijan strongly condemned the attempted military coup in Turkey and considered such actions unacceptable according to a statement from Novruz Mammadov, deputy head of the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration and chief of the foreign relations department.\n\nEuropean Commissioner dealing with Turkey\'s EU membership bid, Johannes Hahn, said it appears Turkey\'s government prepared arrest lists of political opponents before the coup attempt and had been waiting for the right time to act.In this sense, EU reported that as a main criticism to put this issue in the category of terrorism become the violation of the fundamental rights and fundamental values of the citizens.Hence, it underlines a total divergence of opinions and mentality between EU and Turkey which reached a deadlock here especially after the 15th of July in 2016.\n\nOn 19 July 2016, White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said during a press briefing that President Barack Obama has held a phone conversation with President Erdoğan: ""The President used the phone call to reiterate once again the strong commitment of the United States to the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey.The President pledged any needed assistance to the Turkish government as they conduct an investigation to determine exactly what happened.""\n\nOn 20 July 2016, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""Turkey has a large armed force, professional armed forces and ...I am certain they will continue as a committed and strong NATO ally.""On a statement released on 10 August 2016, the Secretary General once more strongly condemned the attempted coup and reiterated full support for Turkey\'s democratic institutions.He also expressed support for the elected Turkish government and respect for the courage of the Turkish people for resisting the coup plotters.\n\nOn 29 July 2016, the commander of U.S. Central Command, General Joseph Votel, denied statements by Turkey\'s president Erdoğan that he has supported the coup attempt in Turkey.\n\nOn 1 August 2016, United States Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, General Joseph Dunford, visited Turkey and condemned the coup attempt.Dunford said: ""The consistent theme throughout the day was a reaffirmation of the importance of the U.S.-Turkey relationship – the need for us to cooperate.""\n\nOn July, 20, there were reports that a group of Turkish military commandos coup fugitives would try to cross from Turkey to the island of Symi, in the southeastern Aegean, at Greece.The Hellenic Coast Guard was on alert and increased the patrols in the area, especially after a group of inflatable dinghies and other vessels were seen departing from Datça, on the Turkish coast, in the direction of Symi, they monitored the movements of the Turkish vessels, which remained in Turkish waters.Furthermore, a contingent of the Hellenic Police was dispatched to Symi to conduct checks there.The Greek government had been anticipating a possible attempt by participants in the failed coup to come to Greece and took the reports seriously.Turkish F-16 fighter jets were also scrambled to check reports that missing Turkish coast guard vessels had appeared in Greek waters in the Aegean.Later on the day, the Turkish interior ministry denied reports that rebel soldiers might have ""hijacked"" a vessel to flee to Greece.The Greek armed forces remained on alert the throughout the day for potential coup fugitives.\n\nAccording to Michael Rubin, from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Erdoğan had himself to blame for the coup.Following an increasingly Islamist agenda, Erdoğan had reportedly ""dropped any pretense of governing for all Turks.""After ""fanning the flames"" at the 2013 Gezi Park protests, he transformed the predominantly Kurdish-inhabited areas of southeastern Turkey ""into a war zone reminiscent of the worst days of the 1980s.""The biggest problem, according to Rubin, might have been Erdoğan\'s foreign policy, which managed to turn the initial ""no problems with neighbors"" doctrine into a situation where the country has problems with almost every neighbor and has even alienated some of its allies and friends.Rubin previously worked as an official at the Pentagon and less than 4 months before the coup, he wrote an article in Newsweek magazine titled, ""Will There Be a Coup Against Erdogan in Turkey?""\n\nBritish Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk warned that ""too late did Erdoğan realize the cost of the role he had chosen for his country.It\'s one thing to say sorry to Putin and patch up relations with Netanyahu; but when you can no longer trust your army, there are more serious matters to concentrate upon.""Even if this coup may have failed, Fisk expected another to follow in the months or years to come.\n\nTurkish professor Akın Ünver described the coup d\'état attempt as ""more of a mutiny"".\n\nThe name of the ""Peace at Home Council"" – Yurtta Sulh Konseyi – is derived from Atatürk\'s famous saying \'Peace at Home, Peace in the World\'.Journalist Ezgi Başaran said that ""the statement of the junta, that was [...] read on the [...] government TV [channel] as the coup got under way, bore a strong resemblance to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk\'s famous address to the Turkish Youth.[...] On the other hand, given that these references are too obvious, they may have been intentionally included to insinuate a Kemalist junta rather than a Gülenist one.""\n\nThe citizen journalism site Bellingcat published an analysis of the messages of a WhatsApp group consisting of high-ranking military officials who had taken part in the coup covering their activities including them killing several people.The messages were cross referenced with video footage.The group was named ""Yurtta sulh"" which refers to a peace at home speech and they seem secular and military with no references to Gülen or anything related during the several hours of messaging.\n\nNews reports have suggested that the coup ringleader was Adil Öksüz.Some believe Öksüz to have been an operative with Turkish intelligence.\n\nGerman Islamic studies scholar said the putschists tried to forestall a large-scale purge of judiciary and military, the implementation of which had already started on Saturday, the day after the coup attempt.According to Turkish investigative journalist Ahmet Şık, a list of officials to be purged had been ready compiled by the attorney-general of Izmir, Okan Bato, and was approved by President Erdoğan.According to this version, the putschists had to quickly bring forward their coup attempt before being disposed and arrested.\n\nDuring and after the events, several politicians and commentators suggested that the government knew about the coup in advance and possibly directed it.The facts that the coup attempt began in the evening rather than at a more inconspicuous time and that the events were largely confined to Ankara and Istanbul contributed to doubts about the authenticity of the coup attempt.Journalists and opposition politicians branded it a \'tragic comedy\' and \'theatre play\'.Advocates of such theories pointed to how Erdoğan stood to gain from the coup attempt in terms of increasing his popularity and support for his calls for an executive presidency, while being able to legitimize further crackdowns on judicial independence and the opposition in general.\n\nOther elements that were reported to support the theory included: no list of demands by the coup plotters, the organization and response of the police, the long lists of arrests that seemed to be ready surprisingly quickly (including arrests of 2,745 judges and 2,839 soldiers), and the obvious nature of the coup actions.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom Erdoğan had said as being one of the principal conspirators, commented, ""I don\'t believe that the world believes the accusations made by President Erdoğan.There is a possibility that it could be a staged coup and it could be meant for further accusations [against the Gülenists].""Journalist Cengiz Çandar, a veteran observer of Turkey\'s coups, said ""I have never seen any with this magnitude of such inexplicable sloppiness.""Prominent Hizmet (Gülen movement) spokesman Alp Aslandogan said, referencing that the Turkish Air Force commander met with Erdoğan before 15 July, that certain legal documentation related to the coup seemed written beforehand, arguing that within ""the indictment written by a prosecutor on the night of 15 July to 16 July, there were events there that didn\'t actually happen.Some events did happen, but those events didn\'t happen by the time the document started.It looks like a bigger plan was there, and part of the plan did not come to pass.""\n\nThe organization and spontaneous synchronization by large numbers of mosques was perceived to be unachievable unless there had been prior preparation, with journalists also pointing to how Erdoğan could have strategically used the call to prayer to invoke religious sentiment in a political situation as a veiled attack on state secularism.\n\nThousands of arrests and purges were conducted by Turkish authorities between 16 and 18 July 2016.The sheer number of these arrests made at such a speed could only be done so if the ""Turkish government had all those lists ready"", as suggested by Johannes Hahn, European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, on 18 July 2016.Hahn also said that because these lists were already available immediately after the coup, the ""event was prepared"" and the lists were to be used ""at a certain stage"".\n\nMehmet Dişli, who was seen giving orders to the coup plotters and who was the one who put a belt around Hulusi Akar\'s neck to make him sign, is the brother of Şaban Dişli, a former vice president of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and confidant of Erdoğan.\n\nSeveral social media users have compared the coup attempt to the Reichstag fire in 1933, which Adolf Hitler used as an excuse to suspend civil liberties and order mass arrests of his opponents.Politico correspondent Ryan Heath said that ""the coup was staged to allow Erdoğan to purge the military of opponents and increase his grip on the country"".Heath used Twitter to share comments from his Turkish source, who called the events of Friday night a ""fake coup"" which would help a ""fake democracy warrior"" (referring to Erdoğan).The source said: ""Probably we\'ll see an early election [in] which he\'ll try to guarantee an unbelievable majority of the votes.And this will probably guarantee another 10–15 years of authoritarian, elected dictatorship.""\n\nThe New York Times reported that some Turkish citizens believed the coup attempt was staged by Erdoğan to improve his public image and popularity, while cracking down on political opponents and expanding his power.Critics found it suspect that reportedly no government officials were arrested or harmed during the attempted coup, which—among other factors—raised the suspicion of a false flag event staged by the Turkish government to crack down on opposition parties.Those in Turkey suggesting that the coup was staged are also being questioned by the government.\n\nPoliticians and journalists who were skeptical of the authenticity of the coup plot said that in reality, a \'civil coup\' had effectively been staged against the Armed Forces and Judiciary, both of which were extensively purged of stated Gülen supporters by the government shortly after the events.Skeptics said that the coup would be used as an excuse for further erosion of judicial independence and a crackdown on the opposition, giving the AKP greater and unstoppable power over all state institutions and paving the way for a more radical Islamist agenda at odds with the founding principles of the Turkish Republic.\n\nJustice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said in late July 2016 that Turkish social media users who said the government was staging the coup faced investigation: ""Just look at the people who are saying on social media that this was theatre.Public prosecutors are already investigating them.Most of them are losers who think it is an honor to die for Fethullah Gülen\'s command.""\n\nOn 12 July 2017, Stockholm Center for Freedom, a monitoring group with reported links to the Gülen movement, published a controversial report stating that President Erdogan orchestrated the coup bid as a false flag to consolidate his powers, set up his opposition for a mass persecution, and push Turkish Armed Forces into a military incursion into Syria.According to the report, it uncovered new evidence from 11 July 2016, four days before the planned coup bid, that a secret plan was circulated among select group of Armed Forces to give an appearance of a coup attempt.The plan was sanctioned by intelligence and military chiefs with the approval of Erdogan.\n\nIn early November 2017, Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for , former Director of the Middle East Program of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, stating that he is an agent of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), that he was present in Istanbul during the 2016 Turkish coup attempt, and that he was one of the key organizers behind the coup attempt.Around 1 December, the Istanbul prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for Graham E. Fuller, an American author and political analyst specializing in Islamic extremism after a long CIA career and holding the role of vice-chair of the United States National Intelligence Council.The prosecutor\'s office based the warrant on suspicion of Fuller helping to plan the coup attempt.Hürriyet stated that Turkish authorities believed that they had traced Fuller\'s location before the attempted coup and afterward when he left Turkey.\n\nBarkey denied his reported role in the coup, describing the claims as ""so ludicrous that they do not even deserve the term \'science fiction\'.""\n\nDeep state in Turkey The Imam\'s Army List of coups and coup attempts since 2010 List of modern conflicts in the Middle East List of attacks on legislatures\n', 'Claim_Context': 'In March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.

107,"{'Wiki_Title': '2016 Turkish coup attempt', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'On 15 July 2016, a faction within the Turkish Armed Forces, organized as the Peace at Home Council, attempted a coup d\'état against state institutions, including the government and president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.They attempted to seize control of several places in Ankara, Istanbul, Marmaris and elsewhere, such as the Asian side entrance of the Bosphorus Bridge, but failed to do so after forces and civilians loyal to the state defeated them.The Council cited an erosion of secularism, elimination of democratic rule, disregard for human rights, and Turkey\'s loss of credibility in the international arena as reasons for the coup.The government said it had evidence the coup leaders were linked to the Gülen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the Republic of Turkey and led by Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish businessman and a well-known Islamic scholar who lives in exile in Pennsylvania.The Turkish government alleged that Gülen was behind the coup (which Gülen denied) and that the United States was harboring him.Events surrounding the coup attempt and the purges in its aftermath reflect a complex power struggle between Islamist elites in Turkey.\n\nDuring the coup attempt, over 300 people were killed and more than 2,100 were injured.Many government buildings, including the Turkish Parliament and the Presidential Palace, were bombed from the air.Mass arrests followed, with at least 40,000 detained, including at least 10,000 soldiers and 2,745 judges, for being affiliated with the coup attempt.15,000 education staff were also suspended and the licenses of 21,000 teachers working at private institutions were revoked after the government stated they were loyal to Gülen.More than 77,000 people have been arrested and over 160,000 fired from their jobs, on reports of connections to Gülen.\n\nThere were many reactions against the coup attempt, both domestically and internationally.The main opposition parties in Turkey condemned the attempt, while several international leaders—such as those of the United States, NATO, the European Union, and neighboring countries—called for ""respect of the democratic institutions in Turkey and its elected officials.""Many international organizations also opposed the coup.The United Nations Security Council, however, did not denounce the coup after disagreements over the phrasing of a statement.Iran opposed the coup and advised Erdogan to defeat the coup plotters.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the head of United States Central Command, General Joseph Votel, was ""siding with coup plotters"", after Votel criticized the Turkish government for arresting the Pentagon\'s contacts in Turkey.\n\nIn March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.The same month, the British Parliament\'s Foreign Affairs Select Committee said some Gulenists were involved in the coup d\'état attempt but found no hard evidence that Fethullah Gülen masterminded the failed coup and found no evidence to justify the United Kingdom designating the Gülen movement as a ""terrorist organization"".\n\nSince the 1970s, followers of the influential cleric Fethullah Gülen had assumed increasingly important positions within the Turkish state apparatus.Gülen several times advised his followers to take key positions in society and government, if necessary with a secret identity to avoid opposition from the laicistic Turkish army and government.Nevertheless, at the start of the 21st century, Gülen\'s followers achieved crucial positions of power in Turkey (and beyond) with a vast network of newspapers, TV channels, schools, associations, lobby organizations, financial institutions and positions within the state such as the army and the judiciary.Initially, the then Prime Minister Erdogan seemingly tolerated the power of the Gülen movement because of common interests such as limiting the undemocratic political power of the military, but also because of impotence and fear of Gülen\'s power within Turkey.\n\nA series of events eventually led to a rift between Erdogan and Gülen.For example, prosecutors that allegedly were aligned with the Gülen movement tried to arrest the intelligence chief Hakan Fidan for the peace negotiations with the PKK, and by extension PM Erdogan subsequently, as the Turkish secret service is directly subordinate to the prime minister of Turkey.During this period (2010-2013), state secrets were leaked, fraud was committed with the entrance exams for government employees (KPSS), a change of power occurred at the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) and (sex)tapes of both government members and opposition members were leaked.Following these events and other incidents, the Turkish government decided to designate the Gülen movement as parallel state and FETÖ (Fethullahist Terror Organization).Alleged Gülen supporters were fired or arrested.The coup attempt that followed is therefore also described by some analysts as a last desperate attempt by Gülenists to retain power.\n\nIt is widely reported that Kemalist ideology played a huge role in motivating the 15 July 2016 coup attempt, like all previous political interventions in the history of Turkey\'s military coups.Since the establishment of multiparty democracy in Turkey in 1946, the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), together with the judiciary, have viewed themselves as guardians of Kemalist ideals and the secular Turkish nationalist state established under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk against political parties that have promoted a larger role for Islam and minorities in public life.The military and judiciary have regularly intervened in politics to block or ban popular parties representing conservative Muslim Turks, attempting to relax the restrictions on traditional religious practices, such as women\'s wearing of headscarves.The military has toppled four elected governments: by coups in 1960 and 1980, and by military decisions in 1971 and 1997.The military has also banned several major political parties.In 1998, Erdoğan, then-mayor of Istanbul, was banned for life from politics and jailed because he had read a religious poem by Ziya Gökalp several years before, at a public meeting.In 2007, the military expressed its opposition to the election of Abdullah Gül, of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), as president, by issuing an e-memorandum.Still, Gül was eventually elected when the AKP won both a referendum on the matter.Also, a snap election, and the party returned with a larger majority in the parliament.The military cited erosion of secularism as one of the reasons for the coup in the statement published on the day of the coup.\n\nAs opposed to previous political interventions by the Turkish military, Turkey\'s AKP government and pro-state media maintain that the 15 July 2016 coup attempt was not motivated by allegiance to Kemalist ideology, but rather to the vast political, economic, and religious network led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen.Between 2007 and 2012, high-profile Kemalists, including high-ranking officers of the Turkish Armed Forces, faced a series of trials and purges, under reports of involvement in a secret society codenamed ""Ergenekon.""Supported by Islamist (both pro-Gülen and pro-Erdoğan) prosecutors, security officials, and media, the purges allowed lower-rank Islamist officers to assume high-ranking military positions.They were seen as a bid by Turkey\'s civilian leaders under President Erdoğan to establish dominance over the military.In these trials in 2013 – viewed as ""sensational"" and ""one of the biggest in recent Turkish history"" – 275 people, including senior military officers, journalists, lawyers, and academics, were said to be involved in the so-called ""Ergenekon"" conspiracy, reportedly plotting a coup in 2003/04 against then–Prime Minister Erdoğan.Additionally, some military officers were said to be involved in a separate reported plot, Sledgehammer.Simultaneously, Erdoğan promoted lower-ranking officers up the chain of command, ensuring that the military chief of staff was loyal to him and thereby demoralizing the army.\n\nThe AKP\'s alliance with Gülen started to collapse during 2013 as Gülenists targeted the AKP using corruption charges.After the split, Erdoğan decided it would be advantageous to rehabilitate the army.The ""Ergenekon"" convictions were overturned in April 2016 by the Court of Cassation, which ruled that the existence of the network was unproven.\n\nIn 2013, law enforcement efforts to fight corruption, which had led to the 2013 corruption scandal in Turkey, were faulted by Erdoğan.The anti-corruption efforts were a source of tension between the Gülenists and the AKP.In political analysis in the months prior to the coup attempt, the incidence of corruption was reported to be ""rife"" in Turkey.Following the coup attempt, some coup leaders cited corruption as a reason for their actions.\n\nOn 13 July, less than two days before the coup was launched, Erdoğan signed a bill giving Turkish soldiers immunity from prosecution while taking part in domestic operations.The bill requires cases against commanders to be approved by the prime minister, while district governors may sign cases against lower-ranking soldiers.The immunity bill was seen as part of the détente between the government and the armed forces.The latter has increasingly been taking over military operations in Kurdish-inhabited areas from police and paramilitary units.\n\nOn 15 July 2016, as reported just before 23:00 EEST (UTC+3), military jets were spotted flying over Ankara, and both the Fatih Sultan Mehmet and Bosphorus bridges in Istanbul were closed.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said military action was being ""taken outside the chain of command"" and it was an ""illegal attempt"" to seize power by ""part of the military"".He further said that those involved ""will pay the highest price.""Local media also reported tanks in Istanbul\'s Atatürk Airport.It was reported that Internet users within Turkey were blocked from accessing Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.Twitter later stated that it had ""no reason to think we\'ve been fully blocked"".Some hostages were taken at military headquarters, including the Turkish Chief of the General Staff Hulusi Akar.At around 21:00, the coupists had invited Salih Zeki Çolak, the commander of the Turkish Land Forces to the military headquarters.When he arrived, he was immediately apprehended.Abidin Ünal, head of the Turkish Air Force, who had been attending a wedding in Istanbul, was abducted from there by soldiers who descended from a helicopter.The coupists then tried to force Akar to sign the coup declaration, almost strangling him using a belt in the process.He refused and was then taken to the Akıncı Air Base and other commanders at the headquarters.The military also entered the Justice and Development Party\'s offices in Istanbul and asked people to leave.\n\nEarly reports said President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was safe in Marmaris, south-west Turkey, where he had been on holiday.\n\nFrom around 23:00 to midnight, helicopters bombed the police special forces headquarters and police air force headquarters in Gölbaşı, just outside of Ankara.The attacks left 42 dead and 43 injured.Türksat headquarters in Gölbaşı was also attacked, killing two security personnel.\n\nAt around 23:50, soldiers occupied Taksim Square in central Istanbul.\n\nAt 00:02, it was reported by Reuters that soldiers were inside the buildings of the state broadcaster, the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), in Ankara.During the coup attempt, soldiers forced anchor Tijen Karaş to read out a statement saying that ""the democratic and secular rule of law has been eroded by the current government"" and that Turkey was now led by the Peace at Home Council who would ""ensure the safety of the population.""The statement read in part: ""Turkish Armed Forces have completely taken over the administration of the country to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedoms, the rule of law and general security that was damaged.[...] All international agreements are still valid.We hope that all of our good relationships with all countries will continue.""The plotters said they had ""done so to preserve democratic order, and that the rule of law must remain a priority"".The statement also ordered temporary martial law (sıkıyönetim), and said a new constitution would be prepared ""as soon as possible"".TRT was then taken off air.\n\nOther media outlets were also raided by the putschists, such as Turkish newspaper Hürriyet and private broadcaster CNN Türk.\n\nReuters reported on 15 July that an EU source described the coup as ""well orchestrated,"" and predicted that ""given the scale of the operation, it is difficult to imagine they will stop short of prevailing.""Another EU diplomat said that the Turkish ambassador in his capital was shocked and ""taking it very seriously"".\n\nThe Peace at Home Council was reportedly chaired by Muharrem Köse.\n\nAdana: Upon receiving the intelligence that thirty soldiers from the 10th Air Base Command would move to the base where the regional and provincial gendarmerie commands were located, the police prevented the soldiers from leaving the guardhouse with TOMA and armored vehicles and blocked them.Bitlis: In the Tatvan district of Bitlis, on the orders of Brigade Commander Arif Seddar Afşar, helicopters were circulated in the skies of Tatvan and fired at the city.The brigade command left the municipality\'s construction equipment in front of the barracks in case there was a tank operation in the district.Denizli: Approximately five hundred officers and non-commissioned officers who participated in the coup attempt surrendered to the gendarmerie and police forces.They were interrogated at Çardak District Gendarme Command.Kars: With the order of Kars 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, the soldiers who came with tanks and armored personnel carriers surrounded the Police Headquarters building and wanted to detain Faruk Karaduman, the chief of police.At the same hours, the invitation of Deputy Governors, 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, went to the command.Kocaeli: Turkcell\'s data center in Gebze was raided by soldiers who participated in the coup attempt.Soldiers who tried to interrupt the internet service were detained.Malatya: A rebellious soldier opened fire inside a base of the Turkish 2nd Army, damaging six vehicles.The base was besieged by police and loyal soldiers, and the shooter was captured.Marmaris: Three military helicopters carried out a bomb attack on the hotel where Erdoğan was staying.Forty rebellious soldiers of the Special Forces Command clashed with the police in the region.Mersin: Mersin Garrison and Mediterranean Region Commander Admiral Nejat Atilla Demirhan called Mersin Provincial Police Deputy Chief Yakup Usta and Gendarmerie Colonel Mustafa Bakçepınar and stated that the Turkish Armed Forces had taken over the administration.He introduced himself as the martial law garrison commander and ordered Mersin Governor Özdemir Çakacak and district governors to be taken into custody.Demirhan and Dağdelen, who made the same announcement with the police radio obtained from Mersin Police Department, were detained through the operation of the security forces.Sakarya: Sakarya Governorship was captured with armored personnel carriers, military trucks and many military jeeps from the military unit in the Kandıra district of Kocaeli.As a reinforcement, two military vehicles full of soldiers from the Sakarya central division command had to return to their barracks in the face of the resistance of the police and the harsh reaction of the people who took to the streets against the putschists.The vehicles occupying the Sakarya Governorate were seized by the citizens and the soldiers in them were neutralized and handed over to the security forces.Afterwards, citizens and security forces entered the governor\'s office and neutralized the soldiers there and suppressed the uprising in the province.Eight civilian citizens were injured as a result of the fire opened by the military during the incident.Şırnak: Çakırsöğüt Gendarmerie Commando Brigadier General Ali Osman Gürcan and 309 soldiers, that participated in the coup attempt, were detained by the security forces.\n\nTurkey\'s Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım responded to the events by stating that an ""illegal action is taking place outside of the chain of command"".He also said that ""the government elected by the people remains in charge and this government will only go when the people say so.""The Turkish Presidential office said President Erdoğan was on holiday inside Turkey and condemned the coup attempt as an attack on democracy.A presidential source also said Erdoğan and his government were still in power.The first messages from Erdoğan were transmitted at around 00:23At about 01:00, Erdoğan did a FaceTime interview with CNN Türk, in which he called upon his supporters to take to the streets in defiance of the military-imposed curfew, saying ""There is no power higher than the power of the people.Let them do what they will at the public squares and airports.""Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş appeared on live television, saying Turkey\'s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is still in charge of the government.The mayor of Ankara, Melih Gökçek of the AKP, encouraged people to go out to the city\'s streets in defiance, despite a curfew imposed by the military.Erdoğan\'s plane took off from Dalaman Airport near Marmaris at 23:47, but had to wait in the air south of Atatürk for the airport to be secured.His plane landed at 02:50\n\nThe First Army General Command in Istanbul stated in a news conference that the TSK did not support the coup and the perpetrators represented a tiny faction that were on the verge of being brought under control.Istanbul Atatürk Airport was closed; all flights from the airport were cancelled.There was an explosion in the TRT broadcasting headquarters and gunfire was reported in Ankara.Soon after, it was stormed by a crowd of civilians and police, with four soldiers inside reportedly being ""neutralized"".The channel went back on air and Karaş, who had previously announced the coup, said live that she had been held hostage and forced to read the declaration of the coup at gunpoint.\n\nBy 01:00, it was reported that the military had pulled its forces from the Atatürk airport and people were coming inside, but by 01:13, it was reported that tanks were inside the airport and gunfire was heard.\n\nTanks opened fire near the Turkish Parliament Building.The parliamentary building was also hit from the air.Injuries were reported among protesters following gunfire on Bosphorus Bridge.\n\nA helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was shot down by a Turkish military F-16 fighter jet.There were also reports of pro-state jets flying over Ankara to ""neutralize"" helicopters used by those behind the coup.\n\nAt 03:08, a military helicopter opened fire on the Turkish parliament.At 03:10, Turkish Armed Forces stated on their website that they had complete control over the country.At 03:12, Yıldırım made a statement saying that the situation was under control and that a no-fly zone was declared over Ankara and that military planes that still flew would be shot down.\n\nIt was reported that the Turkish parliament had been bombed again at 03:23 and 03:33.A helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was also seen flying by it.Half an hour following the report of 12 deaths and 2 injuries in the parliament, soldiers entered CNN Türk\'s headquarters and forced the studio to go off air.After an hour of interruption by the pro-coup soldiers, CNN Türk resumed its broadcast.Later, İsmail Kahraman said a bomb exploded at a corner of the public relations building inside the parliament, with no deaths but several injuries among police officers.\n\nAt around 04:00 two or three helicopters attacked Erdogan\'s hotel.According to eyewitness accounts, ten to fifteen heavily armed men landed and started firing.In the ensuing conflict, two policemen were killed and 8 were injured.\n\nThe Doğan News Agency reported that in Istanbul several individuals were injured after soldiers fired on a group of people attempting to cross the Bosphorus Bridge in protest of the attempted coup.\n\nOn Saturday 16 July 2016, at 00:42 EEST (UTC+3), a Turkish Black Hawk helicopter sent a distress signal and requested permission from Greek authorities for an emergency landing, and landed eight minutes later (00:50) at the Dimokritos airport in Alexandroupoli, in Greece, while two Greek F-16s observed the procedure and escorted it to the airport.The first reports said that the passengers were seven military personnel and a civilian.Later, it turned out that all were military personnel (two majors, four captains and two non-commissioned officers).They had removed the badges and insignia from their uniforms, making it impossible to know their rank.All were arrested after landing for illegal entry into the country.They were transferred to the local police station, while the Greek authorities at the airport guarded the helicopter.The eight passengers all requested political asylum in Greece as they believed they would not get a fair trial in Turkey.On 21 September 2016, Greece denied three out of the eight asylum.The men\'s lawyer Stavroula Tomara said they would be appealing the decision and said they had the ""impression that the decision has been predetermined, and that the interview was conducted just as a formality.""On 11 October 2016, four more of the eight were denied asylum.Two of the men who had previously been denied asylum applied for a re-evaluation but their applications were also rejected.\n\nAfter Erdoğan flew into Istanbul, he made a televised speech inside the airport at around 04:00, whilst thousands gathered outside.He addressed a crowd of supporters in the airport, at about 06:30 He said, ""In Turkey, armed forces are not governing the state or leading the state.They cannot.""He blamed ""those in Pennsylvania"" (a reference to Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, and his Hizmet Movement) for the coup attempt.Erdoğan also said he had plans to ""clean up"" the army, saying that ""This uprising is a gift from God to us.""State-run Anadolu Agency named former Colonel Muharrem Köse, who in March 2016 was dishonorably discharged for reported association with Gülen, as the suspected leader of the coup.However, the Alliance for Shared Values, a non-profit organization associated with Gülen, released a statement reiterating that it condemns any military intervention in domestic politics, and saying Erdoğan\'s allegations against the movement were ""highly irresponsible"".Gülen himself said in a brief statement just before midnight: ""As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nReuters reported that in early hours of 16 July, the coup appeared to have ""crumbled"" as crowds defied pro-coup military orders and gathered in major squares of Istanbul and Ankara to oppose it.Reuters also reported pro-coup soldiers surrendering to the police in Taksim Square, Istanbul.It was reported that by 05:18, Atatürk airport had completely been recaptured by the government whilst the police had surrounded the coupists inside the Turkish army headquarters, calling for them to surrender.Between 06:00–08:00 a skirmish took place there.In Akar\'s absence, Ümit Dündar, head of the First Army, was appointed Acting Chief of Staff.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning of 16 July, soldiers blocking the Bosphorus Bridge surrendered to the police.According to the government-run Anadolu Agency, this consisted of a group of 50 soldiers.Some of these soldiers were lynched by civilians despite the police\'s efforts, who fired into the air to protect the surrendering soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile, in the headquarters of the Turkish Army, 700 unarmed soldiers surrendered as the police conducted an operation into the building while 150 armed soldiers were kept inside by the police.The coupists in the TRT building in Istanbul surrendered in the early morning as well.Chief of Staff Akar, held hostage at the Akıncı Air Base in Ankara, was also rescued by pro-state forces.\n\nOne of the primary reasons that the coup failed was chaos among the plotters\' ranks.Turkey\'s National Intelligence Organization (MİT) head Hakan Fidan discovered the coup plot, and the plotters were forced to execute the coup five hours ahead of schedule.One of the main organizers, General Semih Terzi, was shot dead by loyalist Sgt.Maj.Ömer Halisdemir at the onset, demoralizing and disrupting command and control of the rebels.These two incidents resulted in the coup being carried out in an uncoordinated manner.The highest ranking staff officers opposed the coup, and publicly ordered all personnel to return to their barracks.Acting outside the military chain of command, the rebels lacked the coordination and resources to achieve their goals.The conscripted soldiers that the rebels mobilized were uninformed of their mission\'s true purpose and became demoralized.Many surrendered rather than shoot demonstrators.The commander of the First Army in Istanbul, General Ümit Dündar, personally called Erdoğan to warn him of the plot, persuading him to evacuate his hotel ahead of the plotters, and helped to secure Istanbul for Erdoğan to land.The MİT also mobilized its anti-aircraft guns, which the plotters were unaware existed, deterring rebel jets and commando teams.\n\nEqually important to the coup\'s failure, according to military strategist Edward N. Luttwak, was the inability of the rebels to neutralize Erdoğan and other high ranking government officials, either by killing or detaining them.A unit of special forces was sent via helicopter to kill or capture the president, but missed because he had been evacuated by his security detail just minutes before.Once Erdoğan landed at Atatürk International Airport (which had been recaptured from the rebels by his supporters), It became highly unlikely that the coup attempt would succeed.According to a military source, several rebel F-16s targeted Erdoğan\'s presidential jet en route to Istanbul, but they did not fire.A senior Turkish counter-terrorism official later stated that the jets did not fire because the fighter jet pilots were told by President Erdoğan\'s pilot over the radio that the (flight of the) Gulfstream IV was a Turkish Airlines flight.\n\nAccording to Naunihal Singh, author of Seizing Power, the coup attempt also failed because the plotters failed to secure control of the media and shape the narrative.Successful coups require that the rebels control the mass media.This allows even small rebel contingents to portray themselves as fully in control, and their victory as inevitable.Consequently, they convince the public, along with neutral and even loyalist soldiers, to defect to them or not resist.The rebels failed to properly broadcast their messages effectively across the media that they controlled.They failed to capture Türksat, Turkey\'s main cable and satellite communications company, and failed to gain control of the country\'s television and mobile phone networks.This allowed Erdoğan to make his Facetime call, and to speak on television.\n\nOther scholars of civil-military relations, like Drew H. Kinney, have said reports like Luttwak and Singh\'s miss the point of their own analysis: civil resistance thwarted the coup.Luttwak argues that wayward elements of the Turkish armed forces could not silence Erdoğan.Singh says that the rebels could not project success because they couldn\'t control the message.Kinney states that neither of these reasons on their own matter, but rather it\'s their effect—civil disobedience—that is important.We might find that ""[Gülen\'s movement] ...[might] have had nothing to do with the attempted takeover in July, but civilians [nevertheless] definitely played a role in thwarting the coup,"" writes Kinney.""...[A]n unhappy civilian populace mobilized to face down the military.""\n\nErdoğan wasn\'t censored (Luttwak\'s point) and was therefore able to use FaceTime to mobilize resistance, which in turn hindered the conspirators\' ability to project success (Singh\'s point).The result is civilian resistance to soldiers, i.e., people power.The reason Singh, Luttwak, and other scholars of civil-military relations miss this is, according to Kinney, because they ""usually do not study extra-military reasons for coup failures/successes,"" but rather put a premium on ""the inner-workings of the [military] operation.""In short, they blame the military for its failure rather than acknowledge the power of the masses and their successes.\n\nPro-state forces sent text messages to every Turkish citizen calling for them to protest against the coup attempt.Throughout the night sela prayers were repeatedly called from mosque minarets across the country to encourage people to resist the coup plotters.While the sela is usually called from minarets to inform the public of a funeral, they are also traditionally performed to notify of a significant event, in this case ""to rally people"".\n\nThe coup plotters initiated their operation hours ahead of the planned time when they understood that their plans had been compromised.Had the coup been launched at its original time, the middle of the night, much of the population would have been asleep.The streets would have been mostly empty.\n\nReports have emerged, neither confirmed nor denied by Russia or Turkey that the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate intercepted signals on an imminent coup passed on to loyal Turkish operatives.The intercepted plans revealed several helicopters with commandos were on the way to Marmaris\'s coastal resort, where Erdoğan stayed, capturing or killing him.Pre-warned, Erdoğan left quickly to avoid them.\n\nAn extensive purge of the Turkish civil service began in the wake of the coup attempt, with President Erdoğan warning his opponents that ""they will pay a heavy price for this.""The New York Times along with some other Western media such as The Economist, described the purges as a ""counter-coup"", with the Times expecting the president to ""become more vengeful and obsessed with control than ever, exploiting the crisis not just to punish mutinous soldiers but to further quash whatever dissent is left in Turkey,"".As of 20 July 2016, the purge already had seen over 45,000 military officials, police officers, judges, governors and civil servants arrested or suspended, including 2,700 judges, 15,000 teachers, and every university dean in the country.\n\n163 generals and admirals were detained, around 45% of the Turkish military\'s total.\n\nOn 18 July 2016, United States State Secretary John Kerry urged Turkish authorities to halt the increasing crackdown on its citizens, indicating that the crackdown was meant to ""suppress dissent.""French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault voiced concern, warning against a ""political system which turns away from democracy"" in response to the purges.\n\nOn 17 August 2016, Turkey started releasing what was expected to eventually amount to about 38,000 prison inmates, to make more space in the penal system for detainees, numbering about 35,000, who were arrested or detained after being involved in or suspected of association, with the 2016 failed coup.\n\nOn 28 September 2016, Turkish justice minister Bekir Bozdağ said 70,000 people had been processed and 32,000 were formally arrested.\n\nMajor General Cahit Bakir, who commanded Turkish forces under NATO in Afghanistan, and Brigadier General Sener Topuc, responsible for education and aid in Afghanistan, were detained by authorities in Dubai connected with the failed coup.\n\nGeneral Akın Öztürk, former Commander of the Turkish Air Force, was the Turkish military attaché to Israel.He was arrested on charges of having played a leading role in the failed coup.Öztürk has denied the charges.\n\nGeneral Adem Huduti, the commander of the Second Army, positioned along the southern borders with Syria and Iraq, and General Erdal Öztürk, the commander of the 3rd Corps, were also arrested.\n\nRear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been stationed at NATO\'s Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk, Virginia, sought asylum in the United States after being recalled by the Turkish government.\n\nIn July 2018, Istanbul\'s 25th Criminal Court sentenced 72 former soldiers involved in the coup attempt to life in prison.\n\nOn 20 June 2019, a terrorism court in Turkey sentenced 151 people to life in prison, including General Akın Öztürk, former commander of Turkish Air Force and the most senior officer involved in the coup.128 people received ""aggravated life"" sentences, which indicates harsh conditions without parole, for their role in the coup, with another 23 receiving standard life sentences.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom President Erdoğan said as one of the principal conspirators, condemned the coup attempt and denied any role in it.""I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey,"" he said in an emailed statement reported by The New York Times.""Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force.I pray to God for Turkey, Turkish citizens, and all those currently in Turkey that this situation is resolved peacefully and quickly.As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nPresident Erdoğan asked the United States to extradite Gülen: ""I call on you again, after there was a coup attempt.Extradite this man in Pennsylvania to Turkey!If we are strategic partners or model partners, do what is necessary.""Prime Minister Yildirim has threatened war against any country that would support Gülen.Turkish Labor Minister Süleyman Soylu said that ""America is behind the coup.""\n\nRegarding the AKP\'s statement against Gülen, Secretary of State Kerry invited the Turkish government ""to present us with any legitimate evidence that withstands scrutiny,"" before they would accept an extradition request.\n\nOn 15 August 2016, former United States diplomat James Jeffrey, who was the United States ambassador to Turkey from 2008 until 2010 made the following remarks: ""The Gülen movement has some infiltration at the least in the military that I am aware of.They of course had extreme infiltration into the police and judiciary earlier.I saw that when I was in Turkey previously, particularly in the Sledgehammer case, Hakan Fidan case, and the corruption cases in 2013.Obviously, significant segment of Turkey\'s bureaucracy was infiltrated and had their allegiance to a movement.That of course is absolutely unacceptable and extremely dangerous.It likely led to the coup attempt.""\n\nOutside Turkey, in Beringen, Belgium, anti-coup protesters attempted to attack a building owned by the pro-Gülen movement group \'Vuslat\'.The police brought in a water cannon to keep the attackers at bay.In news articles it was stated that the police also protected the houses of Gülen supporters.People advocated on social media to go to Beringen once more, and there was unrest in Heusden-Zolder, elsewhere in Belgium.Furthermore, in Somalia the government ordered ""the total closure of all activities"" of an organization linked to the Gülen movement, and gave its staff seven days to leave the country.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, President Erdoğan said Western countries were ""supporting terrorism"" and the military coup, saying ""I\'m calling on the United States: what kind of strategic partners are we, that you can still host someone whose extradition I have asked for?""\n\nOn 31 January 2017, British Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, Alan Duncan said he believed the Gülen movement was responsible for the coup attempt.Duncan went on saying ""the organization which incorporated itself into the state tried to topple the democratic structure in Turkey"".\n\nIn a speech on 29 July 2016, President Erdoğan said U.S. Central Command chief Joseph Votel was ""siding with coup plotters""; Erdoğan said the United States was protecting Fethullah Gülen, whom the Turkish government blames for the coup attempt.Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim made similar comments.In response, Votel said that the Turkish government\'s statements were ""unfortunate and completely inaccurate"" and expressed concern that the mass arrests and firings of military officers would damage military cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey.Similarly, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said that the Turkish military purges were impairing the fight against ISIS.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, in an escalation of tensions with the United States, Erdoğan questioned Turkey\'s relationship with the United States and criticized the West, saying that ""script"" for the abortive putsch last month was ""written abroad"".Erdoğan stated that he had personally asked Obama to extradite Gülen to Turkey.When the U.S. government replied it would need evidence of the cleric\'s guilt before extradition, to which Erdoğan said: ""When you asked for the return of a terrorist, we did not ask for documentation. ...Let us put him on trial.""\n\nYeni Şafak daily, a Turkish pro-state newspaper, stated that the former commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, now-retired United States Army General John F. Campbell, was the ""mastermind"" behind the coup attempt in Turkey.Campbell called the statement ""absolutely ridiculous"" and President Obama said ""Any reports that we had any previous knowledge of a coup attempt, that there was any U.S. involvement in it, that we were anything other than entirely supportive of Turkish democracy are completely false, unequivocally false.""\n\nOn 1 December 2017, Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for American political analyst, former CIA official and former vice chairman of US National Intelligence Council Graham Fuller, stating his involvement in the coup.A career US State Department official who was once CIA Station Chief in Kabul and later went on to be a political scientist in Rand Corporation specializing in the Middle East, Turkish authorities said Fuller attended a meeting in Istanbul on 15 July 2016 involving organization and coordination of the botched coup.Another American among the attendance, as stated by the Turkish prosecutors, was academic Henri Barkey who was named a suspect a week after the failed coup.\n\nThe U.S. consulate in Turkey issued an advisory to U.S. citizens to avoid the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey, which houses about 50 nuclear bombs, until ""normal operations have been restored"".They stated that local authorities were denying access to the air base and that power supplying the air base was shut off.\n\nThe Incirlik base is important to the U.S.-led effort in Syria to combat ISIL and other militants.Nearly 1,500 American personnel are housed in the base.\n\nTwenty-four hours after initial reports that the air base was shut down, United States defense department officials confirmed that the base and its airspace had re-opened to military aircraft and that operations by American aircraft will resume.The Turkish commander of the air base, brig.Gen. Bekir Ercan Van was arrested.After the failure of the coup Gen Bekir Ercan Van sought asylum from the U.S., but his request was denied by U.S.\n\nFollowing the failed coup attempt multiple media outlets have published editorials advocating the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Incirlik Air base as Turkey is unstable.\n\nOn 16 July, anti-coup protesters chanted against locals in areas of Istanbul with high concentration of Alevis, including Okmeydanı and Gazi.Such incidents also occurred in a quarter of Antakya with a high Alevi population, where a motorcyclist stating to be a sharia advocate was lynched.In a neighbourhood of Ankara, shops belonging to Syrians were attacked by a mob.In Malatya, Sunni Islamists harassed residents of an Alevi neighbourhood, particularly the women, and attempted to enter the neighbourhood en masse.Police intervened and blocked all roads leading there.In Kadıköy, people drinking alcohol in public were attacked by a group of religious fundamentalists.\n\nFollowing the arrests, thousands of anti-coup protesters demanded instituting the death penalty against detainees connected with the coup, chanting ""we want the death penalty"".President Erdoğan has been open to reinstituting the death penalty, noting that ""in a democracy, whatever the people want they will get.""Turkish authorities have not executed anyone since 1984, but legally abolished capital punishment only in 2004 as a pre-condition to join the European Union.\n\nEuropean Union officials have been vocal about their opposition to purges by Turkish authorities in connection to the coup.French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that Turkey must work within the framework of the law to uphold Europe\'s democratic principles.Furthermore, on 18 July 2016, Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of Foreign Affairs of the European Union, announced that no country will be admitted into the European Union ""if it introduces the death penalty"".Moreover, German press secretary, Steffen Seibert, stated that reinstituting the death penalty will end Turkey\'s accession talks with the European Union.\n\nTurkey is a member of the Council of Europe, and ratified the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) as part of its terms of membership.The ECHR is an international treaty that includes the abolition of the death penalty among its terms.As such, Turkey is legally bound not to reintroduce the death penalty.\n\nOn 20 July 2016, President Erdoğan announced a three-month state of emergency in response to the attempted coup, invoking Article 120 of the Constitution of Turkey (""Declaration of state of emergency because of widespread acts of violence and serious deterioration of public order"").Under the state of emergency, under Article 121, ""the Council of Ministers, meeting under the chairpersonship of the President of the Republic, may issue decrees having the force of law on matters necessitated by the state of emergency"", with decrees subject to subsequent parliamentary approval.The state of emergency was endorsed by the Parliament on 21 July by 346 votes to 115.The Justice and Development Party and the Nationalist Movement Party supported the state of emergency, whilst the Republican People\'s Party and the Peoples\' Democratic Party opposed it.Prime Minister Yıldırım said at the Parliament that the state of emergency was necessary to ""get rid of this scourge rapidly"".\n\nAs part of the state of emergency, deputy prime minister Kurtulmuş announced that Turkey was temporarily suspending part of the European Convention on Human Rights following the attempted coup, invoking Article 15 of the Convention (""war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation"").The suspensions must be notified to the Council of Europe and may not affect the right to a fair trial or the prohibition on torture.\n\nThis state of emergency in Turkey as well as the hindrance of the right to protest that occurred within such framework have been layered onto a longer history of emergency rules, oppressive legislation and daily government practice that have reinforced both.We can see from this the ""autocratisation"" process in Turkey has thrived of existing legal framework deeply associated in legacies of past ""emergencies"".\n\nOn 3 October 2016 Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş declared the governments intention to extend the state of emergency by a further three months raising objections from both the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) and Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) were critical of the governments use of their emergency powers and declared that they would vote against an extension.\n\nFollowing the National Security Council\'s recommendation for the extension President Erdoğan stated that it was possible that the state of emergency could last for longer than a year prompting outcry from the opposition, Leader of the Main Opposition Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu said that ""The president saying that the state of emergency can last longer than 12 months is strengthening the fear of a counter-coup"" and that it was ""raising the prospect of opportunist measures.""\n\nThe AKP\'s governmental majority allowed the three-month extension to take effect on 19 October 2016.The two-year-long state of emergency was ended on 19 July 2018.\n\nOn 16 July 2016, the media reported that eight Turkish military personnel of various ranks had landed in Greece\'s northeastern city of Alexandroupolis on board a Black Hawk helicopter and claimed political asylum in Greece.While the Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu demanded extradition of ""the eight traitors as soon as possible"", the Greek authorities stated: ""We will follow the procedures of international law.However, we give severe considerations to the fact that [the Turkish military men] are accused, in their own country, of violating the constitutional order and trying to overthrow democracy.""The helicopter was returned to Turkey shortly thereafter.The eight asylum seekers, their asylum case pending, were later transferred to Athens, mainly for safety reasons.On 26 January, the Supreme Court of Greece eventually ruled against their extradition, on the grounds that the eight were unlikely to face a fair trial if returned to their home country and due to concerns over their safety.\n\nOn 15 February 2017, five Turkish commandos illegally entered Greece through the Evros river.However, once they entered the country, the group split.The two of them surrendered to the police and on 20 February 2017, requested political asylum.They were being held in the city of Alexandroupolis.The two men belonged to the Turkish navy.The names given by the two reportedly match the names of two fugitives wanted in relation to the shadowy operation against Erdoğan himself.The Greek government mentioned that the Greek authorities will not allow the country to be dragged into the ongoing feud between the Turkish state and the followers of Gulen.But there were no sign of the other three.According to a lawyer there were indications that the other three have been arrested by Greek authorities who were about to expel them to Turkey.According to new evidence and new information these three ""arrested"" marines were delivered under fast and informal procedures from Greek to Turkish services.\n\nAfter the coup attempt, two Turkish military attachés in Athens, Staff Col. İlhan Yaşıtlı and naval attaché Col. Halis Tunç, had reportedly disappeared along with their families.The Greek foreign ministry canceled the two attachés\' accreditations on 7 August 2016, upon the request of the Turkish foreign ministry.Greek media reported that they might have fled to Italy.On 11 August 2016, the Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu confirmed the reports saying that they had left Greece for Italy on 6 August and adding that Turkey would officially ask the Italian authorities to extradite the two soldiers.\n\nOn 9 August 2016, the media reported that Turkey\'s Rear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been on a United States-based assignment for NATO and after the coup was subject to a detention order in Turkey, had sought asylum in the United States.\n\nIn mid-November 2016, it was officially confirmed that about 40 Turkish military servicemen of various ranks stationed at NATO command structures had applied for asylum in Germany and Belgium.\n\nIn January 2017, Der Spiegel magazine and ARD broadcaster reported that about 40 mostly high-ranking Turkish soldiers who worked at NATO facilities in Germany requested asylum in Germany.\n\nAt the end of February 2017, Germany said it had received 136 asylum requests from Turks holding diplomatic passports since the July coup attempt.The figure was a total for August 2016 to January 2017; some were presumed to be military officers posted to NATO bases in Germany.\n\nIn November 2016, NATO\'s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that Turkish NATO Officers had requested asylum in the countries where they had been posted.He did not name the nations involved or the number of officers, saying it was a matter for those countries to decide.He said: ""Some Turkish officers working in NATO command structure ... have requested asylum in the countries where they are working. ...As always, this is an issue that is going to be assessed and decided by the different NATO allies as a national issue.""\n\nAs of March 2017, Norway have granted asylum for four Turkish soldiers and a military attache.\n\nSeveral Turkish citizens with diplomatic passports have sought political asylum in Switzerland.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, detainees in Turkey have been denied access to legal counsel, have been beaten and tortured.They have not been provided with adequate food, water, or medical care.At least one has attempted suicide.Amnesty International wanted the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture to send people to check on detainees conditions.A person who had been on duty at the Ankara police headquarters said that police denied medical treatment to a detainee.""Let him die.We will say he came to us dead,"" the witness quoted a police doctor as saying.\n\nAlso, Erdoğan has extended the maximum period of detention for suspects from four days to 30, a move Amnesty said increased the risk of torture or other maltreatment of detainees.\n\nTurkish Justice Ministry denied the reports and the Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said on his Twitter account: ""There has not been any torture or assault of detainees in custody,"" in response to reports by Amnesty International.""The claims of torture and assault make up a pre-packaged misinformation campaign formed by members of FETÖ, one which is untrue and distorted,""\n\nOn 7 August, between three and five million people gathered for an anti-coup rally organized by the Turkish authorities in Istanbul.President Erdoğan and the two leaders of the major opposition parties (the Republican People\'s Party and the Nationalist Movement Party) were present.\n\nGreek authorities on several Aegean islands have called for emergency measures to curtail a growing flow of refugees from Turkey; the number of migrants and refugees willing to make the journey across the Aegean has increased noticeably after the failed coup.At Athens officials voiced worries because Turkish monitors overseeing the deal in Greece had been abruptly pulled out after the failed coup without being replaced.Also, the mayor of Kos expressed concern in a letter to the Greek Prime Minister citing the growing influx of refugees and migrants after the failed coup.The Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises (SETE) warned about the prospect of another flare-up in the refugee/migrant crisis due to the Turkish political instability.\n\nVincent Cochetel, the director of the Europe Bureau of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in August 2016 that parts of the EU-Turkey deal about immigration were already de facto suspended because no Turkish police were present at Greek detention centres to oversee deportations.\n\nOn 25 August 2016, seven Turkish citizens sought asylum in Greece.Two were university professors, and their two children applied for asylum in Alexandroupoli after they illegally entered the country from the northeastern border.Also, three businessmen illegally reached the Greek island of Rhodes, and they also applied for asylum.\n\nOn 30 August 2016, a Turkish judge arrived at the Greek island of Chios on a migrant boat, with six Syrian nationals, and sought asylum in the country.He told the Greek coastguard and police officers that he is being persecuted in Turkey for his political beliefs by President Tayyip Erdoğan.The Turkish judge had been arrested for illegally entering the country and was transferred to Athens for his asylum proceedings.The Syrian nationals claimed refugee status.\n\nOn 11 September 2016, four Turkish civilians were arrested by Turkish police.An academic and a teacher attempted to escape to Greece illegally by crossing the Evros river, and the other two because they organized the escape attempt.The academic and the teacher paid a total of 12,500 euros in Istanbul to arrange their escape to Greece.Before their attempt, both the academic and the teacher were suspended from their duties as part of the ongoing probe into the failed coup attempt.Police also seized an air raft, an oar and a pump while detaining the suspects.The court later ordered the two\'s release while the other two suspects, who organized the escape attempt, were arrested.\n\nOn 21 September 2016, ten Turkish civilians, two men, two women and six children landed by boat illegally on the Greek island of Rhodes and sought asylum.They told the Greek authorities they were working in the private sector in Turkey and the Turkish government was persecuting them due to their political beliefs.\n\nOn 29 September 2016, five Turkish nationals, a couple and their child and two other men, arrived in Greece, at Alexandroupolis by crossing the Evros River by boat illegally and requested political asylum.\n\nOn 12 December 2016, one female Turkish national, landed by boat, full of refugees and immigrants, illegally on the Greek island of Lesbos.She requested political asylum.\n\nOn 24 October 2017, Turkish authorities obtained information that 995 Turks have applied for asylum in Greece after the coup attempt.\n\nMore than 1,800 Turkish citizens requested asylum in Greece in 2017.\n\nOn 18 February 2018, seventeen Turkish nationals, including six children, requested asylum in Greece at Oinousses island.\n\nIn August 2018, the former lawmaker for the Peoples\' Democratic Party, Leyla Birlik, requested asylum in Greece after illegally crossing the border near Alexandroupolis.\n\nBerlin mayor, Michael Müller (SPD), said Turkey was waging war on supporters of the Gülen movement in Germany.He said that Turkish officials had approached him and asked him whether he would be prepared to confront the Gülen movement in Berlin critically and, if necessary, to support measures against it.The mayor rejected the idea and made it very clear that Turkish conflicts could not be waged in the city.\n\nDer Spiegel presented classified documents, which showed that Turkey\'s secret service (MIT) had asked Germany\'s foreign intelligence agency (BND) for help in rounding up Gülen supporters in Germany.The Turkish secret service wanted the BND to use its influence to spur German lawmakers into taking action against Gülen supporters and extraditing them to Turkey.Also, Turkey\'s government has sent German authorities requests for searches and extraditions linked to supporters of Fethullah Gülen in Germany.\n\nIn Germany businesses thought to be in support of the Gülen movement have been harassed by Erdoğan supporters.\n\nAfter the failed coup, there was a massive demonstration in Cologne at Germany, in late July, in support of Turkish President Erdoğan.Erdoğan wanted to address the participants via video but was rejected by the local authorities and the German Constitutional Court due to security concerns.Turkey said that the ban was unacceptable and a violation of freedom of expression.\n\nGerman authorities said Turkish mosques in Germany were playing Turkish politics and worried that Turkey\'s internal politics spilled over into German cities.For years, German authorities had encouraged Turkey\'s state-run religious institution Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs usually referred to as DİTİB to provide Islamic preachers and teachers and Gülen Movement Schools for the large Turkish diaspora in Germany.DİTİB manages some 900 mosques in Germany.Gülen movement runs 100 educational facilities in Germany.\n\nAfter the failed coup DİTİB published a sermon praising ""our noble nation"" for rising against ""a wretched network"" that had sown ""seeds of sedition, rebellion and hostility.""According to Volker Beck, a member of the center-left Greens in Germany\'s Bundestag, ""That was not a religious text.It was a declaration of obedience to Mr. Erdoğan and his measures since the coup attempt,"" Volker Kauder, parliamentary group leader of the Germany\'s ruling Christian Democrats, the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU)/Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) faction, said Turkish-Germans should be loyal to Germany first and foremost.\n\nGermans of Turkish origin are being pressured in Germany by informers and officers of Turkey\'s MIT spy agency.According to reports Turkey had 6,000 informants plus MIT officers in Germany who were putting pressure on ""German Turks"".Hans-Christian Ströbele said that there was an ""unbelievable"" level of ""secret activities"" in Germany by Turkey\'s MIT agency.According to Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, not even the former communist East German Stasi secret police had managed to run such a large ""army of agents"" in the former West Germany: ""Here, it\'s not just about intelligence gathering, but increasingly about intelligence service repression.""\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nGermany\'s Office for Migration and Refugees said on 18 November 2016, it had received 4,437 political asylum requests from Turkish citizens up to October, compared to 1,767 for the whole of last year.""We must expect that the number of Turks who are seeking political asylum in Germany will continue to rise,"" said Stephan Mayer, the domestic policy speaker of the union coalition in the Bundestag.\n\nOn 10 December 2016, eleven Turkish nationals, 10 adults and one child, in a martial arts group have applied for asylum in Germany.\n\nAs of January 2018, Germany was first place and Greece second as EU destinations of choice for Turkish nationals requesting asylum after the coup attempt.\n\nTurkish police have carried out simultaneous raids in 18 cities against companies associated with United States-based Fethullah Gülen.The state-run Anadolu Agency said police searched 204 premises and detained 187 businessmen for ""membership in a terror organization"" and ""providing financial support to a terror organization"".All suspects\' assets were seized.\n\nWikiLeaks released Turkish emails and documents to respond to the Turkish government\'s purges that followed the coup attempt.In turn, the Turkish Telecommunications Communications Board blocked access to the WikiLeaks website.On 17 July 2016 Wikileaks had announced on Twitter, the leak of approximately 300,000 emails and over 500,000 documents, including those to and from AKP.\n\nWikiLeaks stated that it was attacked shortly after 17 July announcement of the planned publication and hypothesized that Turkish authorities were responsible.WikiLeaks stated in a tweet, ""our infrastructure is under sustained attack.""Tweets from WikiLeaks include ""We are unsure of the true origin of the attack.The timing suggests a Turkish state power faction or its allies.We will prevail & publish.""and: ""Turks will likely be censored to prevent them reading our pending release of 100k+ docs on politics leading up to the coup."", ""We ask that Turks are ready with censorship bypassing systems such as TorBrowser and uTorrent""; ""And that everyone else is ready to help them bypass censorship and push our links through the censorship to come.""\n\nUpon the release of the email dump, it has been reported that the emails contain little to no damning information, and instead are just mails from a public mailing list, but also linked externally to ""voter information on all of the women registered to vote in 78 out of Turkey\'s 81 provinces"".\n\nSeveral places were renamed to commemorate the failed coup: Boğaziçi Köprüsü (Bosphorus Bridge) → 15 Temmuz Şehitler Köprüsü Kızılay Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Kızılay Demokrasi Meydanı Ahmet Taner Kışlalı Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Milli İrade Meydanı (Reverted to original name a few days later) Büyük İstanbul Otogarı → İstanbul 15 Temmuz Demokrasi Otogarı In TRT, Yeni Haber Stüdyosu → 15 Temmuz Millet Stüdyosu Kazan → Kahramankazan about the province\'s local people\'s resistance to the coup plotters.Kahraman means ""hero"" in Turkish Niğde University → Niğde Ömer Halisdemir University\n\nIn 2018, the Istanbul Municipal Council decided to change the names of a total of 90 streets that included words which could be associated with FETÖ.\n\nThe Presidency of Religious Affairs stated that it would not be providing religious funeral services to the dead coupists, except for ""privates and low-ranking officers compelled by force and threats who found themselves in the midst of the conflict without full knowledge of anything"".\n\nA document dated 26 September 2016 showed that Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) asked Turkish missions and religious representatives abroad to profile Gülen movement expatriates living in their respective foreign countries.Gülen-linked schools, businesses, foundations, associations, media outlets and others were also included in the reports.Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs has gathered intelligence via imams from 38 countries.\n\nBelgium officials said they would withdraw recognition of Diyanet mosques in the country if necessary.\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nOn 21 December 2016, the Turkish government has recalled Yusuf Acar, the religious affairs attaché of the Turkish Embassy in the Netherlands, after Dutch authorities said he was spying.Acar collected information of people who sympathize with Fethullah Gülen at Netherlands and passed it on to the Turkish authorities.The Dutch government called spying activities an ""unwanted and non-acceptable interference in the lives of Dutch citizens.""and the attaché was reportedly declared persona non grata and received a ""deportation warning"" by Dutch authorities.\n\nOn 26 January 2017, President Erdoğan, during his visit to Tanzania, asked his Tanzanian counterpart John Magufuli to take action against the network of Fethullah Gülen.\n\nIn April 2017 it was announced that President Erdoğan planned to establish a purpose-built museum dedicated to the coup events, called the ""Museum of the 15 July: Martyrs and Democracy"", to be located in Kahramankazan, a town near Ankara.Paid for by Turkish Ministry of Culture funds, it is planned to open at the end of 2018.The museum opened in December 2019\n\nAmong the Turkish opposition parties, the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) issued a statement expressing their public opposition to the coup, and the Hürriyet Daily News reported that Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bahçeli telephoned Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım to express his opposition to the coup.The co-chairs of the opposition Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) issued a statement saying that the party was ""under all circumstances and as a matter of principle against all kinds of coup.""Amongst the minor parties, left-wing nationalist Patriotic Party\'s Doğu Perinçek backed democracy, when he held Gülen and the Americans responsible.Kurdish militant separatist organization Kurdistan Workers\' Party, which Turkey and its allies label as a terrorist organization, urged their supporters to stay away from the coup and rather defend their people, while the Communist Party called upon the people to overthrow the AKP government which they called an ""enemy of humanity"".\n\nDuring the first hours of the coup plotters\' moves of blocking Istanbul\'s bridges and flying fighter jets low over Istanbul and Ankara, Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjørn Jagland tweeted against the coup attempt and underlined that ""any attempt to overthrow the democratically elected leaders is unacceptable"".\n\nRussia\'s President Vladimir Putin called Erdoğan out of solidarity before all NATO member countries\' heads following the coup attempt.Erdoğan thanked the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev – who was the first president to show solidarity after the coup attempt – for his support in solving the 7-month crisis over downed Russian Sukhoi Su-24 and the Prime Minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, who was among the first NATO country leaders to condemn the coup attempt, already from the early hours of Saturday.\n\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the then prime minister of Pakistan, was all praise for the people of Turkey and the AKP government and strongly condemned what he termed as an attempt to undermine democracy in Turkey.""We deeply admire the resolve of the brave and resilient Turkish people, who stood up against the forces of darkness and anarchy to express their support and commitment to democracy,"" the PM said in a statement issued from his office.\n\nThe majority of countries either expressed their support for the government or called for restraint.On 16 July 2016, however, a proposed United Nations Security Council statement denouncing the coup was not accepted by Egypt, a non-permanent member of the Council at the time, due to textual disagreements.Egyptian diplomats said that the council is ""in no position to qualify, or label [the Turkish] government – or any other government for that matter – as democratically elected or not"".Objection by the United States and the UK – permanent members of the Security Council – led to Egypt proposing a new statement calling for all sides to ""respect the democratic and constitutional principles and the rule of law"", which was rejected, preventing the condemnation of the coup attempt by the Security Council.The leader of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky supported the coup attempt.\n\nAl-Monitor reported that ""Unlike Ankara\'s Western allies, Iran did not wait for the coup\'s failure to speak up.Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif voiced support for democracy in a Twitter message in the early hours of the unrest, writing ""Stability, and democracy in Turkey are paramount"".In a subsequent phone call after the failure of the coup attempt, President Hassan Rouhani told Erdoğan the coup attempt was ""a test to identify your domestic and foreign friends and enemies.""An Iranian official pointed out parallels between the coup attempt in Turkey and the coup against Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mussadiq in 1953: ""What we know is that this attempt was triggered by foreign hands.We have experienced the same thing in the past.Since Mr. Erdogan wants to play a more positive path in the region today, they want to overthrow him.""\n\nMustafa Akıncı, President of Northern Cyprus, welcomed the fact that ""no community in Turkey ... applauded the coup as they have done in the past.""Azerbaijan strongly condemned the attempted military coup in Turkey and considered such actions unacceptable according to a statement from Novruz Mammadov, deputy head of the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration and chief of the foreign relations department.\n\nEuropean Commissioner dealing with Turkey\'s EU membership bid, Johannes Hahn, said it appears Turkey\'s government prepared arrest lists of political opponents before the coup attempt and had been waiting for the right time to act.In this sense, EU reported that as a main criticism to put this issue in the category of terrorism become the violation of the fundamental rights and fundamental values of the citizens.Hence, it underlines a total divergence of opinions and mentality between EU and Turkey which reached a deadlock here especially after the 15th of July in 2016.\n\nOn 19 July 2016, White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said during a press briefing that President Barack Obama has held a phone conversation with President Erdoğan: ""The President used the phone call to reiterate once again the strong commitment of the United States to the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey.The President pledged any needed assistance to the Turkish government as they conduct an investigation to determine exactly what happened.""\n\nOn 20 July 2016, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""Turkey has a large armed force, professional armed forces and ...I am certain they will continue as a committed and strong NATO ally.""On a statement released on 10 August 2016, the Secretary General once more strongly condemned the attempted coup and reiterated full support for Turkey\'s democratic institutions.He also expressed support for the elected Turkish government and respect for the courage of the Turkish people for resisting the coup plotters.\n\nOn 29 July 2016, the commander of U.S. Central Command, General Joseph Votel, denied statements by Turkey\'s president Erdoğan that he has supported the coup attempt in Turkey.\n\nOn 1 August 2016, United States Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, General Joseph Dunford, visited Turkey and condemned the coup attempt.Dunford said: ""The consistent theme throughout the day was a reaffirmation of the importance of the U.S.-Turkey relationship – the need for us to cooperate.""\n\nOn July, 20, there were reports that a group of Turkish military commandos coup fugitives would try to cross from Turkey to the island of Symi, in the southeastern Aegean, at Greece.The Hellenic Coast Guard was on alert and increased the patrols in the area, especially after a group of inflatable dinghies and other vessels were seen departing from Datça, on the Turkish coast, in the direction of Symi, they monitored the movements of the Turkish vessels, which remained in Turkish waters.Furthermore, a contingent of the Hellenic Police was dispatched to Symi to conduct checks there.The Greek government had been anticipating a possible attempt by participants in the failed coup to come to Greece and took the reports seriously.Turkish F-16 fighter jets were also scrambled to check reports that missing Turkish coast guard vessels had appeared in Greek waters in the Aegean.Later on the day, the Turkish interior ministry denied reports that rebel soldiers might have ""hijacked"" a vessel to flee to Greece.The Greek armed forces remained on alert the throughout the day for potential coup fugitives.\n\nAccording to Michael Rubin, from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Erdoğan had himself to blame for the coup.Following an increasingly Islamist agenda, Erdoğan had reportedly ""dropped any pretense of governing for all Turks.""After ""fanning the flames"" at the 2013 Gezi Park protests, he transformed the predominantly Kurdish-inhabited areas of southeastern Turkey ""into a war zone reminiscent of the worst days of the 1980s.""The biggest problem, according to Rubin, might have been Erdoğan\'s foreign policy, which managed to turn the initial ""no problems with neighbors"" doctrine into a situation where the country has problems with almost every neighbor and has even alienated some of its allies and friends.Rubin previously worked as an official at the Pentagon and less than 4 months before the coup, he wrote an article in Newsweek magazine titled, ""Will There Be a Coup Against Erdogan in Turkey?""\n\nBritish Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk warned that ""too late did Erdoğan realize the cost of the role he had chosen for his country.It\'s one thing to say sorry to Putin and patch up relations with Netanyahu; but when you can no longer trust your army, there are more serious matters to concentrate upon.""Even if this coup may have failed, Fisk expected another to follow in the months or years to come.\n\nTurkish professor Akın Ünver described the coup d\'état attempt as ""more of a mutiny"".\n\nThe name of the ""Peace at Home Council"" – Yurtta Sulh Konseyi – is derived from Atatürk\'s famous saying \'Peace at Home, Peace in the World\'.Journalist Ezgi Başaran said that ""the statement of the junta, that was [...] read on the [...] government TV [channel] as the coup got under way, bore a strong resemblance to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk\'s famous address to the Turkish Youth.[...] On the other hand, given that these references are too obvious, they may have been intentionally included to insinuate a Kemalist junta rather than a Gülenist one.""\n\nThe citizen journalism site Bellingcat published an analysis of the messages of a WhatsApp group consisting of high-ranking military officials who had taken part in the coup covering their activities including them killing several people.The messages were cross referenced with video footage.The group was named ""Yurtta sulh"" which refers to a peace at home speech and they seem secular and military with no references to Gülen or anything related during the several hours of messaging.\n\nNews reports have suggested that the coup ringleader was Adil Öksüz.Some believe Öksüz to have been an operative with Turkish intelligence.\n\nGerman Islamic studies scholar said the putschists tried to forestall a large-scale purge of judiciary and military, the implementation of which had already started on Saturday, the day after the coup attempt.According to Turkish investigative journalist Ahmet Şık, a list of officials to be purged had been ready compiled by the attorney-general of Izmir, Okan Bato, and was approved by President Erdoğan.According to this version, the putschists had to quickly bring forward their coup attempt before being disposed and arrested.\n\nDuring and after the events, several politicians and commentators suggested that the government knew about the coup in advance and possibly directed it.The facts that the coup attempt began in the evening rather than at a more inconspicuous time and that the events were largely confined to Ankara and Istanbul contributed to doubts about the authenticity of the coup attempt.Journalists and opposition politicians branded it a \'tragic comedy\' and \'theatre play\'.Advocates of such theories pointed to how Erdoğan stood to gain from the coup attempt in terms of increasing his popularity and support for his calls for an executive presidency, while being able to legitimize further crackdowns on judicial independence and the opposition in general.\n\nOther elements that were reported to support the theory included: no list of demands by the coup plotters, the organization and response of the police, the long lists of arrests that seemed to be ready surprisingly quickly (including arrests of 2,745 judges and 2,839 soldiers), and the obvious nature of the coup actions.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom Erdoğan had said as being one of the principal conspirators, commented, ""I don\'t believe that the world believes the accusations made by President Erdoğan.There is a possibility that it could be a staged coup and it could be meant for further accusations [against the Gülenists].""Journalist Cengiz Çandar, a veteran observer of Turkey\'s coups, said ""I have never seen any with this magnitude of such inexplicable sloppiness.""Prominent Hizmet (Gülen movement) spokesman Alp Aslandogan said, referencing that the Turkish Air Force commander met with Erdoğan before 15 July, that certain legal documentation related to the coup seemed written beforehand, arguing that within ""the indictment written by a prosecutor on the night of 15 July to 16 July, there were events there that didn\'t actually happen.Some events did happen, but those events didn\'t happen by the time the document started.It looks like a bigger plan was there, and part of the plan did not come to pass.""\n\nThe organization and spontaneous synchronization by large numbers of mosques was perceived to be unachievable unless there had been prior preparation, with journalists also pointing to how Erdoğan could have strategically used the call to prayer to invoke religious sentiment in a political situation as a veiled attack on state secularism.\n\nThousands of arrests and purges were conducted by Turkish authorities between 16 and 18 July 2016.The sheer number of these arrests made at such a speed could only be done so if the ""Turkish government had all those lists ready"", as suggested by Johannes Hahn, European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, on 18 July 2016.Hahn also said that because these lists were already available immediately after the coup, the ""event was prepared"" and the lists were to be used ""at a certain stage"".\n\nMehmet Dişli, who was seen giving orders to the coup plotters and who was the one who put a belt around Hulusi Akar\'s neck to make him sign, is the brother of Şaban Dişli, a former vice president of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and confidant of Erdoğan.\n\nSeveral social media users have compared the coup attempt to the Reichstag fire in 1933, which Adolf Hitler used as an excuse to suspend civil liberties and order mass arrests of his opponents.Politico correspondent Ryan Heath said that ""the coup was staged to allow Erdoğan to purge the military of opponents and increase his grip on the country"".Heath used Twitter to share comments from his Turkish source, who called the events of Friday night a ""fake coup"" which would help a ""fake democracy warrior"" (referring to Erdoğan).The source said: ""Probably we\'ll see an early election [in] which he\'ll try to guarantee an unbelievable majority of the votes.And this will probably guarantee another 10–15 years of authoritarian, elected dictatorship.""\n\nThe New York Times reported that some Turkish citizens believed the coup attempt was staged by Erdoğan to improve his public image and popularity, while cracking down on political opponents and expanding his power.Critics found it suspect that reportedly no government officials were arrested or harmed during the attempted coup, which—among other factors—raised the suspicion of a false flag event staged by the Turkish government to crack down on opposition parties.Those in Turkey suggesting that the coup was staged are also being questioned by the government.\n\nPoliticians and journalists who were skeptical of the authenticity of the coup plot said that in reality, a \'civil coup\' had effectively been staged against the Armed Forces and Judiciary, both of which were extensively purged of stated Gülen supporters by the government shortly after the events.Skeptics said that the coup would be used as an excuse for further erosion of judicial independence and a crackdown on the opposition, giving the AKP greater and unstoppable power over all state institutions and paving the way for a more radical Islamist agenda at odds with the founding principles of the Turkish Republic.\n\nJustice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said in late July 2016 that Turkish social media users who said the government was staging the coup faced investigation: ""Just look at the people who are saying on social media that this was theatre.Public prosecutors are already investigating them.Most of them are losers who think it is an honor to die for Fethullah Gülen\'s command.""\n\nOn 12 July 2017, Stockholm Center for Freedom, a monitoring group with reported links to the Gülen movement, published a controversial report stating that President Erdogan orchestrated the coup bid as a false flag to consolidate his powers, set up his opposition for a mass persecution, and push Turkish Armed Forces into a military incursion into Syria.According to the report, it uncovered new evidence from 11 July 2016, four days before the planned coup bid, that a secret plan was circulated among select group of Armed Forces to give an appearance of a coup attempt.The plan was sanctioned by intelligence and military chiefs with the approval of Erdogan.\n\nIn early November 2017, Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for , former Director of the Middle East Program of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, stating that he is an agent of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), that he was present in Istanbul during the 2016 Turkish coup attempt, and that he was one of the key organizers behind the coup attempt.Around 1 December, the Istanbul prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for Graham E. Fuller, an American author and political analyst specializing in Islamic extremism after a long CIA career and holding the role of vice-chair of the United States National Intelligence Council.The prosecutor\'s office based the warrant on suspicion of Fuller helping to plan the coup attempt.Hürriyet stated that Turkish authorities believed that they had traced Fuller\'s location before the attempted coup and afterward when he left Turkey.\n\nBarkey denied his reported role in the coup, describing the claims as ""so ludicrous that they do not even deserve the term \'science fiction\'.""\n\nDeep state in Turkey The Imam\'s Army List of coups and coup attempts since 2010 List of modern conflicts in the Middle East List of attacks on legislatures\n', 'Claim_Context': 'In March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.

108,"{'Wiki_Title': '2016 Turkish coup attempt', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'On 15 July 2016, a faction within the Turkish Armed Forces, organized as the Peace at Home Council, attempted a coup d\'état against state institutions, including the government and president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.They attempted to seize control of several places in Ankara, Istanbul, Marmaris and elsewhere, such as the Asian side entrance of the Bosphorus Bridge, but failed to do so after forces and civilians loyal to the state defeated them.The Council cited an erosion of secularism, elimination of democratic rule, disregard for human rights, and Turkey\'s loss of credibility in the international arena as reasons for the coup.The government said it had evidence the coup leaders were linked to the Gülen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the Republic of Turkey and led by Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish businessman and a well-known Islamic scholar who lives in exile in Pennsylvania.The Turkish government alleged that Gülen was behind the coup (which Gülen denied) and that the United States was harboring him.Events surrounding the coup attempt and the purges in its aftermath reflect a complex power struggle between Islamist elites in Turkey.\n\nDuring the coup attempt, over 300 people were killed and more than 2,100 were injured.Many government buildings, including the Turkish Parliament and the Presidential Palace, were bombed from the air.Mass arrests followed, with at least 40,000 detained, including at least 10,000 soldiers and 2,745 judges, for being affiliated with the coup attempt.15,000 education staff were also suspended and the licenses of 21,000 teachers working at private institutions were revoked after the government stated they were loyal to Gülen.More than 77,000 people have been arrested and over 160,000 fired from their jobs, on reports of connections to Gülen.\n\nThere were many reactions against the coup attempt, both domestically and internationally.The main opposition parties in Turkey condemned the attempt, while several international leaders—such as those of the United States, NATO, the European Union, and neighboring countries—called for ""respect of the democratic institutions in Turkey and its elected officials.""Many international organizations also opposed the coup.The United Nations Security Council, however, did not denounce the coup after disagreements over the phrasing of a statement.Iran opposed the coup and advised Erdogan to defeat the coup plotters.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the head of United States Central Command, General Joseph Votel, was ""siding with coup plotters"", after Votel criticized the Turkish government for arresting the Pentagon\'s contacts in Turkey.\n\nIn March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.The same month, the British Parliament\'s Foreign Affairs Select Committee said some Gulenists were involved in the coup d\'état attempt but found no hard evidence that Fethullah Gülen masterminded the failed coup and found no evidence to justify the United Kingdom designating the Gülen movement as a ""terrorist organization"".\n\nSince the 1970s, followers of the influential cleric Fethullah Gülen had assumed increasingly important positions within the Turkish state apparatus.Gülen several times advised his followers to take key positions in society and government, if necessary with a secret identity to avoid opposition from the laicistic Turkish army and government.Nevertheless, at the start of the 21st century, Gülen\'s followers achieved crucial positions of power in Turkey (and beyond) with a vast network of newspapers, TV channels, schools, associations, lobby organizations, financial institutions and positions within the state such as the army and the judiciary.Initially, the then Prime Minister Erdogan seemingly tolerated the power of the Gülen movement because of common interests such as limiting the undemocratic political power of the military, but also because of impotence and fear of Gülen\'s power within Turkey.\n\nA series of events eventually led to a rift between Erdogan and Gülen.For example, prosecutors that allegedly were aligned with the Gülen movement tried to arrest the intelligence chief Hakan Fidan for the peace negotiations with the PKK, and by extension PM Erdogan subsequently, as the Turkish secret service is directly subordinate to the prime minister of Turkey.During this period (2010-2013), state secrets were leaked, fraud was committed with the entrance exams for government employees (KPSS), a change of power occurred at the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) and (sex)tapes of both government members and opposition members were leaked.Following these events and other incidents, the Turkish government decided to designate the Gülen movement as parallel state and FETÖ (Fethullahist Terror Organization).Alleged Gülen supporters were fired or arrested.The coup attempt that followed is therefore also described by some analysts as a last desperate attempt by Gülenists to retain power.\n\nIt is widely reported that Kemalist ideology played a huge role in motivating the 15 July 2016 coup attempt, like all previous political interventions in the history of Turkey\'s military coups.Since the establishment of multiparty democracy in Turkey in 1946, the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), together with the judiciary, have viewed themselves as guardians of Kemalist ideals and the secular Turkish nationalist state established under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk against political parties that have promoted a larger role for Islam and minorities in public life.The military and judiciary have regularly intervened in politics to block or ban popular parties representing conservative Muslim Turks, attempting to relax the restrictions on traditional religious practices, such as women\'s wearing of headscarves.The military has toppled four elected governments: by coups in 1960 and 1980, and by military decisions in 1971 and 1997.The military has also banned several major political parties.In 1998, Erdoğan, then-mayor of Istanbul, was banned for life from politics and jailed because he had read a religious poem by Ziya Gökalp several years before, at a public meeting.In 2007, the military expressed its opposition to the election of Abdullah Gül, of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), as president, by issuing an e-memorandum.Still, Gül was eventually elected when the AKP won both a referendum on the matter.Also, a snap election, and the party returned with a larger majority in the parliament.The military cited erosion of secularism as one of the reasons for the coup in the statement published on the day of the coup.\n\nAs opposed to previous political interventions by the Turkish military, Turkey\'s AKP government and pro-state media maintain that the 15 July 2016 coup attempt was not motivated by allegiance to Kemalist ideology, but rather to the vast political, economic, and religious network led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen.Between 2007 and 2012, high-profile Kemalists, including high-ranking officers of the Turkish Armed Forces, faced a series of trials and purges, under reports of involvement in a secret society codenamed ""Ergenekon.""Supported by Islamist (both pro-Gülen and pro-Erdoğan) prosecutors, security officials, and media, the purges allowed lower-rank Islamist officers to assume high-ranking military positions.They were seen as a bid by Turkey\'s civilian leaders under President Erdoğan to establish dominance over the military.In these trials in 2013 – viewed as ""sensational"" and ""one of the biggest in recent Turkish history"" – 275 people, including senior military officers, journalists, lawyers, and academics, were said to be involved in the so-called ""Ergenekon"" conspiracy, reportedly plotting a coup in 2003/04 against then–Prime Minister Erdoğan.Additionally, some military officers were said to be involved in a separate reported plot, Sledgehammer.Simultaneously, Erdoğan promoted lower-ranking officers up the chain of command, ensuring that the military chief of staff was loyal to him and thereby demoralizing the army.\n\nThe AKP\'s alliance with Gülen started to collapse during 2013 as Gülenists targeted the AKP using corruption charges.After the split, Erdoğan decided it would be advantageous to rehabilitate the army.The ""Ergenekon"" convictions were overturned in April 2016 by the Court of Cassation, which ruled that the existence of the network was unproven.\n\nIn 2013, law enforcement efforts to fight corruption, which had led to the 2013 corruption scandal in Turkey, were faulted by Erdoğan.The anti-corruption efforts were a source of tension between the Gülenists and the AKP.In political analysis in the months prior to the coup attempt, the incidence of corruption was reported to be ""rife"" in Turkey.Following the coup attempt, some coup leaders cited corruption as a reason for their actions.\n\nOn 13 July, less than two days before the coup was launched, Erdoğan signed a bill giving Turkish soldiers immunity from prosecution while taking part in domestic operations.The bill requires cases against commanders to be approved by the prime minister, while district governors may sign cases against lower-ranking soldiers.The immunity bill was seen as part of the détente between the government and the armed forces.The latter has increasingly been taking over military operations in Kurdish-inhabited areas from police and paramilitary units.\n\nOn 15 July 2016, as reported just before 23:00 EEST (UTC+3), military jets were spotted flying over Ankara, and both the Fatih Sultan Mehmet and Bosphorus bridges in Istanbul were closed.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said military action was being ""taken outside the chain of command"" and it was an ""illegal attempt"" to seize power by ""part of the military"".He further said that those involved ""will pay the highest price.""Local media also reported tanks in Istanbul\'s Atatürk Airport.It was reported that Internet users within Turkey were blocked from accessing Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.Twitter later stated that it had ""no reason to think we\'ve been fully blocked"".Some hostages were taken at military headquarters, including the Turkish Chief of the General Staff Hulusi Akar.At around 21:00, the coupists had invited Salih Zeki Çolak, the commander of the Turkish Land Forces to the military headquarters.When he arrived, he was immediately apprehended.Abidin Ünal, head of the Turkish Air Force, who had been attending a wedding in Istanbul, was abducted from there by soldiers who descended from a helicopter.The coupists then tried to force Akar to sign the coup declaration, almost strangling him using a belt in the process.He refused and was then taken to the Akıncı Air Base and other commanders at the headquarters.The military also entered the Justice and Development Party\'s offices in Istanbul and asked people to leave.\n\nEarly reports said President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was safe in Marmaris, south-west Turkey, where he had been on holiday.\n\nFrom around 23:00 to midnight, helicopters bombed the police special forces headquarters and police air force headquarters in Gölbaşı, just outside of Ankara.The attacks left 42 dead and 43 injured.Türksat headquarters in Gölbaşı was also attacked, killing two security personnel.\n\nAt around 23:50, soldiers occupied Taksim Square in central Istanbul.\n\nAt 00:02, it was reported by Reuters that soldiers were inside the buildings of the state broadcaster, the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), in Ankara.During the coup attempt, soldiers forced anchor Tijen Karaş to read out a statement saying that ""the democratic and secular rule of law has been eroded by the current government"" and that Turkey was now led by the Peace at Home Council who would ""ensure the safety of the population.""The statement read in part: ""Turkish Armed Forces have completely taken over the administration of the country to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedoms, the rule of law and general security that was damaged.[...] All international agreements are still valid.We hope that all of our good relationships with all countries will continue.""The plotters said they had ""done so to preserve democratic order, and that the rule of law must remain a priority"".The statement also ordered temporary martial law (sıkıyönetim), and said a new constitution would be prepared ""as soon as possible"".TRT was then taken off air.\n\nOther media outlets were also raided by the putschists, such as Turkish newspaper Hürriyet and private broadcaster CNN Türk.\n\nReuters reported on 15 July that an EU source described the coup as ""well orchestrated,"" and predicted that ""given the scale of the operation, it is difficult to imagine they will stop short of prevailing.""Another EU diplomat said that the Turkish ambassador in his capital was shocked and ""taking it very seriously"".\n\nThe Peace at Home Council was reportedly chaired by Muharrem Köse.\n\nAdana: Upon receiving the intelligence that thirty soldiers from the 10th Air Base Command would move to the base where the regional and provincial gendarmerie commands were located, the police prevented the soldiers from leaving the guardhouse with TOMA and armored vehicles and blocked them.Bitlis: In the Tatvan district of Bitlis, on the orders of Brigade Commander Arif Seddar Afşar, helicopters were circulated in the skies of Tatvan and fired at the city.The brigade command left the municipality\'s construction equipment in front of the barracks in case there was a tank operation in the district.Denizli: Approximately five hundred officers and non-commissioned officers who participated in the coup attempt surrendered to the gendarmerie and police forces.They were interrogated at Çardak District Gendarme Command.Kars: With the order of Kars 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, the soldiers who came with tanks and armored personnel carriers surrounded the Police Headquarters building and wanted to detain Faruk Karaduman, the chief of police.At the same hours, the invitation of Deputy Governors, 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, went to the command.Kocaeli: Turkcell\'s data center in Gebze was raided by soldiers who participated in the coup attempt.Soldiers who tried to interrupt the internet service were detained.Malatya: A rebellious soldier opened fire inside a base of the Turkish 2nd Army, damaging six vehicles.The base was besieged by police and loyal soldiers, and the shooter was captured.Marmaris: Three military helicopters carried out a bomb attack on the hotel where Erdoğan was staying.Forty rebellious soldiers of the Special Forces Command clashed with the police in the region.Mersin: Mersin Garrison and Mediterranean Region Commander Admiral Nejat Atilla Demirhan called Mersin Provincial Police Deputy Chief Yakup Usta and Gendarmerie Colonel Mustafa Bakçepınar and stated that the Turkish Armed Forces had taken over the administration.He introduced himself as the martial law garrison commander and ordered Mersin Governor Özdemir Çakacak and district governors to be taken into custody.Demirhan and Dağdelen, who made the same announcement with the police radio obtained from Mersin Police Department, were detained through the operation of the security forces.Sakarya: Sakarya Governorship was captured with armored personnel carriers, military trucks and many military jeeps from the military unit in the Kandıra district of Kocaeli.As a reinforcement, two military vehicles full of soldiers from the Sakarya central division command had to return to their barracks in the face of the resistance of the police and the harsh reaction of the people who took to the streets against the putschists.The vehicles occupying the Sakarya Governorate were seized by the citizens and the soldiers in them were neutralized and handed over to the security forces.Afterwards, citizens and security forces entered the governor\'s office and neutralized the soldiers there and suppressed the uprising in the province.Eight civilian citizens were injured as a result of the fire opened by the military during the incident.Şırnak: Çakırsöğüt Gendarmerie Commando Brigadier General Ali Osman Gürcan and 309 soldiers, that participated in the coup attempt, were detained by the security forces.\n\nTurkey\'s Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım responded to the events by stating that an ""illegal action is taking place outside of the chain of command"".He also said that ""the government elected by the people remains in charge and this government will only go when the people say so.""The Turkish Presidential office said President Erdoğan was on holiday inside Turkey and condemned the coup attempt as an attack on democracy.A presidential source also said Erdoğan and his government were still in power.The first messages from Erdoğan were transmitted at around 00:23At about 01:00, Erdoğan did a FaceTime interview with CNN Türk, in which he called upon his supporters to take to the streets in defiance of the military-imposed curfew, saying ""There is no power higher than the power of the people.Let them do what they will at the public squares and airports.""Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş appeared on live television, saying Turkey\'s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is still in charge of the government.The mayor of Ankara, Melih Gökçek of the AKP, encouraged people to go out to the city\'s streets in defiance, despite a curfew imposed by the military.Erdoğan\'s plane took off from Dalaman Airport near Marmaris at 23:47, but had to wait in the air south of Atatürk for the airport to be secured.His plane landed at 02:50\n\nThe First Army General Command in Istanbul stated in a news conference that the TSK did not support the coup and the perpetrators represented a tiny faction that were on the verge of being brought under control.Istanbul Atatürk Airport was closed; all flights from the airport were cancelled.There was an explosion in the TRT broadcasting headquarters and gunfire was reported in Ankara.Soon after, it was stormed by a crowd of civilians and police, with four soldiers inside reportedly being ""neutralized"".The channel went back on air and Karaş, who had previously announced the coup, said live that she had been held hostage and forced to read the declaration of the coup at gunpoint.\n\nBy 01:00, it was reported that the military had pulled its forces from the Atatürk airport and people were coming inside, but by 01:13, it was reported that tanks were inside the airport and gunfire was heard.\n\nTanks opened fire near the Turkish Parliament Building.The parliamentary building was also hit from the air.Injuries were reported among protesters following gunfire on Bosphorus Bridge.\n\nA helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was shot down by a Turkish military F-16 fighter jet.There were also reports of pro-state jets flying over Ankara to ""neutralize"" helicopters used by those behind the coup.\n\nAt 03:08, a military helicopter opened fire on the Turkish parliament.At 03:10, Turkish Armed Forces stated on their website that they had complete control over the country.At 03:12, Yıldırım made a statement saying that the situation was under control and that a no-fly zone was declared over Ankara and that military planes that still flew would be shot down.\n\nIt was reported that the Turkish parliament had been bombed again at 03:23 and 03:33.A helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was also seen flying by it.Half an hour following the report of 12 deaths and 2 injuries in the parliament, soldiers entered CNN Türk\'s headquarters and forced the studio to go off air.After an hour of interruption by the pro-coup soldiers, CNN Türk resumed its broadcast.Later, İsmail Kahraman said a bomb exploded at a corner of the public relations building inside the parliament, with no deaths but several injuries among police officers.\n\nAt around 04:00 two or three helicopters attacked Erdogan\'s hotel.According to eyewitness accounts, ten to fifteen heavily armed men landed and started firing.In the ensuing conflict, two policemen were killed and 8 were injured.\n\nThe Doğan News Agency reported that in Istanbul several individuals were injured after soldiers fired on a group of people attempting to cross the Bosphorus Bridge in protest of the attempted coup.\n\nOn Saturday 16 July 2016, at 00:42 EEST (UTC+3), a Turkish Black Hawk helicopter sent a distress signal and requested permission from Greek authorities for an emergency landing, and landed eight minutes later (00:50) at the Dimokritos airport in Alexandroupoli, in Greece, while two Greek F-16s observed the procedure and escorted it to the airport.The first reports said that the passengers were seven military personnel and a civilian.Later, it turned out that all were military personnel (two majors, four captains and two non-commissioned officers).They had removed the badges and insignia from their uniforms, making it impossible to know their rank.All were arrested after landing for illegal entry into the country.They were transferred to the local police station, while the Greek authorities at the airport guarded the helicopter.The eight passengers all requested political asylum in Greece as they believed they would not get a fair trial in Turkey.On 21 September 2016, Greece denied three out of the eight asylum.The men\'s lawyer Stavroula Tomara said they would be appealing the decision and said they had the ""impression that the decision has been predetermined, and that the interview was conducted just as a formality.""On 11 October 2016, four more of the eight were denied asylum.Two of the men who had previously been denied asylum applied for a re-evaluation but their applications were also rejected.\n\nAfter Erdoğan flew into Istanbul, he made a televised speech inside the airport at around 04:00, whilst thousands gathered outside.He addressed a crowd of supporters in the airport, at about 06:30 He said, ""In Turkey, armed forces are not governing the state or leading the state.They cannot.""He blamed ""those in Pennsylvania"" (a reference to Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, and his Hizmet Movement) for the coup attempt.Erdoğan also said he had plans to ""clean up"" the army, saying that ""This uprising is a gift from God to us.""State-run Anadolu Agency named former Colonel Muharrem Köse, who in March 2016 was dishonorably discharged for reported association with Gülen, as the suspected leader of the coup.However, the Alliance for Shared Values, a non-profit organization associated with Gülen, released a statement reiterating that it condemns any military intervention in domestic politics, and saying Erdoğan\'s allegations against the movement were ""highly irresponsible"".Gülen himself said in a brief statement just before midnight: ""As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nReuters reported that in early hours of 16 July, the coup appeared to have ""crumbled"" as crowds defied pro-coup military orders and gathered in major squares of Istanbul and Ankara to oppose it.Reuters also reported pro-coup soldiers surrendering to the police in Taksim Square, Istanbul.It was reported that by 05:18, Atatürk airport had completely been recaptured by the government whilst the police had surrounded the coupists inside the Turkish army headquarters, calling for them to surrender.Between 06:00–08:00 a skirmish took place there.In Akar\'s absence, Ümit Dündar, head of the First Army, was appointed Acting Chief of Staff.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning of 16 July, soldiers blocking the Bosphorus Bridge surrendered to the police.According to the government-run Anadolu Agency, this consisted of a group of 50 soldiers.Some of these soldiers were lynched by civilians despite the police\'s efforts, who fired into the air to protect the surrendering soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile, in the headquarters of the Turkish Army, 700 unarmed soldiers surrendered as the police conducted an operation into the building while 150 armed soldiers were kept inside by the police.The coupists in the TRT building in Istanbul surrendered in the early morning as well.Chief of Staff Akar, held hostage at the Akıncı Air Base in Ankara, was also rescued by pro-state forces.\n\nOne of the primary reasons that the coup failed was chaos among the plotters\' ranks.Turkey\'s National Intelligence Organization (MİT) head Hakan Fidan discovered the coup plot, and the plotters were forced to execute the coup five hours ahead of schedule.One of the main organizers, General Semih Terzi, was shot dead by loyalist Sgt.Maj.Ömer Halisdemir at the onset, demoralizing and disrupting command and control of the rebels.These two incidents resulted in the coup being carried out in an uncoordinated manner.The highest ranking staff officers opposed the coup, and publicly ordered all personnel to return to their barracks.Acting outside the military chain of command, the rebels lacked the coordination and resources to achieve their goals.The conscripted soldiers that the rebels mobilized were uninformed of their mission\'s true purpose and became demoralized.Many surrendered rather than shoot demonstrators.The commander of the First Army in Istanbul, General Ümit Dündar, personally called Erdoğan to warn him of the plot, persuading him to evacuate his hotel ahead of the plotters, and helped to secure Istanbul for Erdoğan to land.The MİT also mobilized its anti-aircraft guns, which the plotters were unaware existed, deterring rebel jets and commando teams.\n\nEqually important to the coup\'s failure, according to military strategist Edward N. Luttwak, was the inability of the rebels to neutralize Erdoğan and other high ranking government officials, either by killing or detaining them.A unit of special forces was sent via helicopter to kill or capture the president, but missed because he had been evacuated by his security detail just minutes before.Once Erdoğan landed at Atatürk International Airport (which had been recaptured from the rebels by his supporters), It became highly unlikely that the coup attempt would succeed.According to a military source, several rebel F-16s targeted Erdoğan\'s presidential jet en route to Istanbul, but they did not fire.A senior Turkish counter-terrorism official later stated that the jets did not fire because the fighter jet pilots were told by President Erdoğan\'s pilot over the radio that the (flight of the) Gulfstream IV was a Turkish Airlines flight.\n\nAccording to Naunihal Singh, author of Seizing Power, the coup attempt also failed because the plotters failed to secure control of the media and shape the narrative.Successful coups require that the rebels control the mass media.This allows even small rebel contingents to portray themselves as fully in control, and their victory as inevitable.Consequently, they convince the public, along with neutral and even loyalist soldiers, to defect to them or not resist.The rebels failed to properly broadcast their messages effectively across the media that they controlled.They failed to capture Türksat, Turkey\'s main cable and satellite communications company, and failed to gain control of the country\'s television and mobile phone networks.This allowed Erdoğan to make his Facetime call, and to speak on television.\n\nOther scholars of civil-military relations, like Drew H. Kinney, have said reports like Luttwak and Singh\'s miss the point of their own analysis: civil resistance thwarted the coup.Luttwak argues that wayward elements of the Turkish armed forces could not silence Erdoğan.Singh says that the rebels could not project success because they couldn\'t control the message.Kinney states that neither of these reasons on their own matter, but rather it\'s their effect—civil disobedience—that is important.We might find that ""[Gülen\'s movement] ...[might] have had nothing to do with the attempted takeover in July, but civilians [nevertheless] definitely played a role in thwarting the coup,"" writes Kinney.""...[A]n unhappy civilian populace mobilized to face down the military.""\n\nErdoğan wasn\'t censored (Luttwak\'s point) and was therefore able to use FaceTime to mobilize resistance, which in turn hindered the conspirators\' ability to project success (Singh\'s point).The result is civilian resistance to soldiers, i.e., people power.The reason Singh, Luttwak, and other scholars of civil-military relations miss this is, according to Kinney, because they ""usually do not study extra-military reasons for coup failures/successes,"" but rather put a premium on ""the inner-workings of the [military] operation.""In short, they blame the military for its failure rather than acknowledge the power of the masses and their successes.\n\nPro-state forces sent text messages to every Turkish citizen calling for them to protest against the coup attempt.Throughout the night sela prayers were repeatedly called from mosque minarets across the country to encourage people to resist the coup plotters.While the sela is usually called from minarets to inform the public of a funeral, they are also traditionally performed to notify of a significant event, in this case ""to rally people"".\n\nThe coup plotters initiated their operation hours ahead of the planned time when they understood that their plans had been compromised.Had the coup been launched at its original time, the middle of the night, much of the population would have been asleep.The streets would have been mostly empty.\n\nReports have emerged, neither confirmed nor denied by Russia or Turkey that the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate intercepted signals on an imminent coup passed on to loyal Turkish operatives.The intercepted plans revealed several helicopters with commandos were on the way to Marmaris\'s coastal resort, where Erdoğan stayed, capturing or killing him.Pre-warned, Erdoğan left quickly to avoid them.\n\nAn extensive purge of the Turkish civil service began in the wake of the coup attempt, with President Erdoğan warning his opponents that ""they will pay a heavy price for this.""The New York Times along with some other Western media such as The Economist, described the purges as a ""counter-coup"", with the Times expecting the president to ""become more vengeful and obsessed with control than ever, exploiting the crisis not just to punish mutinous soldiers but to further quash whatever dissent is left in Turkey,"".As of 20 July 2016, the purge already had seen over 45,000 military officials, police officers, judges, governors and civil servants arrested or suspended, including 2,700 judges, 15,000 teachers, and every university dean in the country.\n\n163 generals and admirals were detained, around 45% of the Turkish military\'s total.\n\nOn 18 July 2016, United States State Secretary John Kerry urged Turkish authorities to halt the increasing crackdown on its citizens, indicating that the crackdown was meant to ""suppress dissent.""French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault voiced concern, warning against a ""political system which turns away from democracy"" in response to the purges.\n\nOn 17 August 2016, Turkey started releasing what was expected to eventually amount to about 38,000 prison inmates, to make more space in the penal system for detainees, numbering about 35,000, who were arrested or detained after being involved in or suspected of association, with the 2016 failed coup.\n\nOn 28 September 2016, Turkish justice minister Bekir Bozdağ said 70,000 people had been processed and 32,000 were formally arrested.\n\nMajor General Cahit Bakir, who commanded Turkish forces under NATO in Afghanistan, and Brigadier General Sener Topuc, responsible for education and aid in Afghanistan, were detained by authorities in Dubai connected with the failed coup.\n\nGeneral Akın Öztürk, former Commander of the Turkish Air Force, was the Turkish military attaché to Israel.He was arrested on charges of having played a leading role in the failed coup.Öztürk has denied the charges.\n\nGeneral Adem Huduti, the commander of the Second Army, positioned along the southern borders with Syria and Iraq, and General Erdal Öztürk, the commander of the 3rd Corps, were also arrested.\n\nRear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been stationed at NATO\'s Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk, Virginia, sought asylum in the United States after being recalled by the Turkish government.\n\nIn July 2018, Istanbul\'s 25th Criminal Court sentenced 72 former soldiers involved in the coup attempt to life in prison.\n\nOn 20 June 2019, a terrorism court in Turkey sentenced 151 people to life in prison, including General Akın Öztürk, former commander of Turkish Air Force and the most senior officer involved in the coup.128 people received ""aggravated life"" sentences, which indicates harsh conditions without parole, for their role in the coup, with another 23 receiving standard life sentences.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom President Erdoğan said as one of the principal conspirators, condemned the coup attempt and denied any role in it.""I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey,"" he said in an emailed statement reported by The New York Times.""Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force.I pray to God for Turkey, Turkish citizens, and all those currently in Turkey that this situation is resolved peacefully and quickly.As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nPresident Erdoğan asked the United States to extradite Gülen: ""I call on you again, after there was a coup attempt.Extradite this man in Pennsylvania to Turkey!If we are strategic partners or model partners, do what is necessary.""Prime Minister Yildirim has threatened war against any country that would support Gülen.Turkish Labor Minister Süleyman Soylu said that ""America is behind the coup.""\n\nRegarding the AKP\'s statement against Gülen, Secretary of State Kerry invited the Turkish government ""to present us with any legitimate evidence that withstands scrutiny,"" before they would accept an extradition request.\n\nOn 15 August 2016, former United States diplomat James Jeffrey, who was the United States ambassador to Turkey from 2008 until 2010 made the following remarks: ""The Gülen movement has some infiltration at the least in the military that I am aware of.They of course had extreme infiltration into the police and judiciary earlier.I saw that when I was in Turkey previously, particularly in the Sledgehammer case, Hakan Fidan case, and the corruption cases in 2013.Obviously, significant segment of Turkey\'s bureaucracy was infiltrated and had their allegiance to a movement.That of course is absolutely unacceptable and extremely dangerous.It likely led to the coup attempt.""\n\nOutside Turkey, in Beringen, Belgium, anti-coup protesters attempted to attack a building owned by the pro-Gülen movement group \'Vuslat\'.The police brought in a water cannon to keep the attackers at bay.In news articles it was stated that the police also protected the houses of Gülen supporters.People advocated on social media to go to Beringen once more, and there was unrest in Heusden-Zolder, elsewhere in Belgium.Furthermore, in Somalia the government ordered ""the total closure of all activities"" of an organization linked to the Gülen movement, and gave its staff seven days to leave the country.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, President Erdoğan said Western countries were ""supporting terrorism"" and the military coup, saying ""I\'m calling on the United States: what kind of strategic partners are we, that you can still host someone whose extradition I have asked for?""\n\nOn 31 January 2017, British Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, Alan Duncan said he believed the Gülen movement was responsible for the coup attempt.Duncan went on saying ""the organization which incorporated itself into the state tried to topple the democratic structure in Turkey"".\n\nIn a speech on 29 July 2016, President Erdoğan said U.S. Central Command chief Joseph Votel was ""siding with coup plotters""; Erdoğan said the United States was protecting Fethullah Gülen, whom the Turkish government blames for the coup attempt.Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim made similar comments.In response, Votel said that the Turkish government\'s statements were ""unfortunate and completely inaccurate"" and expressed concern that the mass arrests and firings of military officers would damage military cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey.Similarly, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said that the Turkish military purges were impairing the fight against ISIS.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, in an escalation of tensions with the United States, Erdoğan questioned Turkey\'s relationship with the United States and criticized the West, saying that ""script"" for the abortive putsch last month was ""written abroad"".Erdoğan stated that he had personally asked Obama to extradite Gülen to Turkey.When the U.S. government replied it would need evidence of the cleric\'s guilt before extradition, to which Erdoğan said: ""When you asked for the return of a terrorist, we did not ask for documentation. ...Let us put him on trial.""\n\nYeni Şafak daily, a Turkish pro-state newspaper, stated that the former commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, now-retired United States Army General John F. Campbell, was the ""mastermind"" behind the coup attempt in Turkey.Campbell called the statement ""absolutely ridiculous"" and President Obama said ""Any reports that we had any previous knowledge of a coup attempt, that there was any U.S. involvement in it, that we were anything other than entirely supportive of Turkish democracy are completely false, unequivocally false.""\n\nOn 1 December 2017, Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for American political analyst, former CIA official and former vice chairman of US National Intelligence Council Graham Fuller, stating his involvement in the coup.A career US State Department official who was once CIA Station Chief in Kabul and later went on to be a political scientist in Rand Corporation specializing in the Middle East, Turkish authorities said Fuller attended a meeting in Istanbul on 15 July 2016 involving organization and coordination of the botched coup.Another American among the attendance, as stated by the Turkish prosecutors, was academic Henri Barkey who was named a suspect a week after the failed coup.\n\nThe U.S. consulate in Turkey issued an advisory to U.S. citizens to avoid the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey, which houses about 50 nuclear bombs, until ""normal operations have been restored"".They stated that local authorities were denying access to the air base and that power supplying the air base was shut off.\n\nThe Incirlik base is important to the U.S.-led effort in Syria to combat ISIL and other militants.Nearly 1,500 American personnel are housed in the base.\n\nTwenty-four hours after initial reports that the air base was shut down, United States defense department officials confirmed that the base and its airspace had re-opened to military aircraft and that operations by American aircraft will resume.The Turkish commander of the air base, brig.Gen. Bekir Ercan Van was arrested.After the failure of the coup Gen Bekir Ercan Van sought asylum from the U.S., but his request was denied by U.S.\n\nFollowing the failed coup attempt multiple media outlets have published editorials advocating the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Incirlik Air base as Turkey is unstable.\n\nOn 16 July, anti-coup protesters chanted against locals in areas of Istanbul with high concentration of Alevis, including Okmeydanı and Gazi.Such incidents also occurred in a quarter of Antakya with a high Alevi population, where a motorcyclist stating to be a sharia advocate was lynched.In a neighbourhood of Ankara, shops belonging to Syrians were attacked by a mob.In Malatya, Sunni Islamists harassed residents of an Alevi neighbourhood, particularly the women, and attempted to enter the neighbourhood en masse.Police intervened and blocked all roads leading there.In Kadıköy, people drinking alcohol in public were attacked by a group of religious fundamentalists.\n\nFollowing the arrests, thousands of anti-coup protesters demanded instituting the death penalty against detainees connected with the coup, chanting ""we want the death penalty"".President Erdoğan has been open to reinstituting the death penalty, noting that ""in a democracy, whatever the people want they will get.""Turkish authorities have not executed anyone since 1984, but legally abolished capital punishment only in 2004 as a pre-condition to join the European Union.\n\nEuropean Union officials have been vocal about their opposition to purges by Turkish authorities in connection to the coup.French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that Turkey must work within the framework of the law to uphold Europe\'s democratic principles.Furthermore, on 18 July 2016, Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of Foreign Affairs of the European Union, announced that no country will be admitted into the European Union ""if it introduces the death penalty"".Moreover, German press secretary, Steffen Seibert, stated that reinstituting the death penalty will end Turkey\'s accession talks with the European Union.\n\nTurkey is a member of the Council of Europe, and ratified the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) as part of its terms of membership.The ECHR is an international treaty that includes the abolition of the death penalty among its terms.As such, Turkey is legally bound not to reintroduce the death penalty.\n\nOn 20 July 2016, President Erdoğan announced a three-month state of emergency in response to the attempted coup, invoking Article 120 of the Constitution of Turkey (""Declaration of state of emergency because of widespread acts of violence and serious deterioration of public order"").Under the state of emergency, under Article 121, ""the Council of Ministers, meeting under the chairpersonship of the President of the Republic, may issue decrees having the force of law on matters necessitated by the state of emergency"", with decrees subject to subsequent parliamentary approval.The state of emergency was endorsed by the Parliament on 21 July by 346 votes to 115.The Justice and Development Party and the Nationalist Movement Party supported the state of emergency, whilst the Republican People\'s Party and the Peoples\' Democratic Party opposed it.Prime Minister Yıldırım said at the Parliament that the state of emergency was necessary to ""get rid of this scourge rapidly"".\n\nAs part of the state of emergency, deputy prime minister Kurtulmuş announced that Turkey was temporarily suspending part of the European Convention on Human Rights following the attempted coup, invoking Article 15 of the Convention (""war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation"").The suspensions must be notified to the Council of Europe and may not affect the right to a fair trial or the prohibition on torture.\n\nThis state of emergency in Turkey as well as the hindrance of the right to protest that occurred within such framework have been layered onto a longer history of emergency rules, oppressive legislation and daily government practice that have reinforced both.We can see from this the ""autocratisation"" process in Turkey has thrived of existing legal framework deeply associated in legacies of past ""emergencies"".\n\nOn 3 October 2016 Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş declared the governments intention to extend the state of emergency by a further three months raising objections from both the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) and Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) were critical of the governments use of their emergency powers and declared that they would vote against an extension.\n\nFollowing the National Security Council\'s recommendation for the extension President Erdoğan stated that it was possible that the state of emergency could last for longer than a year prompting outcry from the opposition, Leader of the Main Opposition Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu said that ""The president saying that the state of emergency can last longer than 12 months is strengthening the fear of a counter-coup"" and that it was ""raising the prospect of opportunist measures.""\n\nThe AKP\'s governmental majority allowed the three-month extension to take effect on 19 October 2016.The two-year-long state of emergency was ended on 19 July 2018.\n\nOn 16 July 2016, the media reported that eight Turkish military personnel of various ranks had landed in Greece\'s northeastern city of Alexandroupolis on board a Black Hawk helicopter and claimed political asylum in Greece.While the Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu demanded extradition of ""the eight traitors as soon as possible"", the Greek authorities stated: ""We will follow the procedures of international law.However, we give severe considerations to the fact that [the Turkish military men] are accused, in their own country, of violating the constitutional order and trying to overthrow democracy.""The helicopter was returned to Turkey shortly thereafter.The eight asylum seekers, their asylum case pending, were later transferred to Athens, mainly for safety reasons.On 26 January, the Supreme Court of Greece eventually ruled against their extradition, on the grounds that the eight were unlikely to face a fair trial if returned to their home country and due to concerns over their safety.\n\nOn 15 February 2017, five Turkish commandos illegally entered Greece through the Evros river.However, once they entered the country, the group split.The two of them surrendered to the police and on 20 February 2017, requested political asylum.They were being held in the city of Alexandroupolis.The two men belonged to the Turkish navy.The names given by the two reportedly match the names of two fugitives wanted in relation to the shadowy operation against Erdoğan himself.The Greek government mentioned that the Greek authorities will not allow the country to be dragged into the ongoing feud between the Turkish state and the followers of Gulen.But there were no sign of the other three.According to a lawyer there were indications that the other three have been arrested by Greek authorities who were about to expel them to Turkey.According to new evidence and new information these three ""arrested"" marines were delivered under fast and informal procedures from Greek to Turkish services.\n\nAfter the coup attempt, two Turkish military attachés in Athens, Staff Col. İlhan Yaşıtlı and naval attaché Col. Halis Tunç, had reportedly disappeared along with their families.The Greek foreign ministry canceled the two attachés\' accreditations on 7 August 2016, upon the request of the Turkish foreign ministry.Greek media reported that they might have fled to Italy.On 11 August 2016, the Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu confirmed the reports saying that they had left Greece for Italy on 6 August and adding that Turkey would officially ask the Italian authorities to extradite the two soldiers.\n\nOn 9 August 2016, the media reported that Turkey\'s Rear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been on a United States-based assignment for NATO and after the coup was subject to a detention order in Turkey, had sought asylum in the United States.\n\nIn mid-November 2016, it was officially confirmed that about 40 Turkish military servicemen of various ranks stationed at NATO command structures had applied for asylum in Germany and Belgium.\n\nIn January 2017, Der Spiegel magazine and ARD broadcaster reported that about 40 mostly high-ranking Turkish soldiers who worked at NATO facilities in Germany requested asylum in Germany.\n\nAt the end of February 2017, Germany said it had received 136 asylum requests from Turks holding diplomatic passports since the July coup attempt.The figure was a total for August 2016 to January 2017; some were presumed to be military officers posted to NATO bases in Germany.\n\nIn November 2016, NATO\'s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that Turkish NATO Officers had requested asylum in the countries where they had been posted.He did not name the nations involved or the number of officers, saying it was a matter for those countries to decide.He said: ""Some Turkish officers working in NATO command structure ... have requested asylum in the countries where they are working. ...As always, this is an issue that is going to be assessed and decided by the different NATO allies as a national issue.""\n\nAs of March 2017, Norway have granted asylum for four Turkish soldiers and a military attache.\n\nSeveral Turkish citizens with diplomatic passports have sought political asylum in Switzerland.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, detainees in Turkey have been denied access to legal counsel, have been beaten and tortured.They have not been provided with adequate food, water, or medical care.At least one has attempted suicide.Amnesty International wanted the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture to send people to check on detainees conditions.A person who had been on duty at the Ankara police headquarters said that police denied medical treatment to a detainee.""Let him die.We will say he came to us dead,"" the witness quoted a police doctor as saying.\n\nAlso, Erdoğan has extended the maximum period of detention for suspects from four days to 30, a move Amnesty said increased the risk of torture or other maltreatment of detainees.\n\nTurkish Justice Ministry denied the reports and the Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said on his Twitter account: ""There has not been any torture or assault of detainees in custody,"" in response to reports by Amnesty International.""The claims of torture and assault make up a pre-packaged misinformation campaign formed by members of FETÖ, one which is untrue and distorted,""\n\nOn 7 August, between three and five million people gathered for an anti-coup rally organized by the Turkish authorities in Istanbul.President Erdoğan and the two leaders of the major opposition parties (the Republican People\'s Party and the Nationalist Movement Party) were present.\n\nGreek authorities on several Aegean islands have called for emergency measures to curtail a growing flow of refugees from Turkey; the number of migrants and refugees willing to make the journey across the Aegean has increased noticeably after the failed coup.At Athens officials voiced worries because Turkish monitors overseeing the deal in Greece had been abruptly pulled out after the failed coup without being replaced.Also, the mayor of Kos expressed concern in a letter to the Greek Prime Minister citing the growing influx of refugees and migrants after the failed coup.The Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises (SETE) warned about the prospect of another flare-up in the refugee/migrant crisis due to the Turkish political instability.\n\nVincent Cochetel, the director of the Europe Bureau of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in August 2016 that parts of the EU-Turkey deal about immigration were already de facto suspended because no Turkish police were present at Greek detention centres to oversee deportations.\n\nOn 25 August 2016, seven Turkish citizens sought asylum in Greece.Two were university professors, and their two children applied for asylum in Alexandroupoli after they illegally entered the country from the northeastern border.Also, three businessmen illegally reached the Greek island of Rhodes, and they also applied for asylum.\n\nOn 30 August 2016, a Turkish judge arrived at the Greek island of Chios on a migrant boat, with six Syrian nationals, and sought asylum in the country.He told the Greek coastguard and police officers that he is being persecuted in Turkey for his political beliefs by President Tayyip Erdoğan.The Turkish judge had been arrested for illegally entering the country and was transferred to Athens for his asylum proceedings.The Syrian nationals claimed refugee status.\n\nOn 11 September 2016, four Turkish civilians were arrested by Turkish police.An academic and a teacher attempted to escape to Greece illegally by crossing the Evros river, and the other two because they organized the escape attempt.The academic and the teacher paid a total of 12,500 euros in Istanbul to arrange their escape to Greece.Before their attempt, both the academic and the teacher were suspended from their duties as part of the ongoing probe into the failed coup attempt.Police also seized an air raft, an oar and a pump while detaining the suspects.The court later ordered the two\'s release while the other two suspects, who organized the escape attempt, were arrested.\n\nOn 21 September 2016, ten Turkish civilians, two men, two women and six children landed by boat illegally on the Greek island of Rhodes and sought asylum.They told the Greek authorities they were working in the private sector in Turkey and the Turkish government was persecuting them due to their political beliefs.\n\nOn 29 September 2016, five Turkish nationals, a couple and their child and two other men, arrived in Greece, at Alexandroupolis by crossing the Evros River by boat illegally and requested political asylum.\n\nOn 12 December 2016, one female Turkish national, landed by boat, full of refugees and immigrants, illegally on the Greek island of Lesbos.She requested political asylum.\n\nOn 24 October 2017, Turkish authorities obtained information that 995 Turks have applied for asylum in Greece after the coup attempt.\n\nMore than 1,800 Turkish citizens requested asylum in Greece in 2017.\n\nOn 18 February 2018, seventeen Turkish nationals, including six children, requested asylum in Greece at Oinousses island.\n\nIn August 2018, the former lawmaker for the Peoples\' Democratic Party, Leyla Birlik, requested asylum in Greece after illegally crossing the border near Alexandroupolis.\n\nBerlin mayor, Michael Müller (SPD), said Turkey was waging war on supporters of the Gülen movement in Germany.He said that Turkish officials had approached him and asked him whether he would be prepared to confront the Gülen movement in Berlin critically and, if necessary, to support measures against it.The mayor rejected the idea and made it very clear that Turkish conflicts could not be waged in the city.\n\nDer Spiegel presented classified documents, which showed that Turkey\'s secret service (MIT) had asked Germany\'s foreign intelligence agency (BND) for help in rounding up Gülen supporters in Germany.The Turkish secret service wanted the BND to use its influence to spur German lawmakers into taking action against Gülen supporters and extraditing them to Turkey.Also, Turkey\'s government has sent German authorities requests for searches and extraditions linked to supporters of Fethullah Gülen in Germany.\n\nIn Germany businesses thought to be in support of the Gülen movement have been harassed by Erdoğan supporters.\n\nAfter the failed coup, there was a massive demonstration in Cologne at Germany, in late July, in support of Turkish President Erdoğan.Erdoğan wanted to address the participants via video but was rejected by the local authorities and the German Constitutional Court due to security concerns.Turkey said that the ban was unacceptable and a violation of freedom of expression.\n\nGerman authorities said Turkish mosques in Germany were playing Turkish politics and worried that Turkey\'s internal politics spilled over into German cities.For years, German authorities had encouraged Turkey\'s state-run religious institution Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs usually referred to as DİTİB to provide Islamic preachers and teachers and Gülen Movement Schools for the large Turkish diaspora in Germany.DİTİB manages some 900 mosques in Germany.Gülen movement runs 100 educational facilities in Germany.\n\nAfter the failed coup DİTİB published a sermon praising ""our noble nation"" for rising against ""a wretched network"" that had sown ""seeds of sedition, rebellion and hostility.""According to Volker Beck, a member of the center-left Greens in Germany\'s Bundestag, ""That was not a religious text.It was a declaration of obedience to Mr. Erdoğan and his measures since the coup attempt,"" Volker Kauder, parliamentary group leader of the Germany\'s ruling Christian Democrats, the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU)/Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) faction, said Turkish-Germans should be loyal to Germany first and foremost.\n\nGermans of Turkish origin are being pressured in Germany by informers and officers of Turkey\'s MIT spy agency.According to reports Turkey had 6,000 informants plus MIT officers in Germany who were putting pressure on ""German Turks"".Hans-Christian Ströbele said that there was an ""unbelievable"" level of ""secret activities"" in Germany by Turkey\'s MIT agency.According to Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, not even the former communist East German Stasi secret police had managed to run such a large ""army of agents"" in the former West Germany: ""Here, it\'s not just about intelligence gathering, but increasingly about intelligence service repression.""\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nGermany\'s Office for Migration and Refugees said on 18 November 2016, it had received 4,437 political asylum requests from Turkish citizens up to October, compared to 1,767 for the whole of last year.""We must expect that the number of Turks who are seeking political asylum in Germany will continue to rise,"" said Stephan Mayer, the domestic policy speaker of the union coalition in the Bundestag.\n\nOn 10 December 2016, eleven Turkish nationals, 10 adults and one child, in a martial arts group have applied for asylum in Germany.\n\nAs of January 2018, Germany was first place and Greece second as EU destinations of choice for Turkish nationals requesting asylum after the coup attempt.\n\nTurkish police have carried out simultaneous raids in 18 cities against companies associated with United States-based Fethullah Gülen.The state-run Anadolu Agency said police searched 204 premises and detained 187 businessmen for ""membership in a terror organization"" and ""providing financial support to a terror organization"".All suspects\' assets were seized.\n\nWikiLeaks released Turkish emails and documents to respond to the Turkish government\'s purges that followed the coup attempt.In turn, the Turkish Telecommunications Communications Board blocked access to the WikiLeaks website.On 17 July 2016 Wikileaks had announced on Twitter, the leak of approximately 300,000 emails and over 500,000 documents, including those to and from AKP.\n\nWikiLeaks stated that it was attacked shortly after 17 July announcement of the planned publication and hypothesized that Turkish authorities were responsible.WikiLeaks stated in a tweet, ""our infrastructure is under sustained attack.""Tweets from WikiLeaks include ""We are unsure of the true origin of the attack.The timing suggests a Turkish state power faction or its allies.We will prevail & publish.""and: ""Turks will likely be censored to prevent them reading our pending release of 100k+ docs on politics leading up to the coup."", ""We ask that Turks are ready with censorship bypassing systems such as TorBrowser and uTorrent""; ""And that everyone else is ready to help them bypass censorship and push our links through the censorship to come.""\n\nUpon the release of the email dump, it has been reported that the emails contain little to no damning information, and instead are just mails from a public mailing list, but also linked externally to ""voter information on all of the women registered to vote in 78 out of Turkey\'s 81 provinces"".\n\nSeveral places were renamed to commemorate the failed coup: Boğaziçi Köprüsü (Bosphorus Bridge) → 15 Temmuz Şehitler Köprüsü Kızılay Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Kızılay Demokrasi Meydanı Ahmet Taner Kışlalı Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Milli İrade Meydanı (Reverted to original name a few days later) Büyük İstanbul Otogarı → İstanbul 15 Temmuz Demokrasi Otogarı In TRT, Yeni Haber Stüdyosu → 15 Temmuz Millet Stüdyosu Kazan → Kahramankazan about the province\'s local people\'s resistance to the coup plotters.Kahraman means ""hero"" in Turkish Niğde University → Niğde Ömer Halisdemir University\n\nIn 2018, the Istanbul Municipal Council decided to change the names of a total of 90 streets that included words which could be associated with FETÖ.\n\nThe Presidency of Religious Affairs stated that it would not be providing religious funeral services to the dead coupists, except for ""privates and low-ranking officers compelled by force and threats who found themselves in the midst of the conflict without full knowledge of anything"".\n\nA document dated 26 September 2016 showed that Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) asked Turkish missions and religious representatives abroad to profile Gülen movement expatriates living in their respective foreign countries.Gülen-linked schools, businesses, foundations, associations, media outlets and others were also included in the reports.Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs has gathered intelligence via imams from 38 countries.\n\nBelgium officials said they would withdraw recognition of Diyanet mosques in the country if necessary.\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nOn 21 December 2016, the Turkish government has recalled Yusuf Acar, the religious affairs attaché of the Turkish Embassy in the Netherlands, after Dutch authorities said he was spying.Acar collected information of people who sympathize with Fethullah Gülen at Netherlands and passed it on to the Turkish authorities.The Dutch government called spying activities an ""unwanted and non-acceptable interference in the lives of Dutch citizens.""and the attaché was reportedly declared persona non grata and received a ""deportation warning"" by Dutch authorities.\n\nOn 26 January 2017, President Erdoğan, during his visit to Tanzania, asked his Tanzanian counterpart John Magufuli to take action against the network of Fethullah Gülen.\n\nIn April 2017 it was announced that President Erdoğan planned to establish a purpose-built museum dedicated to the coup events, called the ""Museum of the 15 July: Martyrs and Democracy"", to be located in Kahramankazan, a town near Ankara.Paid for by Turkish Ministry of Culture funds, it is planned to open at the end of 2018.The museum opened in December 2019\n\nAmong the Turkish opposition parties, the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) issued a statement expressing their public opposition to the coup, and the Hürriyet Daily News reported that Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bahçeli telephoned Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım to express his opposition to the coup.The co-chairs of the opposition Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) issued a statement saying that the party was ""under all circumstances and as a matter of principle against all kinds of coup.""Amongst the minor parties, left-wing nationalist Patriotic Party\'s Doğu Perinçek backed democracy, when he held Gülen and the Americans responsible.Kurdish militant separatist organization Kurdistan Workers\' Party, which Turkey and its allies label as a terrorist organization, urged their supporters to stay away from the coup and rather defend their people, while the Communist Party called upon the people to overthrow the AKP government which they called an ""enemy of humanity"".\n\nDuring the first hours of the coup plotters\' moves of blocking Istanbul\'s bridges and flying fighter jets low over Istanbul and Ankara, Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjørn Jagland tweeted against the coup attempt and underlined that ""any attempt to overthrow the democratically elected leaders is unacceptable"".\n\nRussia\'s President Vladimir Putin called Erdoğan out of solidarity before all NATO member countries\' heads following the coup attempt.Erdoğan thanked the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev – who was the first president to show solidarity after the coup attempt – for his support in solving the 7-month crisis over downed Russian Sukhoi Su-24 and the Prime Minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, who was among the first NATO country leaders to condemn the coup attempt, already from the early hours of Saturday.\n\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the then prime minister of Pakistan, was all praise for the people of Turkey and the AKP government and strongly condemned what he termed as an attempt to undermine democracy in Turkey.""We deeply admire the resolve of the brave and resilient Turkish people, who stood up against the forces of darkness and anarchy to express their support and commitment to democracy,"" the PM said in a statement issued from his office.\n\nThe majority of countries either expressed their support for the government or called for restraint.On 16 July 2016, however, a proposed United Nations Security Council statement denouncing the coup was not accepted by Egypt, a non-permanent member of the Council at the time, due to textual disagreements.Egyptian diplomats said that the council is ""in no position to qualify, or label [the Turkish] government – or any other government for that matter – as democratically elected or not"".Objection by the United States and the UK – permanent members of the Security Council – led to Egypt proposing a new statement calling for all sides to ""respect the democratic and constitutional principles and the rule of law"", which was rejected, preventing the condemnation of the coup attempt by the Security Council.The leader of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky supported the coup attempt.\n\nAl-Monitor reported that ""Unlike Ankara\'s Western allies, Iran did not wait for the coup\'s failure to speak up.Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif voiced support for democracy in a Twitter message in the early hours of the unrest, writing ""Stability, and democracy in Turkey are paramount"".In a subsequent phone call after the failure of the coup attempt, President Hassan Rouhani told Erdoğan the coup attempt was ""a test to identify your domestic and foreign friends and enemies.""An Iranian official pointed out parallels between the coup attempt in Turkey and the coup against Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mussadiq in 1953: ""What we know is that this attempt was triggered by foreign hands.We have experienced the same thing in the past.Since Mr. Erdogan wants to play a more positive path in the region today, they want to overthrow him.""\n\nMustafa Akıncı, President of Northern Cyprus, welcomed the fact that ""no community in Turkey ... applauded the coup as they have done in the past.""Azerbaijan strongly condemned the attempted military coup in Turkey and considered such actions unacceptable according to a statement from Novruz Mammadov, deputy head of the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration and chief of the foreign relations department.\n\nEuropean Commissioner dealing with Turkey\'s EU membership bid, Johannes Hahn, said it appears Turkey\'s government prepared arrest lists of political opponents before the coup attempt and had been waiting for the right time to act.In this sense, EU reported that as a main criticism to put this issue in the category of terrorism become the violation of the fundamental rights and fundamental values of the citizens.Hence, it underlines a total divergence of opinions and mentality between EU and Turkey which reached a deadlock here especially after the 15th of July in 2016.\n\nOn 19 July 2016, White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said during a press briefing that President Barack Obama has held a phone conversation with President Erdoğan: ""The President used the phone call to reiterate once again the strong commitment of the United States to the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey.The President pledged any needed assistance to the Turkish government as they conduct an investigation to determine exactly what happened.""\n\nOn 20 July 2016, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""Turkey has a large armed force, professional armed forces and ...I am certain they will continue as a committed and strong NATO ally.""On a statement released on 10 August 2016, the Secretary General once more strongly condemned the attempted coup and reiterated full support for Turkey\'s democratic institutions.He also expressed support for the elected Turkish government and respect for the courage of the Turkish people for resisting the coup plotters.\n\nOn 29 July 2016, the commander of U.S. Central Command, General Joseph Votel, denied statements by Turkey\'s president Erdoğan that he has supported the coup attempt in Turkey.\n\nOn 1 August 2016, United States Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, General Joseph Dunford, visited Turkey and condemned the coup attempt.Dunford said: ""The consistent theme throughout the day was a reaffirmation of the importance of the U.S.-Turkey relationship – the need for us to cooperate.""\n\nOn July, 20, there were reports that a group of Turkish military commandos coup fugitives would try to cross from Turkey to the island of Symi, in the southeastern Aegean, at Greece.The Hellenic Coast Guard was on alert and increased the patrols in the area, especially after a group of inflatable dinghies and other vessels were seen departing from Datça, on the Turkish coast, in the direction of Symi, they monitored the movements of the Turkish vessels, which remained in Turkish waters.Furthermore, a contingent of the Hellenic Police was dispatched to Symi to conduct checks there.The Greek government had been anticipating a possible attempt by participants in the failed coup to come to Greece and took the reports seriously.Turkish F-16 fighter jets were also scrambled to check reports that missing Turkish coast guard vessels had appeared in Greek waters in the Aegean.Later on the day, the Turkish interior ministry denied reports that rebel soldiers might have ""hijacked"" a vessel to flee to Greece.The Greek armed forces remained on alert the throughout the day for potential coup fugitives.\n\nAccording to Michael Rubin, from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Erdoğan had himself to blame for the coup.Following an increasingly Islamist agenda, Erdoğan had reportedly ""dropped any pretense of governing for all Turks.""After ""fanning the flames"" at the 2013 Gezi Park protests, he transformed the predominantly Kurdish-inhabited areas of southeastern Turkey ""into a war zone reminiscent of the worst days of the 1980s.""The biggest problem, according to Rubin, might have been Erdoğan\'s foreign policy, which managed to turn the initial ""no problems with neighbors"" doctrine into a situation where the country has problems with almost every neighbor and has even alienated some of its allies and friends.Rubin previously worked as an official at the Pentagon and less than 4 months before the coup, he wrote an article in Newsweek magazine titled, ""Will There Be a Coup Against Erdogan in Turkey?""\n\nBritish Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk warned that ""too late did Erdoğan realize the cost of the role he had chosen for his country.It\'s one thing to say sorry to Putin and patch up relations with Netanyahu; but when you can no longer trust your army, there are more serious matters to concentrate upon.""Even if this coup may have failed, Fisk expected another to follow in the months or years to come.\n\nTurkish professor Akın Ünver described the coup d\'état attempt as ""more of a mutiny"".\n\nThe name of the ""Peace at Home Council"" – Yurtta Sulh Konseyi – is derived from Atatürk\'s famous saying \'Peace at Home, Peace in the World\'.Journalist Ezgi Başaran said that ""the statement of the junta, that was [...] read on the [...] government TV [channel] as the coup got under way, bore a strong resemblance to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk\'s famous address to the Turkish Youth.[...] On the other hand, given that these references are too obvious, they may have been intentionally included to insinuate a Kemalist junta rather than a Gülenist one.""\n\nThe citizen journalism site Bellingcat published an analysis of the messages of a WhatsApp group consisting of high-ranking military officials who had taken part in the coup covering their activities including them killing several people.The messages were cross referenced with video footage.The group was named ""Yurtta sulh"" which refers to a peace at home speech and they seem secular and military with no references to Gülen or anything related during the several hours of messaging.\n\nNews reports have suggested that the coup ringleader was Adil Öksüz.Some believe Öksüz to have been an operative with Turkish intelligence.\n\nGerman Islamic studies scholar said the putschists tried to forestall a large-scale purge of judiciary and military, the implementation of which had already started on Saturday, the day after the coup attempt.According to Turkish investigative journalist Ahmet Şık, a list of officials to be purged had been ready compiled by the attorney-general of Izmir, Okan Bato, and was approved by President Erdoğan.According to this version, the putschists had to quickly bring forward their coup attempt before being disposed and arrested.\n\nDuring and after the events, several politicians and commentators suggested that the government knew about the coup in advance and possibly directed it.The facts that the coup attempt began in the evening rather than at a more inconspicuous time and that the events were largely confined to Ankara and Istanbul contributed to doubts about the authenticity of the coup attempt.Journalists and opposition politicians branded it a \'tragic comedy\' and \'theatre play\'.Advocates of such theories pointed to how Erdoğan stood to gain from the coup attempt in terms of increasing his popularity and support for his calls for an executive presidency, while being able to legitimize further crackdowns on judicial independence and the opposition in general.\n\nOther elements that were reported to support the theory included: no list of demands by the coup plotters, the organization and response of the police, the long lists of arrests that seemed to be ready surprisingly quickly (including arrests of 2,745 judges and 2,839 soldiers), and the obvious nature of the coup actions.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom Erdoğan had said as being one of the principal conspirators, commented, ""I don\'t believe that the world believes the accusations made by President Erdoğan.There is a possibility that it could be a staged coup and it could be meant for further accusations [against the Gülenists].""Journalist Cengiz Çandar, a veteran observer of Turkey\'s coups, said ""I have never seen any with this magnitude of such inexplicable sloppiness.""Prominent Hizmet (Gülen movement) spokesman Alp Aslandogan said, referencing that the Turkish Air Force commander met with Erdoğan before 15 July, that certain legal documentation related to the coup seemed written beforehand, arguing that within ""the indictment written by a prosecutor on the night of 15 July to 16 July, there were events there that didn\'t actually happen.Some events did happen, but those events didn\'t happen by the time the document started.It looks like a bigger plan was there, and part of the plan did not come to pass.""\n\nThe organization and spontaneous synchronization by large numbers of mosques was perceived to be unachievable unless there had been prior preparation, with journalists also pointing to how Erdoğan could have strategically used the call to prayer to invoke religious sentiment in a political situation as a veiled attack on state secularism.\n\nThousands of arrests and purges were conducted by Turkish authorities between 16 and 18 July 2016.The sheer number of these arrests made at such a speed could only be done so if the ""Turkish government had all those lists ready"", as suggested by Johannes Hahn, European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, on 18 July 2016.Hahn also said that because these lists were already available immediately after the coup, the ""event was prepared"" and the lists were to be used ""at a certain stage"".\n\nMehmet Dişli, who was seen giving orders to the coup plotters and who was the one who put a belt around Hulusi Akar\'s neck to make him sign, is the brother of Şaban Dişli, a former vice president of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and confidant of Erdoğan.\n\nSeveral social media users have compared the coup attempt to the Reichstag fire in 1933, which Adolf Hitler used as an excuse to suspend civil liberties and order mass arrests of his opponents.Politico correspondent Ryan Heath said that ""the coup was staged to allow Erdoğan to purge the military of opponents and increase his grip on the country"".Heath used Twitter to share comments from his Turkish source, who called the events of Friday night a ""fake coup"" which would help a ""fake democracy warrior"" (referring to Erdoğan).The source said: ""Probably we\'ll see an early election [in] which he\'ll try to guarantee an unbelievable majority of the votes.And this will probably guarantee another 10–15 years of authoritarian, elected dictatorship.""\n\nThe New York Times reported that some Turkish citizens believed the coup attempt was staged by Erdoğan to improve his public image and popularity, while cracking down on political opponents and expanding his power.Critics found it suspect that reportedly no government officials were arrested or harmed during the attempted coup, which—among other factors—raised the suspicion of a false flag event staged by the Turkish government to crack down on opposition parties.Those in Turkey suggesting that the coup was staged are also being questioned by the government.\n\nPoliticians and journalists who were skeptical of the authenticity of the coup plot said that in reality, a \'civil coup\' had effectively been staged against the Armed Forces and Judiciary, both of which were extensively purged of stated Gülen supporters by the government shortly after the events.Skeptics said that the coup would be used as an excuse for further erosion of judicial independence and a crackdown on the opposition, giving the AKP greater and unstoppable power over all state institutions and paving the way for a more radical Islamist agenda at odds with the founding principles of the Turkish Republic.\n\nJustice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said in late July 2016 that Turkish social media users who said the government was staging the coup faced investigation: ""Just look at the people who are saying on social media that this was theatre.Public prosecutors are already investigating them.Most of them are losers who think it is an honor to die for Fethullah Gülen\'s command.""\n\nOn 12 July 2017, Stockholm Center for Freedom, a monitoring group with reported links to the Gülen movement, published a controversial report stating that President Erdogan orchestrated the coup bid as a false flag to consolidate his powers, set up his opposition for a mass persecution, and push Turkish Armed Forces into a military incursion into Syria.According to the report, it uncovered new evidence from 11 July 2016, four days before the planned coup bid, that a secret plan was circulated among select group of Armed Forces to give an appearance of a coup attempt.The plan was sanctioned by intelligence and military chiefs with the approval of Erdogan.\n\nIn early November 2017, Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for , former Director of the Middle East Program of the Woodrow

109,"{'Wiki_Title': '2016 Turkish coup attempt', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'On 15 July 2016, a faction within the Turkish Armed Forces, organized as the Peace at Home Council, attempted a coup d\'état against state institutions, including the government and president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.They attempted to seize control of several places in Ankara, Istanbul, Marmaris and elsewhere, such as the Asian side entrance of the Bosphorus Bridge, but failed to do so after forces and civilians loyal to the state defeated them.The Council cited an erosion of secularism, elimination of democratic rule, disregard for human rights, and Turkey\'s loss of credibility in the international arena as reasons for the coup.The government said it had evidence the coup leaders were linked to the Gülen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the Republic of Turkey and led by Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish businessman and a well-known Islamic scholar who lives in exile in Pennsylvania.The Turkish government alleged that Gülen was behind the coup (which Gülen denied) and that the United States was harboring him.Events surrounding the coup attempt and the purges in its aftermath reflect a complex power struggle between Islamist elites in Turkey.\n\nDuring the coup attempt, over 300 people were killed and more than 2,100 were injured.Many government buildings, including the Turkish Parliament and the Presidential Palace, were bombed from the air.Mass arrests followed, with at least 40,000 detained, including at least 10,000 soldiers and 2,745 judges, for being affiliated with the coup attempt.15,000 education staff were also suspended and the licenses of 21,000 teachers working at private institutions were revoked after the government stated they were loyal to Gülen.More than 77,000 people have been arrested and over 160,000 fired from their jobs, on reports of connections to Gülen.\n\nThere were many reactions against the coup attempt, both domestically and internationally.The main opposition parties in Turkey condemned the attempt, while several international leaders—such as those of the United States, NATO, the European Union, and neighboring countries—called for ""respect of the democratic institutions in Turkey and its elected officials.""Many international organizations also opposed the coup.The United Nations Security Council, however, did not denounce the coup after disagreements over the phrasing of a statement.Iran opposed the coup and advised Erdogan to defeat the coup plotters.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the head of United States Central Command, General Joseph Votel, was ""siding with coup plotters"", after Votel criticized the Turkish government for arresting the Pentagon\'s contacts in Turkey.\n\nIn March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.The same month, the British Parliament\'s Foreign Affairs Select Committee said some Gulenists were involved in the coup d\'état attempt but found no hard evidence that Fethullah Gülen masterminded the failed coup and found no evidence to justify the United Kingdom designating the Gülen movement as a ""terrorist organization"".\n\nSince the 1970s, followers of the influential cleric Fethullah Gülen had assumed increasingly important positions within the Turkish state apparatus.Gülen several times advised his followers to take key positions in society and government, if necessary with a secret identity to avoid opposition from the laicistic Turkish army and government.Nevertheless, at the start of the 21st century, Gülen\'s followers achieved crucial positions of power in Turkey (and beyond) with a vast network of newspapers, TV channels, schools, associations, lobby organizations, financial institutions and positions within the state such as the army and the judiciary.Initially, the then Prime Minister Erdogan seemingly tolerated the power of the Gülen movement because of common interests such as limiting the undemocratic political power of the military, but also because of impotence and fear of Gülen\'s power within Turkey.\n\nA series of events eventually led to a rift between Erdogan and Gülen.For example, prosecutors that allegedly were aligned with the Gülen movement tried to arrest the intelligence chief Hakan Fidan for the peace negotiations with the PKK, and by extension PM Erdogan subsequently, as the Turkish secret service is directly subordinate to the prime minister of Turkey.During this period (2010-2013), state secrets were leaked, fraud was committed with the entrance exams for government employees (KPSS), a change of power occurred at the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) and (sex)tapes of both government members and opposition members were leaked.Following these events and other incidents, the Turkish government decided to designate the Gülen movement as parallel state and FETÖ (Fethullahist Terror Organization).Alleged Gülen supporters were fired or arrested.The coup attempt that followed is therefore also described by some analysts as a last desperate attempt by Gülenists to retain power.\n\nIt is widely reported that Kemalist ideology played a huge role in motivating the 15 July 2016 coup attempt, like all previous political interventions in the history of Turkey\'s military coups.Since the establishment of multiparty democracy in Turkey in 1946, the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), together with the judiciary, have viewed themselves as guardians of Kemalist ideals and the secular Turkish nationalist state established under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk against political parties that have promoted a larger role for Islam and minorities in public life.The military and judiciary have regularly intervened in politics to block or ban popular parties representing conservative Muslim Turks, attempting to relax the restrictions on traditional religious practices, such as women\'s wearing of headscarves.The military has toppled four elected governments: by coups in 1960 and 1980, and by military decisions in 1971 and 1997.The military has also banned several major political parties.In 1998, Erdoğan, then-mayor of Istanbul, was banned for life from politics and jailed because he had read a religious poem by Ziya Gökalp several years before, at a public meeting.In 2007, the military expressed its opposition to the election of Abdullah Gül, of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), as president, by issuing an e-memorandum.Still, Gül was eventually elected when the AKP won both a referendum on the matter.Also, a snap election, and the party returned with a larger majority in the parliament.The military cited erosion of secularism as one of the reasons for the coup in the statement published on the day of the coup.\n\nAs opposed to previous political interventions by the Turkish military, Turkey\'s AKP government and pro-state media maintain that the 15 July 2016 coup attempt was not motivated by allegiance to Kemalist ideology, but rather to the vast political, economic, and religious network led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen.Between 2007 and 2012, high-profile Kemalists, including high-ranking officers of the Turkish Armed Forces, faced a series of trials and purges, under reports of involvement in a secret society codenamed ""Ergenekon.""Supported by Islamist (both pro-Gülen and pro-Erdoğan) prosecutors, security officials, and media, the purges allowed lower-rank Islamist officers to assume high-ranking military positions.They were seen as a bid by Turkey\'s civilian leaders under President Erdoğan to establish dominance over the military.In these trials in 2013 – viewed as ""sensational"" and ""one of the biggest in recent Turkish history"" – 275 people, including senior military officers, journalists, lawyers, and academics, were said to be involved in the so-called ""Ergenekon"" conspiracy, reportedly plotting a coup in 2003/04 against then–Prime Minister Erdoğan.Additionally, some military officers were said to be involved in a separate reported plot, Sledgehammer.Simultaneously, Erdoğan promoted lower-ranking officers up the chain of command, ensuring that the military chief of staff was loyal to him and thereby demoralizing the army.\n\nThe AKP\'s alliance with Gülen started to collapse during 2013 as Gülenists targeted the AKP using corruption charges.After the split, Erdoğan decided it would be advantageous to rehabilitate the army.The ""Ergenekon"" convictions were overturned in April 2016 by the Court of Cassation, which ruled that the existence of the network was unproven.\n\nIn 2013, law enforcement efforts to fight corruption, which had led to the 2013 corruption scandal in Turkey, were faulted by Erdoğan.The anti-corruption efforts were a source of tension between the Gülenists and the AKP.In political analysis in the months prior to the coup attempt, the incidence of corruption was reported to be ""rife"" in Turkey.Following the coup attempt, some coup leaders cited corruption as a reason for their actions.\n\nOn 13 July, less than two days before the coup was launched, Erdoğan signed a bill giving Turkish soldiers immunity from prosecution while taking part in domestic operations.The bill requires cases against commanders to be approved by the prime minister, while district governors may sign cases against lower-ranking soldiers.The immunity bill was seen as part of the détente between the government and the armed forces.The latter has increasingly been taking over military operations in Kurdish-inhabited areas from police and paramilitary units.\n\nOn 15 July 2016, as reported just before 23:00 EEST (UTC+3), military jets were spotted flying over Ankara, and both the Fatih Sultan Mehmet and Bosphorus bridges in Istanbul were closed.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said military action was being ""taken outside the chain of command"" and it was an ""illegal attempt"" to seize power by ""part of the military"".He further said that those involved ""will pay the highest price.""Local media also reported tanks in Istanbul\'s Atatürk Airport.It was reported that Internet users within Turkey were blocked from accessing Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.Twitter later stated that it had ""no reason to think we\'ve been fully blocked"".Some hostages were taken at military headquarters, including the Turkish Chief of the General Staff Hulusi Akar.At around 21:00, the coupists had invited Salih Zeki Çolak, the commander of the Turkish Land Forces to the military headquarters.When he arrived, he was immediately apprehended.Abidin Ünal, head of the Turkish Air Force, who had been attending a wedding in Istanbul, was abducted from there by soldiers who descended from a helicopter.The coupists then tried to force Akar to sign the coup declaration, almost strangling him using a belt in the process.He refused and was then taken to the Akıncı Air Base and other commanders at the headquarters.The military also entered the Justice and Development Party\'s offices in Istanbul and asked people to leave.\n\nEarly reports said President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was safe in Marmaris, south-west Turkey, where he had been on holiday.\n\nFrom around 23:00 to midnight, helicopters bombed the police special forces headquarters and police air force headquarters in Gölbaşı, just outside of Ankara.The attacks left 42 dead and 43 injured.Türksat headquarters in Gölbaşı was also attacked, killing two security personnel.\n\nAt around 23:50, soldiers occupied Taksim Square in central Istanbul.\n\nAt 00:02, it was reported by Reuters that soldiers were inside the buildings of the state broadcaster, the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), in Ankara.During the coup attempt, soldiers forced anchor Tijen Karaş to read out a statement saying that ""the democratic and secular rule of law has been eroded by the current government"" and that Turkey was now led by the Peace at Home Council who would ""ensure the safety of the population.""The statement read in part: ""Turkish Armed Forces have completely taken over the administration of the country to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedoms, the rule of law and general security that was damaged.[...] All international agreements are still valid.We hope that all of our good relationships with all countries will continue.""The plotters said they had ""done so to preserve democratic order, and that the rule of law must remain a priority"".The statement also ordered temporary martial law (sıkıyönetim), and said a new constitution would be prepared ""as soon as possible"".TRT was then taken off air.\n\nOther media outlets were also raided by the putschists, such as Turkish newspaper Hürriyet and private broadcaster CNN Türk.\n\nReuters reported on 15 July that an EU source described the coup as ""well orchestrated,"" and predicted that ""given the scale of the operation, it is difficult to imagine they will stop short of prevailing.""Another EU diplomat said that the Turkish ambassador in his capital was shocked and ""taking it very seriously"".\n\nThe Peace at Home Council was reportedly chaired by Muharrem Köse.\n\nAdana: Upon receiving the intelligence that thirty soldiers from the 10th Air Base Command would move to the base where the regional and provincial gendarmerie commands were located, the police prevented the soldiers from leaving the guardhouse with TOMA and armored vehicles and blocked them.Bitlis: In the Tatvan district of Bitlis, on the orders of Brigade Commander Arif Seddar Afşar, helicopters were circulated in the skies of Tatvan and fired at the city.The brigade command left the municipality\'s construction equipment in front of the barracks in case there was a tank operation in the district.Denizli: Approximately five hundred officers and non-commissioned officers who participated in the coup attempt surrendered to the gendarmerie and police forces.They were interrogated at Çardak District Gendarme Command.Kars: With the order of Kars 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, the soldiers who came with tanks and armored personnel carriers surrounded the Police Headquarters building and wanted to detain Faruk Karaduman, the chief of police.At the same hours, the invitation of Deputy Governors, 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, went to the command.Kocaeli: Turkcell\'s data center in Gebze was raided by soldiers who participated in the coup attempt.Soldiers who tried to interrupt the internet service were detained.Malatya: A rebellious soldier opened fire inside a base of the Turkish 2nd Army, damaging six vehicles.The base was besieged by police and loyal soldiers, and the shooter was captured.Marmaris: Three military helicopters carried out a bomb attack on the hotel where Erdoğan was staying.Forty rebellious soldiers of the Special Forces Command clashed with the police in the region.Mersin: Mersin Garrison and Mediterranean Region Commander Admiral Nejat Atilla Demirhan called Mersin Provincial Police Deputy Chief Yakup Usta and Gendarmerie Colonel Mustafa Bakçepınar and stated that the Turkish Armed Forces had taken over the administration.He introduced himself as the martial law garrison commander and ordered Mersin Governor Özdemir Çakacak and district governors to be taken into custody.Demirhan and Dağdelen, who made the same announcement with the police radio obtained from Mersin Police Department, were detained through the operation of the security forces.Sakarya: Sakarya Governorship was captured with armored personnel carriers, military trucks and many military jeeps from the military unit in the Kandıra district of Kocaeli.As a reinforcement, two military vehicles full of soldiers from the Sakarya central division command had to return to their barracks in the face of the resistance of the police and the harsh reaction of the people who took to the streets against the putschists.The vehicles occupying the Sakarya Governorate were seized by the citizens and the soldiers in them were neutralized and handed over to the security forces.Afterwards, citizens and security forces entered the governor\'s office and neutralized the soldiers there and suppressed the uprising in the province.Eight civilian citizens were injured as a result of the fire opened by the military during the incident.Şırnak: Çakırsöğüt Gendarmerie Commando Brigadier General Ali Osman Gürcan and 309 soldiers, that participated in the coup attempt, were detained by the security forces.\n\nTurkey\'s Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım responded to the events by stating that an ""illegal action is taking place outside of the chain of command"".He also said that ""the government elected by the people remains in charge and this government will only go when the people say so.""The Turkish Presidential office said President Erdoğan was on holiday inside Turkey and condemned the coup attempt as an attack on democracy.A presidential source also said Erdoğan and his government were still in power.The first messages from Erdoğan were transmitted at around 00:23At about 01:00, Erdoğan did a FaceTime interview with CNN Türk, in which he called upon his supporters to take to the streets in defiance of the military-imposed curfew, saying ""There is no power higher than the power of the people.Let them do what they will at the public squares and airports.""Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş appeared on live television, saying Turkey\'s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is still in charge of the government.The mayor of Ankara, Melih Gökçek of the AKP, encouraged people to go out to the city\'s streets in defiance, despite a curfew imposed by the military.Erdoğan\'s plane took off from Dalaman Airport near Marmaris at 23:47, but had to wait in the air south of Atatürk for the airport to be secured.His plane landed at 02:50\n\nThe First Army General Command in Istanbul stated in a news conference that the TSK did not support the coup and the perpetrators represented a tiny faction that were on the verge of being brought under control.Istanbul Atatürk Airport was closed; all flights from the airport were cancelled.There was an explosion in the TRT broadcasting headquarters and gunfire was reported in Ankara.Soon after, it was stormed by a crowd of civilians and police, with four soldiers inside reportedly being ""neutralized"".The channel went back on air and Karaş, who had previously announced the coup, said live that she had been held hostage and forced to read the declaration of the coup at gunpoint.\n\nBy 01:00, it was reported that the military had pulled its forces from the Atatürk airport and people were coming inside, but by 01:13, it was reported that tanks were inside the airport and gunfire was heard.\n\nTanks opened fire near the Turkish Parliament Building.The parliamentary building was also hit from the air.Injuries were reported among protesters following gunfire on Bosphorus Bridge.\n\nA helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was shot down by a Turkish military F-16 fighter jet.There were also reports of pro-state jets flying over Ankara to ""neutralize"" helicopters used by those behind the coup.\n\nAt 03:08, a military helicopter opened fire on the Turkish parliament.At 03:10, Turkish Armed Forces stated on their website that they had complete control over the country.At 03:12, Yıldırım made a statement saying that the situation was under control and that a no-fly zone was declared over Ankara and that military planes that still flew would be shot down.\n\nIt was reported that the Turkish parliament had been bombed again at 03:23 and 03:33.A helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was also seen flying by it.Half an hour following the report of 12 deaths and 2 injuries in the parliament, soldiers entered CNN Türk\'s headquarters and forced the studio to go off air.After an hour of interruption by the pro-coup soldiers, CNN Türk resumed its broadcast.Later, İsmail Kahraman said a bomb exploded at a corner of the public relations building inside the parliament, with no deaths but several injuries among police officers.\n\nAt around 04:00 two or three helicopters attacked Erdogan\'s hotel.According to eyewitness accounts, ten to fifteen heavily armed men landed and started firing.In the ensuing conflict, two policemen were killed and 8 were injured.\n\nThe Doğan News Agency reported that in Istanbul several individuals were injured after soldiers fired on a group of people attempting to cross the Bosphorus Bridge in protest of the attempted coup.\n\nOn Saturday 16 July 2016, at 00:42 EEST (UTC+3), a Turkish Black Hawk helicopter sent a distress signal and requested permission from Greek authorities for an emergency landing, and landed eight minutes later (00:50) at the Dimokritos airport in Alexandroupoli, in Greece, while two Greek F-16s observed the procedure and escorted it to the airport.The first reports said that the passengers were seven military personnel and a civilian.Later, it turned out that all were military personnel (two majors, four captains and two non-commissioned officers).They had removed the badges and insignia from their uniforms, making it impossible to know their rank.All were arrested after landing for illegal entry into the country.They were transferred to the local police station, while the Greek authorities at the airport guarded the helicopter.The eight passengers all requested political asylum in Greece as they believed they would not get a fair trial in Turkey.On 21 September 2016, Greece denied three out of the eight asylum.The men\'s lawyer Stavroula Tomara said they would be appealing the decision and said they had the ""impression that the decision has been predetermined, and that the interview was conducted just as a formality.""On 11 October 2016, four more of the eight were denied asylum.Two of the men who had previously been denied asylum applied for a re-evaluation but their applications were also rejected.\n\nAfter Erdoğan flew into Istanbul, he made a televised speech inside the airport at around 04:00, whilst thousands gathered outside.He addressed a crowd of supporters in the airport, at about 06:30 He said, ""In Turkey, armed forces are not governing the state or leading the state.They cannot.""He blamed ""those in Pennsylvania"" (a reference to Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, and his Hizmet Movement) for the coup attempt.Erdoğan also said he had plans to ""clean up"" the army, saying that ""This uprising is a gift from God to us.""State-run Anadolu Agency named former Colonel Muharrem Köse, who in March 2016 was dishonorably discharged for reported association with Gülen, as the suspected leader of the coup.However, the Alliance for Shared Values, a non-profit organization associated with Gülen, released a statement reiterating that it condemns any military intervention in domestic politics, and saying Erdoğan\'s allegations against the movement were ""highly irresponsible"".Gülen himself said in a brief statement just before midnight: ""As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nReuters reported that in early hours of 16 July, the coup appeared to have ""crumbled"" as crowds defied pro-coup military orders and gathered in major squares of Istanbul and Ankara to oppose it.Reuters also reported pro-coup soldiers surrendering to the police in Taksim Square, Istanbul.It was reported that by 05:18, Atatürk airport had completely been recaptured by the government whilst the police had surrounded the coupists inside the Turkish army headquarters, calling for them to surrender.Between 06:00–08:00 a skirmish took place there.In Akar\'s absence, Ümit Dündar, head of the First Army, was appointed Acting Chief of Staff.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning of 16 July, soldiers blocking the Bosphorus Bridge surrendered to the police.According to the government-run Anadolu Agency, this consisted of a group of 50 soldiers.Some of these soldiers were lynched by civilians despite the police\'s efforts, who fired into the air to protect the surrendering soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile, in the headquarters of the Turkish Army, 700 unarmed soldiers surrendered as the police conducted an operation into the building while 150 armed soldiers were kept inside by the police.The coupists in the TRT building in Istanbul surrendered in the early morning as well.Chief of Staff Akar, held hostage at the Akıncı Air Base in Ankara, was also rescued by pro-state forces.\n\nOne of the primary reasons that the coup failed was chaos among the plotters\' ranks.Turkey\'s National Intelligence Organization (MİT) head Hakan Fidan discovered the coup plot, and the plotters were forced to execute the coup five hours ahead of schedule.One of the main organizers, General Semih Terzi, was shot dead by loyalist Sgt.Maj.Ömer Halisdemir at the onset, demoralizing and disrupting command and control of the rebels.These two incidents resulted in the coup being carried out in an uncoordinated manner.The highest ranking staff officers opposed the coup, and publicly ordered all personnel to return to their barracks.Acting outside the military chain of command, the rebels lacked the coordination and resources to achieve their goals.The conscripted soldiers that the rebels mobilized were uninformed of their mission\'s true purpose and became demoralized.Many surrendered rather than shoot demonstrators.The commander of the First Army in Istanbul, General Ümit Dündar, personally called Erdoğan to warn him of the plot, persuading him to evacuate his hotel ahead of the plotters, and helped to secure Istanbul for Erdoğan to land.The MİT also mobilized its anti-aircraft guns, which the plotters were unaware existed, deterring rebel jets and commando teams.\n\nEqually important to the coup\'s failure, according to military strategist Edward N. Luttwak, was the inability of the rebels to neutralize Erdoğan and other high ranking government officials, either by killing or detaining them.A unit of special forces was sent via helicopter to kill or capture the president, but missed because he had been evacuated by his security detail just minutes before.Once Erdoğan landed at Atatürk International Airport (which had been recaptured from the rebels by his supporters), It became highly unlikely that the coup attempt would succeed.According to a military source, several rebel F-16s targeted Erdoğan\'s presidential jet en route to Istanbul, but they did not fire.A senior Turkish counter-terrorism official later stated that the jets did not fire because the fighter jet pilots were told by President Erdoğan\'s pilot over the radio that the (flight of the) Gulfstream IV was a Turkish Airlines flight.\n\nAccording to Naunihal Singh, author of Seizing Power, the coup attempt also failed because the plotters failed to secure control of the media and shape the narrative.Successful coups require that the rebels control the mass media.This allows even small rebel contingents to portray themselves as fully in control, and their victory as inevitable.Consequently, they convince the public, along with neutral and even loyalist soldiers, to defect to them or not resist.The rebels failed to properly broadcast their messages effectively across the media that they controlled.They failed to capture Türksat, Turkey\'s main cable and satellite communications company, and failed to gain control of the country\'s television and mobile phone networks.This allowed Erdoğan to make his Facetime call, and to speak on television.\n\nOther scholars of civil-military relations, like Drew H. Kinney, have said reports like Luttwak and Singh\'s miss the point of their own analysis: civil resistance thwarted the coup.Luttwak argues that wayward elements of the Turkish armed forces could not silence Erdoğan.Singh says that the rebels could not project success because they couldn\'t control the message.Kinney states that neither of these reasons on their own matter, but rather it\'s their effect—civil disobedience—that is important.We might find that ""[Gülen\'s movement] ...[might] have had nothing to do with the attempted takeover in July, but civilians [nevertheless] definitely played a role in thwarting the coup,"" writes Kinney.""...[A]n unhappy civilian populace mobilized to face down the military.""\n\nErdoğan wasn\'t censored (Luttwak\'s point) and was therefore able to use FaceTime to mobilize resistance, which in turn hindered the conspirators\' ability to project success (Singh\'s point).The result is civilian resistance to soldiers, i.e., people power.The reason Singh, Luttwak, and other scholars of civil-military relations miss this is, according to Kinney, because they ""usually do not study extra-military reasons for coup failures/successes,"" but rather put a premium on ""the inner-workings of the [military] operation.""In short, they blame the military for its failure rather than acknowledge the power of the masses and their successes.\n\nPro-state forces sent text messages to every Turkish citizen calling for them to protest against the coup attempt.Throughout the night sela prayers were repeatedly called from mosque minarets across the country to encourage people to resist the coup plotters.While the sela is usually called from minarets to inform the public of a funeral, they are also traditionally performed to notify of a significant event, in this case ""to rally people"".\n\nThe coup plotters initiated their operation hours ahead of the planned time when they understood that their plans had been compromised.Had the coup been launched at its original time, the middle of the night, much of the population would have been asleep.The streets would have been mostly empty.\n\nReports have emerged, neither confirmed nor denied by Russia or Turkey that the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate intercepted signals on an imminent coup passed on to loyal Turkish operatives.The intercepted plans revealed several helicopters with commandos were on the way to Marmaris\'s coastal resort, where Erdoğan stayed, capturing or killing him.Pre-warned, Erdoğan left quickly to avoid them.\n\nAn extensive purge of the Turkish civil service began in the wake of the coup attempt, with President Erdoğan warning his opponents that ""they will pay a heavy price for this.""The New York Times along with some other Western media such as The Economist, described the purges as a ""counter-coup"", with the Times expecting the president to ""become more vengeful and obsessed with control than ever, exploiting the crisis not just to punish mutinous soldiers but to further quash whatever dissent is left in Turkey,"".As of 20 July 2016, the purge already had seen over 45,000 military officials, police officers, judges, governors and civil servants arrested or suspended, including 2,700 judges, 15,000 teachers, and every university dean in the country.\n\n163 generals and admirals were detained, around 45% of the Turkish military\'s total.\n\nOn 18 July 2016, United States State Secretary John Kerry urged Turkish authorities to halt the increasing crackdown on its citizens, indicating that the crackdown was meant to ""suppress dissent.""French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault voiced concern, warning against a ""political system which turns away from democracy"" in response to the purges.\n\nOn 17 August 2016, Turkey started releasing what was expected to eventually amount to about 38,000 prison inmates, to make more space in the penal system for detainees, numbering about 35,000, who were arrested or detained after being involved in or suspected of association, with the 2016 failed coup.\n\nOn 28 September 2016, Turkish justice minister Bekir Bozdağ said 70,000 people had been processed and 32,000 were formally arrested.\n\nMajor General Cahit Bakir, who commanded Turkish forces under NATO in Afghanistan, and Brigadier General Sener Topuc, responsible for education and aid in Afghanistan, were detained by authorities in Dubai connected with the failed coup.\n\nGeneral Akın Öztürk, former Commander of the Turkish Air Force, was the Turkish military attaché to Israel.He was arrested on charges of having played a leading role in the failed coup.Öztürk has denied the charges.\n\nGeneral Adem Huduti, the commander of the Second Army, positioned along the southern borders with Syria and Iraq, and General Erdal Öztürk, the commander of the 3rd Corps, were also arrested.\n\nRear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been stationed at NATO\'s Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk, Virginia, sought asylum in the United States after being recalled by the Turkish government.\n\nIn July 2018, Istanbul\'s 25th Criminal Court sentenced 72 former soldiers involved in the coup attempt to life in prison.\n\nOn 20 June 2019, a terrorism court in Turkey sentenced 151 people to life in prison, including General Akın Öztürk, former commander of Turkish Air Force and the most senior officer involved in the coup.128 people received ""aggravated life"" sentences, which indicates harsh conditions without parole, for their role in the coup, with another 23 receiving standard life sentences.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom President Erdoğan said as one of the principal conspirators, condemned the coup attempt and denied any role in it.""I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey,"" he said in an emailed statement reported by The New York Times.""Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force.I pray to God for Turkey, Turkish citizens, and all those currently in Turkey that this situation is resolved peacefully and quickly.As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nPresident Erdoğan asked the United States to extradite Gülen: ""I call on you again, after there was a coup attempt.Extradite this man in Pennsylvania to Turkey!If we are strategic partners or model partners, do what is necessary.""Prime Minister Yildirim has threatened war against any country that would support Gülen.Turkish Labor Minister Süleyman Soylu said that ""America is behind the coup.""\n\nRegarding the AKP\'s statement against Gülen, Secretary of State Kerry invited the Turkish government ""to present us with any legitimate evidence that withstands scrutiny,"" before they would accept an extradition request.\n\nOn 15 August 2016, former United States diplomat James Jeffrey, who was the United States ambassador to Turkey from 2008 until 2010 made the following remarks: ""The Gülen movement has some infiltration at the least in the military that I am aware of.They of course had extreme infiltration into the police and judiciary earlier.I saw that when I was in Turkey previously, particularly in the Sledgehammer case, Hakan Fidan case, and the corruption cases in 2013.Obviously, significant segment of Turkey\'s bureaucracy was infiltrated and had their allegiance to a movement.That of course is absolutely unacceptable and extremely dangerous.It likely led to the coup attempt.""\n\nOutside Turkey, in Beringen, Belgium, anti-coup protesters attempted to attack a building owned by the pro-Gülen movement group \'Vuslat\'.The police brought in a water cannon to keep the attackers at bay.In news articles it was stated that the police also protected the houses of Gülen supporters.People advocated on social media to go to Beringen once more, and there was unrest in Heusden-Zolder, elsewhere in Belgium.Furthermore, in Somalia the government ordered ""the total closure of all activities"" of an organization linked to the Gülen movement, and gave its staff seven days to leave the country.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, President Erdoğan said Western countries were ""supporting terrorism"" and the military coup, saying ""I\'m calling on the United States: what kind of strategic partners are we, that you can still host someone whose extradition I have asked for?""\n\nOn 31 January 2017, British Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, Alan Duncan said he believed the Gülen movement was responsible for the coup attempt.Duncan went on saying ""the organization which incorporated itself into the state tried to topple the democratic structure in Turkey"".\n\nIn a speech on 29 July 2016, President Erdoğan said U.S. Central Command chief Joseph Votel was ""siding with coup plotters""; Erdoğan said the United States was protecting Fethullah Gülen, whom the Turkish government blames for the coup attempt.Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim made similar comments.In response, Votel said that the Turkish government\'s statements were ""unfortunate and completely inaccurate"" and expressed concern that the mass arrests and firings of military officers would damage military cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey.Similarly, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said that the Turkish military purges were impairing the fight against ISIS.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, in an escalation of tensions with the United States, Erdoğan questioned Turkey\'s relationship with the United States and criticized the West, saying that ""script"" for the abortive putsch last month was ""written abroad"".Erdoğan stated that he had personally asked Obama to extradite Gülen to Turkey.When the U.S. government replied it would need evidence of the cleric\'s guilt before extradition, to which Erdoğan said: ""When you asked for the return of a terrorist, we did not ask for documentation. ...Let us put him on trial.""\n\nYeni Şafak daily, a Turkish pro-state newspaper, stated that the former commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, now-retired United States Army General John F. Campbell, was the ""mastermind"" behind the coup attempt in Turkey.Campbell called the statement ""absolutely ridiculous"" and President Obama said ""Any reports that we had any previous knowledge of a coup attempt, that there was any U.S. involvement in it, that we were anything other than entirely supportive of Turkish democracy are completely false, unequivocally false.""\n\nOn 1 December 2017, Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for American political analyst, former CIA official and former vice chairman of US National Intelligence Council Graham Fuller, stating his involvement in the coup.A career US State Department official who was once CIA Station Chief in Kabul and later went on to be a political scientist in Rand Corporation specializing in the Middle East, Turkish authorities said Fuller attended a meeting in Istanbul on 15 July 2016 involving organization and coordination of the botched coup.Another American among the attendance, as stated by the Turkish prosecutors, was academic Henri Barkey who was named a suspect a week after the failed coup.\n\nThe U.S. consulate in Turkey issued an advisory to U.S. citizens to avoid the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey, which houses about 50 nuclear bombs, until ""normal operations have been restored"".They stated that local authorities were denying access to the air base and that power supplying the air base was shut off.\n\nThe Incirlik base is important to the U.S.-led effort in Syria to combat ISIL and other militants.Nearly 1,500 American personnel are housed in the base.\n\nTwenty-four hours after initial reports that the air base was shut down, United States defense department officials confirmed that the base and its airspace had re-opened to military aircraft and that operations by American aircraft will resume.The Turkish commander of the air base, brig.Gen. Bekir Ercan Van was arrested.After the failure of the coup Gen Bekir Ercan Van sought asylum from the U.S., but his request was denied by U.S.\n\nFollowing the failed coup attempt multiple media outlets have published editorials advocating the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Incirlik Air base as Turkey is unstable.\n\nOn 16 July, anti-coup protesters chanted against locals in areas of Istanbul with high concentration of Alevis, including Okmeydanı and Gazi.Such incidents also occurred in a quarter of Antakya with a high Alevi population, where a motorcyclist stating to be a sharia advocate was lynched.In a neighbourhood of Ankara, shops belonging to Syrians were attacked by a mob.In Malatya, Sunni Islamists harassed residents of an Alevi neighbourhood, particularly the women, and attempted to enter the neighbourhood en masse.Police intervened and blocked all roads leading there.In Kadıköy, people drinking alcohol in public were attacked by a group of religious fundamentalists.\n\nFollowing the arrests, thousands of anti-coup protesters demanded instituting the death penalty against detainees connected with the coup, chanting ""we want the death penalty"".President Erdoğan has been open to reinstituting the death penalty, noting that ""in a democracy, whatever the people want they will get.""Turkish authorities have not executed anyone since 1984, but legally abolished capital punishment only in 2004 as a pre-condition to join the European Union.\n\nEuropean Union officials have been vocal about their opposition to purges by Turkish authorities in connection to the coup.French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that Turkey must work within the framework of the law to uphold Europe\'s democratic principles.Furthermore, on 18 July 2016, Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of Foreign Affairs of the European Union, announced that no country will be admitted into the European Union ""if it introduces the death penalty"".Moreover, German press secretary, Steffen Seibert, stated that reinstituting the death penalty will end Turkey\'s accession talks with the European Union.\n\nTurkey is a member of the Council of Europe, and ratified the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) as part of its terms of membership.The ECHR is an international treaty that includes the abolition of the death penalty among its terms.As such, Turkey is legally bound not to reintroduce the death penalty.\n\nOn 20 July 2016, President Erdoğan announced a three-month state of emergency in response to the attempted coup, invoking Article 120 of the Constitution of Turkey (""Declaration of state of emergency because of widespread acts of violence and serious deterioration of public order"").Under the state of emergency, under Article 121, ""the Council of Ministers, meeting under the chairpersonship of the President of the Republic, may issue decrees having the force of law on matters necessitated by the state of emergency"", with decrees subject to subsequent parliamentary approval.The state of emergency was endorsed by the Parliament on 21 July by 346 votes to 115.The Justice and Development Party and the Nationalist Movement Party supported the state of emergency, whilst the Republican People\'s Party and the Peoples\' Democratic Party opposed it.Prime Minister Yıldırım said at the Parliament that the state of emergency was necessary to ""get rid of this scourge rapidly"".\n\nAs part of the state of emergency, deputy prime minister Kurtulmuş announced that Turkey was temporarily suspending part of the European Convention on Human Rights following the attempted coup, invoking Article 15 of the Convention (""war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation"").The suspensions must be notified to the Council of Europe and may not affect the right to a fair trial or the prohibition on torture.\n\nThis state of emergency in Turkey as well as the hindrance of the right to protest that occurred within such framework have been layered onto a longer history of emergency rules, oppressive legislation and daily government practice that have reinforced both.We can see from this the ""autocratisation"" process in Turkey has thrived of existing legal framework deeply associated in legacies of past ""emergencies"".\n\nOn 3 October 2016 Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş declared the governments intention to extend the state of emergency by a further three months raising objections from both the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) and Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) were critical of the governments use of their emergency powers and declared that they would vote against an extension.\n\nFollowing the National Security Council\'s recommendation for the extension President Erdoğan stated that it was possible that the state of emergency could last for longer than a year prompting outcry from the opposition, Leader of the Main Opposition Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu said that ""The president saying that the state of emergency can last longer than 12 months is strengthening the fear of a counter-coup"" and that it was ""raising the prospect of opportunist measures.""\n\nThe AKP\'s governmental majority allowed the three-month extension to take effect on 19 October 2016.The two-year-long state of emergency was ended on 19 July 2018.\n\nOn 16 July 2016, the media reported that eight Turkish military personnel of various ranks had landed in Greece\'s northeastern city of Alexandroupolis on board a Black Hawk helicopter and claimed political asylum in Greece.While the Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu demanded extradition of ""the eight traitors as soon as possible"", the Greek authorities stated: ""We will follow the procedures of international law.However, we give severe considerations to the fact that [the Turkish military men] are accused, in their own country, of violating the constitutional order and trying to overthrow democracy.""The helicopter was returned to Turkey shortly thereafter.The eight asylum seekers, their asylum case pending, were later transferred to Athens, mainly for safety reasons.On 26 January, the Supreme Court of Greece eventually ruled against their extradition, on the grounds that the eight were unlikely to face a fair trial if returned to their home country and due to concerns over their safety.\n\nOn 15 February 2017, five Turkish commandos illegally entered Greece through the Evros river.However, once they entered the country, the group split.The two of them surrendered to the police and on 20 February 2017, requested political asylum.They were being held in the city of Alexandroupolis.The two men belonged to the Turkish navy.The names given by the two reportedly match the names of two fugitives wanted in relation to the shadowy operation against Erdoğan himself.The Greek government mentioned that the Greek authorities will not allow the country to be dragged into the ongoing feud between the Turkish state and the followers of Gulen.But there were no sign of the other three.According to a lawyer there were indications that the other three have been arrested by Greek authorities who were about to expel them to Turkey.According to new evidence and new information these three ""arrested"" marines were delivered under fast and informal procedures from Greek to Turkish services.\n\nAfter the coup attempt, two Turkish military attachés in Athens, Staff Col. İlhan Yaşıtlı and naval attaché Col. Halis Tunç, had reportedly disappeared along with their families.The Greek foreign ministry canceled the two attachés\' accreditations on 7 August 2016, upon the request of the Turkish foreign ministry.Greek media reported that they might have fled to Italy.On 11 August 2016, the Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu confirmed the reports saying that they had left Greece for Italy on 6 August and adding that Turkey would officially ask the Italian authorities to extradite the two soldiers.\n\nOn 9 August 2016, the media reported that Turkey\'s Rear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been on a United States-based assignment for NATO and after the coup was subject to a detention order in Turkey, had sought asylum in the United States.\n\nIn mid-November 2016, it was officially confirmed that about 40 Turkish military servicemen of various ranks stationed at NATO command structures had applied for asylum in Germany and Belgium.\n\nIn January 2017, Der Spiegel magazine and ARD broadcaster reported that about 40 mostly high-ranking Turkish soldiers who worked at NATO facilities in Germany requested asylum in Germany.\n\nAt the end of February 2017, Germany said it had received 136 asylum requests from Turks holding diplomatic passports since the July coup attempt.The figure was a total for August 2016 to January 2017; some were presumed to be military officers posted to NATO bases in Germany.\n\nIn November 2016, NATO\'s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that Turkish NATO Officers had requested asylum in the countries where they had been posted.He did not name the nations involved or the number of officers, saying it was a matter for those countries to decide.He said: ""Some Turkish officers working in NATO command structure ... have requested asylum in the countries where they are working. ...As always, this is an issue that is going to be assessed and decided by the different NATO allies as a national issue.""\n\nAs of March 2017, Norway have granted asylum for four Turkish soldiers and a military attache.\n\nSeveral Turkish citizens with diplomatic passports have sought political asylum in Switzerland.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, detainees in Turkey have been denied access to legal counsel, have been beaten and tortured.They have not been provided with adequate food, water, or medical care.At least one has attempted suicide.Amnesty International wanted the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture to send people to check on detainees conditions.A person who had been on duty at the Ankara police headquarters said that police denied medical treatment to a detainee.""Let him die.We will say he came to us dead,"" the witness quoted a police doctor as saying.\n\nAlso, Erdoğan has extended the maximum period of detention for suspects from four days to 30, a move Amnesty said increased the risk of torture or other maltreatment of detainees.\n\nTurkish Justice Ministry denied the reports and the Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said on his Twitter account: ""There has not been any torture or assault of detainees in custody,"" in response to reports by Amnesty International.""The claims of torture and assault make up a pre-packaged misinformation campaign formed by members of FETÖ, one which is untrue and distorted,""\n\nOn 7 August, between three and five million people gathered for an anti-coup rally organized by the Turkish authorities in Istanbul.President Erdoğan and the two leaders of the major opposition parties (the Republican People\'s Party and the Nationalist Movement Party) were present.\n\nGreek authorities on several Aegean islands have called for emergency measures to curtail a growing flow of refugees from Turkey; the number of migrants and refugees willing to make the journey across the Aegean has increased noticeably after the failed coup.At Athens officials voiced worries because Turkish monitors overseeing the deal in Greece had been abruptly pulled out after the failed coup without being replaced.Also, the mayor of Kos expressed concern in a letter to the Greek Prime Minister citing the growing influx of refugees and migrants after the failed coup.The Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises (SETE) warned about the prospect of another flare-up in the refugee/migrant crisis due to the Turkish political instability.\n\nVincent Cochetel, the director of the Europe Bureau of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in August 2016 that parts of the EU-Turkey deal about immigration were already de facto suspended because no Turkish police were present at Greek detention centres to oversee deportations.\n\nOn 25 August 2016, seven Turkish citizens sought asylum in Greece.Two were university professors, and their two children applied for asylum in Alexandroupoli after they illegally entered the country from the northeastern border.Also, three businessmen illegally reached the Greek island of Rhodes, and they also applied for asylum.\n\nOn 30 August 2016, a Turkish judge arrived at the Greek island of Chios on a migrant boat, with six Syrian nationals, and sought asylum in the country.He told the Greek coastguard and police officers that he is being persecuted in Turkey for his political beliefs by President Tayyip Erdoğan.The Turkish judge had been arrested for illegally entering the country and was transferred to Athens for his asylum proceedings.The Syrian nationals claimed refugee status.\n\nOn 11 September 2016, four Turkish civilians were arrested by Turkish police.An academic and a teacher attempted to escape to Greece illegally by crossing the Evros river, and the other two because they organized the escape attempt.The academic and the teacher paid a total of 12,500 euros in Istanbul to arrange their escape to Greece.Before their attempt, both the academic and the teacher were suspended from their duties as part of the ongoing probe into the failed coup attempt.Police also seized an air raft, an oar and a pump while detaining the suspects.The court later ordered the two\'s release while the other two suspects, who organized the escape attempt, were arrested.\n\nOn 21 September 2016, ten Turkish civilians, two men, two women and six children landed by boat illegally on the Greek island of Rhodes and sought asylum.They told the Greek authorities they were working in the private sector in Turkey and the Turkish government was persecuting them due to their political beliefs.\n\nOn 29 September 2016, five Turkish nationals, a couple and their child and two other men, arrived in Greece, at Alexandroupolis by crossing the Evros River by boat illegally and requested political asylum.\n\nOn 12 December 2016, one female Turkish national, landed by boat, full of refugees and immigrants, illegally on the Greek island of Lesbos.She requested political asylum.\n\nOn 24 October 2017, Turkish authorities obtained information that 995 Turks have applied for asylum in Greece after the coup attempt.\n\nMore than 1,800 Turkish citizens requested asylum in Greece in 2017.\n\nOn 18 February 2018, seventeen Turkish nationals, including six children, requested asylum in Greece at Oinousses island.\n\nIn August 2018, the former lawmaker for the Peoples\' Democratic Party, Leyla Birlik, requested asylum in Greece after illegally crossing the border near Alexandroupolis.\n\nBerlin mayor, Michael Müller (SPD), said Turkey was waging war on supporters of the Gülen movement in Germany.He said that Turkish officials had approached him and asked him whether he would be prepared to confront the Gülen movement in Berlin critically and, if necessary, to support measures against it.The mayor rejected the idea and made it very clear that Turkish conflicts could not be waged in the city.\n\nDer Spiegel presented classified documents, which showed that Turkey\'s secret service (MIT) had asked Germany\'s foreign intelligence agency (BND) for help in rounding up Gülen supporters in Germany.The Turkish secret service wanted the BND to use its influence to spur German lawmakers into taking action against Gülen supporters and extraditing them to Turkey.Also, Turkey\'s government has sent German authorities requests for searches and extraditions linked to supporters of Fethullah Gülen in Germany.\n\nIn Germany businesses thought to be in support of the Gülen movement have been harassed by Erdoğan supporters.\n\nAfter the failed coup, there was a massive demonstration in Cologne at Germany, in late July, in support of Turkish President Erdoğan.Erdoğan wanted to address the participants via video but was rejected by the local authorities and the German Constitutional Court due to security concerns.Turkey said that the ban was unacceptable and a violation of freedom of expression.\n\nGerman authorities said Turkish mosques in Germany were playing Turkish politics and worried that Turkey\'s internal politics spilled over into German cities.For years, German authorities had encouraged Turkey\'s state-run religious institution Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs usually referred to as DİTİB to provide Islamic preachers and teachers and Gülen Movement Schools for the large Turkish diaspora in Germany.DİTİB manages some 900 mosques in Germany.Gülen movement runs 100 educational facilities in Germany.\n\nAfter the failed coup DİTİB published a sermon praising ""our noble nation"" for rising against ""a wretched network"" that had sown ""seeds of sedition, rebellion and hostility.""According to Volker Beck, a member of the center-left Greens in Germany\'s Bundestag, ""That was not a religious text.It was a declaration of obedience to Mr. Erdoğan and his measures since the coup attempt,"" Volker Kauder, parliamentary group leader of the Germany\'s ruling Christian Democrats, the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU)/Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) faction, said Turkish-Germans should be loyal to Germany first and foremost.\n\nGermans of Turkish origin are being pressured in Germany by informers and officers of Turkey\'s MIT spy agency.According to reports Turkey had 6,000 informants plus MIT officers in Germany who were putting pressure on ""German Turks"".Hans-Christian Ströbele said that there was an ""unbelievable"" level of ""secret activities"" in Germany by Turkey\'s MIT agency.According to Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, not even the former communist East German Stasi secret police had managed to run such a large ""army of agents"" in the former West Germany: ""Here, it\'s not just about intelligence gathering, but increasingly about intelligence service repression.""\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nGermany\'s Office for Migration and Refugees said on 18 November 2016, it had received 4,437 political asylum requests from Turkish citizens up to October, compared to 1,767 for the whole of last year.""We must expect that the number of Turks who are seeking political asylum in Germany will continue to rise,"" said Stephan Mayer, the domestic policy speaker of the union coalition in the Bundestag.\n\nOn 10 December 2016, eleven Turkish nationals, 10 adults and one child, in a martial arts group have applied for asylum in Germany.\n\nAs of January 2018, Germany was first place and Greece second as EU destinations of choice for Turkish nationals requesting asylum after the coup attempt.\n\nTurkish police have carried out simultaneous raids in 18 cities against companies associated with United States-based Fethullah Gülen.The state-run Anadolu Agency said police searched 204 premises and detained 187 businessmen for ""membership in a terror organization"" and ""providing financial support to a terror organization"".All suspects\' assets were seized.\n\nWikiLeaks released Turkish emails and documents to respond to the Turkish government\'s purges that followed the coup attempt.In turn, the Turkish Telecommunications Communications Board blocked access to the WikiLeaks website.On 17 July 2016 Wikileaks had announced on Twitter, the leak of approximately 300,000 emails and over 500,000 documents, including those to and from AKP.\n\nWikiLeaks stated that it was attacked shortly after 17 July announcement of the planned publication and hypothesized that Turkish authorities were responsible.WikiLeaks stated in a tweet, ""our infrastructure is under sustained attack.""Tweets from WikiLeaks include ""We are unsure of the true origin of the attack.The timing suggests a Turkish state power faction or its allies.We will prevail & publish.""and: ""Turks will likely be censored to prevent them reading our pending release of 100k+ docs on politics leading up to the coup."", ""We ask that Turks are ready with censorship bypassing systems such as TorBrowser and uTorrent""; ""And that everyone else is ready to help them bypass censorship and push our links through the censorship to come.""\n\nUpon the release of the email dump, it has been reported that the emails contain little to no damning information, and instead are just mails from a public mailing list, but also linked externally to ""voter information on all of the women registered to vote in 78 out of Turkey\'s 81 provinces"".\n\nSeveral places were renamed to commemorate the failed coup: Boğaziçi Köprüsü (Bosphorus Bridge) → 15 Temmuz Şehitler Köprüsü Kızılay Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Kızılay Demokrasi Meydanı Ahmet Taner Kışlalı Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Milli İrade Meydanı (Reverted to original name a few days later) Büyük İstanbul Otogarı → İstanbul 15 Temmuz Demokrasi Otogarı In TRT, Yeni Haber Stüdyosu → 15 Temmuz Millet Stüdyosu Kazan → Kahramankazan about the province\'s local people\'s resistance to the coup plotters.Kahraman means ""hero"" in Turkish Niğde University → Niğde Ömer Halisdemir University\n\nIn 2018, the Istanbul Municipal Council decided to change the names of a total of 90 streets that included words which could be associated with FETÖ.\n\nThe Presidency of Religious Affairs stated that it would not be providing religious funeral services to the dead coupists, except for ""privates and low-ranking officers compelled by force and threats who found themselves in the midst of the conflict without full knowledge of anything"".\n\nA document dated 26 September 2016 showed that Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) asked Turkish missions and religious representatives abroad to profile Gülen movement expatriates living in their respective foreign countries.Gülen-linked schools, businesses, foundations, associations, media outlets and others were also included in the reports.Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs has gathered intelligence via imams from 38 countries.\n\nBelgium officials said they would withdraw recognition of Diyanet mosques in the country if necessary.\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nOn 21 December 2016, the Turkish government has recalled Yusuf Acar, the religious affairs attaché of the Turkish Embassy in the Netherlands, after Dutch authorities said he was spying.Acar collected information of people who sympathize with Fethullah Gülen at Netherlands and passed it on to the Turkish authorities.The Dutch government called spying activities an ""unwanted and non-acceptable interference in the lives of Dutch citizens.""and the attaché was reportedly declared persona non grata and received a ""deportation warning"" by Dutch authorities.\n\nOn 26 January 2017, President Erdoğan, during his visit to Tanzania, asked his Tanzanian counterpart John Magufuli to take action against the network of Fethullah Gülen.\n\nIn April 2017 it was announced that President Erdoğan planned to establish a purpose-built museum dedicated to the coup events, called the ""Museum of the 15 July: Martyrs and Democracy"", to be located in Kahramankazan, a town near Ankara.Paid for by Turkish Ministry of Culture funds, it is planned to open at the end of 2018.The museum opened in December 2019\n\nAmong the Turkish opposition parties, the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) issued a statement expressing their public opposition to the coup, and the Hürriyet Daily News reported that Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bahçeli telephoned Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım to express his opposition to the coup.The co-chairs of the opposition Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) issued a statement saying that the party was ""under all circumstances and as a matter of principle against all kinds of coup.""Amongst the minor parties, left-wing nationalist Patriotic Party\'s Doğu Perinçek backed democracy, when he held Gülen and the Americans responsible.Kurdish militant separatist organization Kurdistan Workers\' Party, which Turkey and its allies label as a terrorist organization, urged their supporters to stay away from the coup and rather defend their people, while the Communist Party called upon the people to overthrow the AKP government which they called an ""enemy of humanity"".\n\nDuring the first hours of the coup plotters\' moves of blocking Istanbul\'s bridges and flying fighter jets low over Istanbul and Ankara, Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjørn Jagland tweeted against the coup attempt and underlined that ""any attempt to overthrow the democratically elected leaders is unacceptable"".\n\nRussia\'s President Vladimir Putin called Erdoğan out of solidarity before all NATO member countries\' heads following the coup attempt.Erdoğan thanked the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev – who was the first president to show solidarity after the coup attempt – for his support in solving the 7-month crisis over downed Russian Sukhoi Su-24 and the Prime Minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, who was among the first NATO country leaders to condemn the coup attempt, already from the early hours of Saturday.\n\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the then prime minister of Pakistan, was all praise for the people of Turkey and the AKP government and strongly condemned what he termed as an attempt to undermine democracy in Turkey.""We deeply admire the resolve of the brave and resilient Turkish people, who stood up against the forces of darkness and anarchy to express their support and commitment to democracy,"" the PM said in a statement issued from his office.\n\nThe majority of countries either expressed their support for the government or called for restraint.On 16 July 2016, however, a proposed United Nations Security Council statement denouncing the coup was not accepted by Egypt, a non-permanent member of the Council at the time, due to textual disagreements.Egyptian diplomats said that the council is ""in no position to qualify, or label [the Turkish] government – or any other government for that matter – as democratically elected or not"".Objection by the United States and the UK – permanent members of the Security Council – led to Egypt proposing a new statement calling for all sides to ""respect the democratic and constitutional principles and the rule of law"", which was rejected, preventing the condemnation of the coup attempt by the Security Council.The leader of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky supported the coup attempt.\n\nAl-Monitor reported that ""Unlike Ankara\'s Western allies, Iran did not wait for the coup\'s failure to speak up.Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif voiced support for democracy in a Twitter message in the early hours of the unrest, writing ""Stability, and democracy in Turkey are paramount"".In a subsequent phone call after the failure of the coup attempt, President Hassan Rouhani told Erdoğan the coup attempt was ""a test to identify your domestic and foreign friends and enemies.""An Iranian official pointed out parallels between the coup attempt in Turkey and the coup against Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mussadiq in 1953: ""What we know is that this attempt was triggered by foreign hands.We have experienced the same thing in the past.Since Mr. Erdogan wants to play a more positive path in the region today, they want to overthrow him.""\n\nMustafa Akıncı, President of Northern Cyprus, welcomed the fact that ""no community in Turkey ... applauded the coup as they have done in the past.""Azerbaijan strongly condemned the attempted military coup in Turkey and considered such actions unacceptable according to a statement from Novruz Mammadov, deputy head of the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration and chief of the foreign relations department.\n\nEuropean Commissioner dealing with Turkey\'s EU membership bid, Johannes Hahn, said it appears Turkey\'s government prepared arrest lists of political opponents before the coup attempt and had been waiting for the right time to act.In this sense, EU reported that as a main criticism to put this issue in the category of terrorism become the violation of the fundamental rights and fundamental values of the citizens.Hence, it underlines a total divergence of opinions and mentality between EU and Turkey which reached a deadlock here especially after the 15th of July in 2016.\n\nOn 19 July 2016, White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said during a press briefing that President Barack Obama has held a phone conversation with President Erdoğan: ""The President used the phone call to reiterate once again the strong commitment of the United States to the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey.The President pledged any needed assistance to the Turkish government as they conduct an investigation to determine exactly what happened.""\n\nOn 20 July 2016, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""Turkey has a large armed force, professional armed forces and ...I am certain they will continue as a committed and strong NATO ally.""On a statement released on 10 August 2016, the Secretary General once more strongly condemned the attempted coup and reiterated full support for Turkey\'s democratic institutions.He also expressed support for the elected Turkish government and respect for the courage of the Turkish people for resisting the coup plotters.\n\nOn 29 July 2016, the commander of U.S. Central Command, General Joseph Votel, denied statements by Turkey\'s president Erdoğan that he has supported the coup attempt in Turkey.\n\nOn 1 August 2016, United States Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, General Joseph Dunford, visited Turkey and condemned the coup attempt.Dunford said: ""The consistent theme throughout the day was a reaffirmation of the importance of the U.S.-Turkey relationship – the need for us to cooperate.""\n\nOn July, 20, there were reports that a group of Turkish military commandos coup fugitives would try to cross from Turkey to the island of Symi, in the southeastern Aegean, at Greece.The Hellenic Coast Guard was on alert and increased the patrols in the area, especially after a group of inflatable dinghies and other vessels were seen departing from Datça, on the Turkish coast, in the direction of Symi, they monitored the movements of the Turkish vessels, which remained in Turkish waters.Furthermore, a contingent of the Hellenic Police was dispatched to Symi to conduct checks there.The Greek government had been anticipating a possible attempt by participants in the failed coup to come to Greece and took the reports seriously.Turkish F-16 fighter jets were also scrambled to check reports that missing Turkish coast guard vessels had appeared in Greek waters in the Aegean.Later on the day, the Turkish interior ministry denied reports that rebel soldiers might have ""hijacked"" a vessel to flee to Greece.The Greek armed forces remained on alert the throughout the day for potential coup fugitives.\n\nAccording to Michael Rubin, from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Erdoğan had himself to blame for the coup.Following an increasingly Islamist agenda, Erdoğan had reportedly ""dropped any pretense of governing for all Turks.""After ""fanning the flames"" at the 2013 Gezi Park protests, he transformed the predominantly Kurdish-inhabited areas of southeastern Turkey ""into a war zone reminiscent of the worst days of the 1980s.""The biggest problem, according to Rubin, might have been Erdoğan\'s foreign policy, which managed to turn the initial ""no problems with neighbors"" doctrine into a situation where the country has problems with almost every neighbor and has even alienated some of its allies and friends.Rubin previously worked as an official at the Pentagon and less than 4 months before the coup, he wrote an article in Newsweek magazine titled, ""Will There Be a Coup Against Erdogan in Turkey?""\n\nBritish Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk warned that ""too late did Erdoğan realize the cost of the role he had chosen for his country.It\'s one thing to say sorry to Putin and patch up relations with Netanyahu; but when you can no longer trust your army, there are more serious matters to concentrate upon.""Even if this coup may have failed, Fisk expected another to follow in the months or years to come.\n\nTurkish professor Akın Ünver described the coup d\'état attempt as ""more of a mutiny"".\n\nThe name of the ""Peace at Home Council"" – Yurtta Sulh Konseyi – is derived from Atatürk\'s famous saying \'Peace at Home, Peace in the World\'.Journalist Ezgi Başaran said that ""the statement of the junta, that was [...] read on the [...] government TV [channel] as the coup got under way, bore a strong resemblance to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk\'s famous address to the Turkish Youth.[...] On the other hand, given that these references are too obvious, they may have been intentionally included to insinuate a Kemalist junta rather than a Gülenist one.""\n\nThe citizen journalism site Bellingcat published an analysis of the messages of a WhatsApp group consisting of high-ranking military officials who had taken part in the coup covering their activities including them killing several people.The messages were cross referenced with video footage.The group was named ""Yurtta sulh"" which refers to a peace at home speech and they seem secular and military with no references to Gülen or anything related during the several hours of messaging.\n\nNews reports have suggested that the coup ringleader was Adil Öksüz.Some believe Öksüz to have been an operative with Turkish intelligence.\n\nGerman Islamic studies scholar said the putschists tried to forestall a large-scale purge of judiciary and military, the implementation of which had already started on Saturday, the day after the coup attempt.According to Turkish investigative journalist Ahmet Şık, a list of officials to be purged had been ready compiled by the attorney-general of Izmir, Okan Bato, and was approved by President Erdoğan.According to this version, the putschists had to quickly bring forward their coup attempt before being disposed and arrested.\n\nDuring and after the events, several politicians and commentators suggested that the government knew about the coup in advance and possibly directed it.The facts that the coup attempt began in the evening rather than at a more inconspicuous time and that the events were largely confined to Ankara and Istanbul contributed to doubts about the authenticity of the coup attempt.Journalists and opposition politicians branded it a \'tragic comedy\' and \'theatre play\'.Advocates of such theories pointed to how Erdoğan stood to gain from the coup attempt in terms of increasing his popularity and support for his calls for an executive presidency, while being able to legitimize further crackdowns on judicial independence and the opposition in general.\n\nOther elements that were reported to support the theory included: no list of demands by the coup plotters, the organization and response of the police, the long lists of arrests that seemed to be ready surprisingly quickly (including arrests of 2,745 judges and 2,839 soldiers), and the obvious nature of the coup actions.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom Erdoğan had said as being one of the principal conspirators, commented, ""I don\'t believe that the world believes the accusations made by President Erdoğan.There is a possibility that it could be a staged coup and it could be meant for further accusations [against the Gülenists].""Journalist Cengiz Çandar, a veteran observer of Turkey\'s coups, said ""I have never seen any with this magnitude of such inexplicable sloppiness.""Prominent Hizmet (Gülen movement) spokesman Alp Aslandogan said, referencing that the Turkish Air Force commander met with Erdoğan before 15 July, that certain legal documentation related to the coup seemed written beforehand, arguing that within ""the indictment written by a prosecutor on the night of 15 July to 16 July, there were events there that didn\'t actually happen.Some events did happen, but those events didn\'t happen by the time the document started.It looks like a bigger plan was there, and part of the plan did not come to pass.""\n\nThe organization and spontaneous synchronization by large numbers of mosques was perceived to be unachievable unless there had been prior preparation, with journalists also pointing to how Erdoğan could have strategically used the call to prayer to invoke religious sentiment in a political situation as a veiled attack on state secularism.\n\nThousands of arrests and purges were conducted by Turkish authorities between 16 and 18 July 2016.The sheer number of these arrests made at such a speed could only be done so if the ""Turkish government had all those lists ready"", as suggested by Johannes Hahn, European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, on 18 July 2016.Hahn also said that because these lists were already available immediately after the coup, the ""event was prepared"" and the lists were to be used ""at a certain stage"".\n\nMehmet Dişli, who was seen giving orders to the coup plotters and who was the one who put a belt around Hulusi Akar\'s neck to make him sign, is the brother of Şaban Dişli, a former vice president of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and confidant of Erdoğan.\n\nSeveral social media users have compared the coup attempt to the Reichstag fire in 1933, which Adolf Hitler used as an excuse to suspend civil liberties and order mass arrests of his opponents.Politico correspondent Ryan Heath said that ""the coup was staged to allow Erdoğan to purge the military of opponents and increase his grip on the country"".Heath used Twitter to share comments from his Turkish source, who called the events of Friday night a ""fake coup"" which would help a ""fake democracy warrior"" (referring to Erdoğan).The source said: ""Probably we\'ll see an early election [in] which he\'ll try to guarantee an unbelievable majority of the votes.And this will probably guarantee another 10–15 years of authoritarian, elected dictatorship.""\n\nThe New York Times reported that some Turkish citizens believed the coup attempt was staged by Erdoğan to improve his public image and popularity, while cracking down on political opponents and expanding his power.Critics found it suspect that reportedly no government officials were arrested or harmed during the attempted coup, which—among other factors—raised the suspicion of a false flag event staged by the Turkish government to crack down on opposition parties.Those in Turkey suggesting that the coup was staged are also being questioned by the government.\n\nPoliticians and journalists who were skeptical of the authenticity of the coup plot said that in reality, a \'civil coup\' had effectively been staged against the Armed Forces and Judiciary, both of which were extensively purged of stated Gülen supporters by the government shortly after the events.Skeptics said that the coup would be used as an excuse for further erosion of judicial independence and a crackdown on the opposition, giving the AKP greater and unstoppable power over all state institutions and paving the way for a more radical Islamist agenda at odds with the founding principles of the Turkish Republic.\n\nJustice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said in late July 2016 that Turkish social media users who said the government was staging the coup faced investigation: ""Just look at the people who are saying on social media that this was theatre.Public prosecutors are already investigating them.Most of them are losers who think it is an honor to die for Fethullah Gülen\'s command.""\n\nOn 12 July 2017, Stockholm Center for Freedom, a monitoring group with reported links to the Gülen movement, published a controversial report stating that President Erdogan orchestrated the coup bid as a false flag to consolidate his powers, set up his opposition for a mass persecution, and push Turkish Armed Forces into a military incursion into Syria.According to the report, it uncovered new evidence from 11 July 2016, four days before the planned coup bid, that a secret plan was circulated among select group of Armed Forces to give an appearance of a coup attempt.The plan was sanctioned by intelligence and military chiefs with the approval of Erdogan.\n\nIn early November 2017, Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for , former Director of the Middle East Program of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, stating that he is an agent of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), that he was present in Istanbul during the 2016 Turkish coup attempt, and that he was one of the key organizers behind the coup attempt.Around 1 December, the Istanbul prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for Graham E. Fuller, an American author and political analyst specializing in Islamic extremism after a long CIA career and holding the role of vice-chair of the United States National Intelligence Council.The prosecutor\'s office based the warrant on suspicion of Fuller helping to plan the coup attempt.Hürriyet stated that Turkish authorities believed that they had traced Fuller\'s location before the attempted coup and afterward when he left Turkey.\n\nBarkey denied his reported role in the coup, describing the claims as ""so ludicrous that they do not even deserve the term \'science fiction\'.""\n\nDeep state in Turkey The Imam\'s Army List of coups and coup attempts since 2010 List of modern conflicts in the Middle East List of attacks on legislatures\n', 'Claim_Context': 'In March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.

110,"{'Wiki_Title': '2016 Turkish coup attempt', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'On 15 July 2016, a faction within the Turkish Armed Forces, organized as the Peace at Home Council, attempted a coup d\'état against state institutions, including the government and president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.They attempted to seize control of several places in Ankara, Istanbul, Marmaris and elsewhere, such as the Asian side entrance of the Bosphorus Bridge, but failed to do so after forces and civilians loyal to the state defeated them.The Council cited an erosion of secularism, elimination of democratic rule, disregard for human rights, and Turkey\'s loss of credibility in the international arena as reasons for the coup.The government said it had evidence the coup leaders were linked to the Gülen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the Republic of Turkey and led by Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish businessman and a well-known Islamic scholar who lives in exile in Pennsylvania.The Turkish government alleged that Gülen was behind the coup (which Gülen denied) and that the United States was harboring him.Events surrounding the coup attempt and the purges in its aftermath reflect a complex power struggle between Islamist elites in Turkey.\n\nDuring the coup attempt, over 300 people were killed and more than 2,100 were injured.Many government buildings, including the Turkish Parliament and the Presidential Palace, were bombed from the air.Mass arrests followed, with at least 40,000 detained, including at least 10,000 soldiers and 2,745 judges, for being affiliated with the coup attempt.15,000 education staff were also suspended and the licenses of 21,000 teachers working at private institutions were revoked after the government stated they were loyal to Gülen.More than 77,000 people have been arrested and over 160,000 fired from their jobs, on reports of connections to Gülen.\n\nThere were many reactions against the coup attempt, both domestically and internationally.The main opposition parties in Turkey condemned the attempt, while several international leaders—such as those of the United States, NATO, the European Union, and neighboring countries—called for ""respect of the democratic institutions in Turkey and its elected officials.""Many international organizations also opposed the coup.The United Nations Security Council, however, did not denounce the coup after disagreements over the phrasing of a statement.Iran opposed the coup and advised Erdogan to defeat the coup plotters.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the head of United States Central Command, General Joseph Votel, was ""siding with coup plotters"", after Votel criticized the Turkish government for arresting the Pentagon\'s contacts in Turkey.\n\nIn March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.The same month, the British Parliament\'s Foreign Affairs Select Committee said some Gulenists were involved in the coup d\'état attempt but found no hard evidence that Fethullah Gülen masterminded the failed coup and found no evidence to justify the United Kingdom designating the Gülen movement as a ""terrorist organization"".\n\nSince the 1970s, followers of the influential cleric Fethullah Gülen had assumed increasingly important positions within the Turkish state apparatus.Gülen several times advised his followers to take key positions in society and government, if necessary with a secret identity to avoid opposition from the laicistic Turkish army and government.Nevertheless, at the start of the 21st century, Gülen\'s followers achieved crucial positions of power in Turkey (and beyond) with a vast network of newspapers, TV channels, schools, associations, lobby organizations, financial institutions and positions within the state such as the army and the judiciary.Initially, the then Prime Minister Erdogan seemingly tolerated the power of the Gülen movement because of common interests such as limiting the undemocratic political power of the military, but also because of impotence and fear of Gülen\'s power within Turkey.\n\nA series of events eventually led to a rift between Erdogan and Gülen.For example, prosecutors that allegedly were aligned with the Gülen movement tried to arrest the intelligence chief Hakan Fidan for the peace negotiations with the PKK, and by extension PM Erdogan subsequently, as the Turkish secret service is directly subordinate to the prime minister of Turkey.During this period (2010-2013), state secrets were leaked, fraud was committed with the entrance exams for government employees (KPSS), a change of power occurred at the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) and (sex)tapes of both government members and opposition members were leaked.Following these events and other incidents, the Turkish government decided to designate the Gülen movement as parallel state and FETÖ (Fethullahist Terror Organization).Alleged Gülen supporters were fired or arrested.The coup attempt that followed is therefore also described by some analysts as a last desperate attempt by Gülenists to retain power.\n\nIt is widely reported that Kemalist ideology played a huge role in motivating the 15 July 2016 coup attempt, like all previous political interventions in the history of Turkey\'s military coups.Since the establishment of multiparty democracy in Turkey in 1946, the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), together with the judiciary, have viewed themselves as guardians of Kemalist ideals and the secular Turkish nationalist state established under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk against political parties that have promoted a larger role for Islam and minorities in public life.The military and judiciary have regularly intervened in politics to block or ban popular parties representing conservative Muslim Turks, attempting to relax the restrictions on traditional religious practices, such as women\'s wearing of headscarves.The military has toppled four elected governments: by coups in 1960 and 1980, and by military decisions in 1971 and 1997.The military has also banned several major political parties.In 1998, Erdoğan, then-mayor of Istanbul, was banned for life from politics and jailed because he had read a religious poem by Ziya Gökalp several years before, at a public meeting.In 2007, the military expressed its opposition to the election of Abdullah Gül, of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), as president, by issuing an e-memorandum.Still, Gül was eventually elected when the AKP won both a referendum on the matter.Also, a snap election, and the party returned with a larger majority in the parliament.The military cited erosion of secularism as one of the reasons for the coup in the statement published on the day of the coup.\n\nAs opposed to previous political interventions by the Turkish military, Turkey\'s AKP government and pro-state media maintain that the 15 July 2016 coup attempt was not motivated by allegiance to Kemalist ideology, but rather to the vast political, economic, and religious network led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen.Between 2007 and 2012, high-profile Kemalists, including high-ranking officers of the Turkish Armed Forces, faced a series of trials and purges, under reports of involvement in a secret society codenamed ""Ergenekon.""Supported by Islamist (both pro-Gülen and pro-Erdoğan) prosecutors, security officials, and media, the purges allowed lower-rank Islamist officers to assume high-ranking military positions.They were seen as a bid by Turkey\'s civilian leaders under President Erdoğan to establish dominance over the military.In these trials in 2013 – viewed as ""sensational"" and ""one of the biggest in recent Turkish history"" – 275 people, including senior military officers, journalists, lawyers, and academics, were said to be involved in the so-called ""Ergenekon"" conspiracy, reportedly plotting a coup in 2003/04 against then–Prime Minister Erdoğan.Additionally, some military officers were said to be involved in a separate reported plot, Sledgehammer.Simultaneously, Erdoğan promoted lower-ranking officers up the chain of command, ensuring that the military chief of staff was loyal to him and thereby demoralizing the army.\n\nThe AKP\'s alliance with Gülen started to collapse during 2013 as Gülenists targeted the AKP using corruption charges.After the split, Erdoğan decided it would be advantageous to rehabilitate the army.The ""Ergenekon"" convictions were overturned in April 2016 by the Court of Cassation, which ruled that the existence of the network was unproven.\n\nIn 2013, law enforcement efforts to fight corruption, which had led to the 2013 corruption scandal in Turkey, were faulted by Erdoğan.The anti-corruption efforts were a source of tension between the Gülenists and the AKP.In political analysis in the months prior to the coup attempt, the incidence of corruption was reported to be ""rife"" in Turkey.Following the coup attempt, some coup leaders cited corruption as a reason for their actions.\n\nOn 13 July, less than two days before the coup was launched, Erdoğan signed a bill giving Turkish soldiers immunity from prosecution while taking part in domestic operations.The bill requires cases against commanders to be approved by the prime minister, while district governors may sign cases against lower-ranking soldiers.The immunity bill was seen as part of the détente between the government and the armed forces.The latter has increasingly been taking over military operations in Kurdish-inhabited areas from police and paramilitary units.\n\nOn 15 July 2016, as reported just before 23:00 EEST (UTC+3), military jets were spotted flying over Ankara, and both the Fatih Sultan Mehmet and Bosphorus bridges in Istanbul were closed.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said military action was being ""taken outside the chain of command"" and it was an ""illegal attempt"" to seize power by ""part of the military"".He further said that those involved ""will pay the highest price.""Local media also reported tanks in Istanbul\'s Atatürk Airport.It was reported that Internet users within Turkey were blocked from accessing Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.Twitter later stated that it had ""no reason to think we\'ve been fully blocked"".Some hostages were taken at military headquarters, including the Turkish Chief of the General Staff Hulusi Akar.At around 21:00, the coupists had invited Salih Zeki Çolak, the commander of the Turkish Land Forces to the military headquarters.When he arrived, he was immediately apprehended.Abidin Ünal, head of the Turkish Air Force, who had been attending a wedding in Istanbul, was abducted from there by soldiers who descended from a helicopter.The coupists then tried to force Akar to sign the coup declaration, almost strangling him using a belt in the process.He refused and was then taken to the Akıncı Air Base and other commanders at the headquarters.The military also entered the Justice and Development Party\'s offices in Istanbul and asked people to leave.\n\nEarly reports said President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was safe in Marmaris, south-west Turkey, where he had been on holiday.\n\nFrom around 23:00 to midnight, helicopters bombed the police special forces headquarters and police air force headquarters in Gölbaşı, just outside of Ankara.The attacks left 42 dead and 43 injured.Türksat headquarters in Gölbaşı was also attacked, killing two security personnel.\n\nAt around 23:50, soldiers occupied Taksim Square in central Istanbul.\n\nAt 00:02, it was reported by Reuters that soldiers were inside the buildings of the state broadcaster, the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), in Ankara.During the coup attempt, soldiers forced anchor Tijen Karaş to read out a statement saying that ""the democratic and secular rule of law has been eroded by the current government"" and that Turkey was now led by the Peace at Home Council who would ""ensure the safety of the population.""The statement read in part: ""Turkish Armed Forces have completely taken over the administration of the country to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedoms, the rule of law and general security that was damaged.[...] All international agreements are still valid.We hope that all of our good relationships with all countries will continue.""The plotters said they had ""done so to preserve democratic order, and that the rule of law must remain a priority"".The statement also ordered temporary martial law (sıkıyönetim), and said a new constitution would be prepared ""as soon as possible"".TRT was then taken off air.\n\nOther media outlets were also raided by the putschists, such as Turkish newspaper Hürriyet and private broadcaster CNN Türk.\n\nReuters reported on 15 July that an EU source described the coup as ""well orchestrated,"" and predicted that ""given the scale of the operation, it is difficult to imagine they will stop short of prevailing.""Another EU diplomat said that the Turkish ambassador in his capital was shocked and ""taking it very seriously"".\n\nThe Peace at Home Council was reportedly chaired by Muharrem Köse.\n\nAdana: Upon receiving the intelligence that thirty soldiers from the 10th Air Base Command would move to the base where the regional and provincial gendarmerie commands were located, the police prevented the soldiers from leaving the guardhouse with TOMA and armored vehicles and blocked them.Bitlis: In the Tatvan district of Bitlis, on the orders of Brigade Commander Arif Seddar Afşar, helicopters were circulated in the skies of Tatvan and fired at the city.The brigade command left the municipality\'s construction equipment in front of the barracks in case there was a tank operation in the district.Denizli: Approximately five hundred officers and non-commissioned officers who participated in the coup attempt surrendered to the gendarmerie and police forces.They were interrogated at Çardak District Gendarme Command.Kars: With the order of Kars 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, the soldiers who came with tanks and armored personnel carriers surrounded the Police Headquarters building and wanted to detain Faruk Karaduman, the chief of police.At the same hours, the invitation of Deputy Governors, 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, went to the command.Kocaeli: Turkcell\'s data center in Gebze was raided by soldiers who participated in the coup attempt.Soldiers who tried to interrupt the internet service were detained.Malatya: A rebellious soldier opened fire inside a base of the Turkish 2nd Army, damaging six vehicles.The base was besieged by police and loyal soldiers, and the shooter was captured.Marmaris: Three military helicopters carried out a bomb attack on the hotel where Erdoğan was staying.Forty rebellious soldiers of the Special Forces Command clashed with the police in the region.Mersin: Mersin Garrison and Mediterranean Region Commander Admiral Nejat Atilla Demirhan called Mersin Provincial Police Deputy Chief Yakup Usta and Gendarmerie Colonel Mustafa Bakçepınar and stated that the Turkish Armed Forces had taken over the administration.He introduced himself as the martial law garrison commander and ordered Mersin Governor Özdemir Çakacak and district governors to be taken into custody.Demirhan and Dağdelen, who made the same announcement with the police radio obtained from Mersin Police Department, were detained through the operation of the security forces.Sakarya: Sakarya Governorship was captured with armored personnel carriers, military trucks and many military jeeps from the military unit in the Kandıra district of Kocaeli.As a reinforcement, two military vehicles full of soldiers from the Sakarya central division command had to return to their barracks in the face of the resistance of the police and the harsh reaction of the people who took to the streets against the putschists.The vehicles occupying the Sakarya Governorate were seized by the citizens and the soldiers in them were neutralized and handed over to the security forces.Afterwards, citizens and security forces entered the governor\'s office and neutralized the soldiers there and suppressed the uprising in the province.Eight civilian citizens were injured as a result of the fire opened by the military during the incident.Şırnak: Çakırsöğüt Gendarmerie Commando Brigadier General Ali Osman Gürcan and 309 soldiers, that participated in the coup attempt, were detained by the security forces.\n\nTurkey\'s Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım responded to the events by stating that an ""illegal action is taking place outside of the chain of command"".He also said that ""the government elected by the people remains in charge and this government will only go when the people say so.""The Turkish Presidential office said President Erdoğan was on holiday inside Turkey and condemned the coup attempt as an attack on democracy.A presidential source also said Erdoğan and his government were still in power.The first messages from Erdoğan were transmitted at around 00:23At about 01:00, Erdoğan did a FaceTime interview with CNN Türk, in which he called upon his supporters to take to the streets in defiance of the military-imposed curfew, saying ""There is no power higher than the power of the people.Let them do what they will at the public squares and airports.""Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş appeared on live television, saying Turkey\'s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is still in charge of the government.The mayor of Ankara, Melih Gökçek of the AKP, encouraged people to go out to the city\'s streets in defiance, despite a curfew imposed by the military.Erdoğan\'s plane took off from Dalaman Airport near Marmaris at 23:47, but had to wait in the air south of Atatürk for the airport to be secured.His plane landed at 02:50\n\nThe First Army General Command in Istanbul stated in a news conference that the TSK did not support the coup and the perpetrators represented a tiny faction that were on the verge of being brought under control.Istanbul Atatürk Airport was closed; all flights from the airport were cancelled.There was an explosion in the TRT broadcasting headquarters and gunfire was reported in Ankara.Soon after, it was stormed by a crowd of civilians and police, with four soldiers inside reportedly being ""neutralized"".The channel went back on air and Karaş, who had previously announced the coup, said live that she had been held hostage and forced to read the declaration of the coup at gunpoint.\n\nBy 01:00, it was reported that the military had pulled its forces from the Atatürk airport and people were coming inside, but by 01:13, it was reported that tanks were inside the airport and gunfire was heard.\n\nTanks opened fire near the Turkish Parliament Building.The parliamentary building was also hit from the air.Injuries were reported among protesters following gunfire on Bosphorus Bridge.\n\nA helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was shot down by a Turkish military F-16 fighter jet.There were also reports of pro-state jets flying over Ankara to ""neutralize"" helicopters used by those behind the coup.\n\nAt 03:08, a military helicopter opened fire on the Turkish parliament.At 03:10, Turkish Armed Forces stated on their website that they had complete control over the country.At 03:12, Yıldırım made a statement saying that the situation was under control and that a no-fly zone was declared over Ankara and that military planes that still flew would be shot down.\n\nIt was reported that the Turkish parliament had been bombed again at 03:23 and 03:33.A helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was also seen flying by it.Half an hour following the report of 12 deaths and 2 injuries in the parliament, soldiers entered CNN Türk\'s headquarters and forced the studio to go off air.After an hour of interruption by the pro-coup soldiers, CNN Türk resumed its broadcast.Later, İsmail Kahraman said a bomb exploded at a corner of the public relations building inside the parliament, with no deaths but several injuries among police officers.\n\nAt around 04:00 two or three helicopters attacked Erdogan\'s hotel.According to eyewitness accounts, ten to fifteen heavily armed men landed and started firing.In the ensuing conflict, two policemen were killed and 8 were injured.\n\nThe Doğan News Agency reported that in Istanbul several individuals were injured after soldiers fired on a group of people attempting to cross the Bosphorus Bridge in protest of the attempted coup.\n\nOn Saturday 16 July 2016, at 00:42 EEST (UTC+3), a Turkish Black Hawk helicopter sent a distress signal and requested permission from Greek authorities for an emergency landing, and landed eight minutes later (00:50) at the Dimokritos airport in Alexandroupoli, in Greece, while two Greek F-16s observed the procedure and escorted it to the airport.The first reports said that the passengers were seven military personnel and a civilian.Later, it turned out that all were military personnel (two majors, four captains and two non-commissioned officers).They had removed the badges and insignia from their uniforms, making it impossible to know their rank.All were arrested after landing for illegal entry into the country.They were transferred to the local police station, while the Greek authorities at the airport guarded the helicopter.The eight passengers all requested political asylum in Greece as they believed they would not get a fair trial in Turkey.On 21 September 2016, Greece denied three out of the eight asylum.The men\'s lawyer Stavroula Tomara said they would be appealing the decision and said they had the ""impression that the decision has been predetermined, and that the interview was conducted just as a formality.""On 11 October 2016, four more of the eight were denied asylum.Two of the men who had previously been denied asylum applied for a re-evaluation but their applications were also rejected.\n\nAfter Erdoğan flew into Istanbul, he made a televised speech inside the airport at around 04:00, whilst thousands gathered outside.He addressed a crowd of supporters in the airport, at about 06:30 He said, ""In Turkey, armed forces are not governing the state or leading the state.They cannot.""He blamed ""those in Pennsylvania"" (a reference to Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, and his Hizmet Movement) for the coup attempt.Erdoğan also said he had plans to ""clean up"" the army, saying that ""This uprising is a gift from God to us.""State-run Anadolu Agency named former Colonel Muharrem Köse, who in March 2016 was dishonorably discharged for reported association with Gülen, as the suspected leader of the coup.However, the Alliance for Shared Values, a non-profit organization associated with Gülen, released a statement reiterating that it condemns any military intervention in domestic politics, and saying Erdoğan\'s allegations against the movement were ""highly irresponsible"".Gülen himself said in a brief statement just before midnight: ""As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nReuters reported that in early hours of 16 July, the coup appeared to have ""crumbled"" as crowds defied pro-coup military orders and gathered in major squares of Istanbul and Ankara to oppose it.Reuters also reported pro-coup soldiers surrendering to the police in Taksim Square, Istanbul.It was reported that by 05:18, Atatürk airport had completely been recaptured by the government whilst the police had surrounded the coupists inside the Turkish army headquarters, calling for them to surrender.Between 06:00–08:00 a skirmish took place there.In Akar\'s absence, Ümit Dündar, head of the First Army, was appointed Acting Chief of Staff.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning of 16 July, soldiers blocking the Bosphorus Bridge surrendered to the police.According to the government-run Anadolu Agency, this consisted of a group of 50 soldiers.Some of these soldiers were lynched by civilians despite the police\'s efforts, who fired into the air to protect the surrendering soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile, in the headquarters of the Turkish Army, 700 unarmed soldiers surrendered as the police conducted an operation into the building while 150 armed soldiers were kept inside by the police.The coupists in the TRT building in Istanbul surrendered in the early morning as well.Chief of Staff Akar, held hostage at the Akıncı Air Base in Ankara, was also rescued by pro-state forces.\n\nOne of the primary reasons that the coup failed was chaos among the plotters\' ranks.Turkey\'s National Intelligence Organization (MİT) head Hakan Fidan discovered the coup plot, and the plotters were forced to execute the coup five hours ahead of schedule.One of the main organizers, General Semih Terzi, was shot dead by loyalist Sgt.Maj.Ömer Halisdemir at the onset, demoralizing and disrupting command and control of the rebels.These two incidents resulted in the coup being carried out in an uncoordinated manner.The highest ranking staff officers opposed the coup, and publicly ordered all personnel to return to their barracks.Acting outside the military chain of command, the rebels lacked the coordination and resources to achieve their goals.The conscripted soldiers that the rebels mobilized were uninformed of their mission\'s true purpose and became demoralized.Many surrendered rather than shoot demonstrators.The commander of the First Army in Istanbul, General Ümit Dündar, personally called Erdoğan to warn him of the plot, persuading him to evacuate his hotel ahead of the plotters, and helped to secure Istanbul for Erdoğan to land.The MİT also mobilized its anti-aircraft guns, which the plotters were unaware existed, deterring rebel jets and commando teams.\n\nEqually important to the coup\'s failure, according to military strategist Edward N. Luttwak, was the inability of the rebels to neutralize Erdoğan and other high ranking government officials, either by killing or detaining them.A unit of special forces was sent via helicopter to kill or capture the president, but missed because he had been evacuated by his security detail just minutes before.Once Erdoğan landed at Atatürk International Airport (which had been recaptured from the rebels by his supporters), It became highly unlikely that the coup attempt would succeed.According to a military source, several rebel F-16s targeted Erdoğan\'s presidential jet en route to Istanbul, but they did not fire.A senior Turkish counter-terrorism official later stated that the jets did not fire because the fighter jet pilots were told by President Erdoğan\'s pilot over the radio that the (flight of the) Gulfstream IV was a Turkish Airlines flight.\n\nAccording to Naunihal Singh, author of Seizing Power, the coup attempt also failed because the plotters failed to secure control of the media and shape the narrative.Successful coups require that the rebels control the mass media.This allows even small rebel contingents to portray themselves as fully in control, and their victory as inevitable.Consequently, they convince the public, along with neutral and even loyalist soldiers, to defect to them or not resist.The rebels failed to properly broadcast their messages effectively across the media that they controlled.They failed to capture Türksat, Turkey\'s main cable and satellite communications company, and failed to gain control of the country\'s television and mobile phone networks.This allowed Erdoğan to make his Facetime call, and to speak on television.\n\nOther scholars of civil-military relations, like Drew H. Kinney, have said reports like Luttwak and Singh\'s miss the point of their own analysis: civil resistance thwarted the coup.Luttwak argues that wayward elements of the Turkish armed forces could not silence Erdoğan.Singh says that the rebels could not project success because they couldn\'t control the message.Kinney states that neither of these reasons on their own matter, but rather it\'s their effect—civil disobedience—that is important.We might find that ""[Gülen\'s movement] ...[might] have had nothing to do with the attempted takeover in July, but civilians [nevertheless] definitely played a role in thwarting the coup,"" writes Kinney.""...[A]n unhappy civilian populace mobilized to face down the military.""\n\nErdoğan wasn\'t censored (Luttwak\'s point) and was therefore able to use FaceTime to mobilize resistance, which in turn hindered the conspirators\' ability to project success (Singh\'s point).The result is civilian resistance to soldiers, i.e., people power.The reason Singh, Luttwak, and other scholars of civil-military relations miss this is, according to Kinney, because they ""usually do not study extra-military reasons for coup failures/successes,"" but rather put a premium on ""the inner-workings of the [military] operation.""In short, they blame the military for its failure rather than acknowledge the power of the masses and their successes.\n\nPro-state forces sent text messages to every Turkish citizen calling for them to protest against the coup attempt.Throughout the night sela prayers were repeatedly called from mosque minarets across the country to encourage people to resist the coup plotters.While the sela is usually called from minarets to inform the public of a funeral, they are also traditionally performed to notify of a significant event, in this case ""to rally people"".\n\nThe coup plotters initiated their operation hours ahead of the planned time when they understood that their plans had been compromised.Had the coup been launched at its original time, the middle of the night, much of the population would have been asleep.The streets would have been mostly empty.\n\nReports have emerged, neither confirmed nor denied by Russia or Turkey that the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate intercepted signals on an imminent coup passed on to loyal Turkish operatives.The intercepted plans revealed several helicopters with commandos were on the way to Marmaris\'s coastal resort, where Erdoğan stayed, capturing or killing him.Pre-warned, Erdoğan left quickly to avoid them.\n\nAn extensive purge of the Turkish civil service began in the wake of the coup attempt, with President Erdoğan warning his opponents that ""they will pay a heavy price for this.""The New York Times along with some other Western media such as The Economist, described the purges as a ""counter-coup"", with the Times expecting the president to ""become more vengeful and obsessed with control than ever, exploiting the crisis not just to punish mutinous soldiers but to further quash whatever dissent is left in Turkey,"".As of 20 July 2016, the purge already had seen over 45,000 military officials, police officers, judges, governors and civil servants arrested or suspended, including 2,700 judges, 15,000 teachers, and every university dean in the country.\n\n163 generals and admirals were detained, around 45% of the Turkish military\'s total.\n\nOn 18 July 2016, United States State Secretary John Kerry urged Turkish authorities to halt the increasing crackdown on its citizens, indicating that the crackdown was meant to ""suppress dissent.""French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault voiced concern, warning against a ""political system which turns away from democracy"" in response to the purges.\n\nOn 17 August 2016, Turkey started releasing what was expected to eventually amount to about 38,000 prison inmates, to make more space in the penal system for detainees, numbering about 35,000, who were arrested or detained after being involved in or suspected of association, with the 2016 failed coup.\n\nOn 28 September 2016, Turkish justice minister Bekir Bozdağ said 70,000 people had been processed and 32,000 were formally arrested.\n\nMajor General Cahit Bakir, who commanded Turkish forces under NATO in Afghanistan, and Brigadier General Sener Topuc, responsible for education and aid in Afghanistan, were detained by authorities in Dubai connected with the failed coup.\n\nGeneral Akın Öztürk, former Commander of the Turkish Air Force, was the Turkish military attaché to Israel.He was arrested on charges of having played a leading role in the failed coup.Öztürk has denied the charges.\n\nGeneral Adem Huduti, the commander of the Second Army, positioned along the southern borders with Syria and Iraq, and General Erdal Öztürk, the commander of the 3rd Corps, were also arrested.\n\nRear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been stationed at NATO\'s Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk, Virginia, sought asylum in the United States after being recalled by the Turkish government.\n\nIn July 2018, Istanbul\'s 25th Criminal Court sentenced 72 former soldiers involved in the coup attempt to life in prison.\n\nOn 20 June 2019, a terrorism court in Turkey sentenced 151 people to life in prison, including General Akın Öztürk, former commander of Turkish Air Force and the most senior officer involved in the coup.128 people received ""aggravated life"" sentences, which indicates harsh conditions without parole, for their role in the coup, with another 23 receiving standard life sentences.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom President Erdoğan said as one of the principal conspirators, condemned the coup attempt and denied any role in it.""I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey,"" he said in an emailed statement reported by The New York Times.""Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force.I pray to God for Turkey, Turkish citizens, and all those currently in Turkey that this situation is resolved peacefully and quickly.As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nPresident Erdoğan asked the United States to extradite Gülen: ""I call on you again, after there was a coup attempt.Extradite this man in Pennsylvania to Turkey!If we are strategic partners or model partners, do what is necessary.""Prime Minister Yildirim has threatened war against any country that would support Gülen.Turkish Labor Minister Süleyman Soylu said that ""America is behind the coup.""\n\nRegarding the AKP\'s statement against Gülen, Secretary of State Kerry invited the Turkish government ""to present us with any legitimate evidence that withstands scrutiny,"" before they would accept an extradition request.\n\nOn 15 August 2016, former United States diplomat James Jeffrey, who was the United States ambassador to Turkey from 2008 until 2010 made the following remarks: ""The Gülen movement has some infiltration at the least in the military that I am aware of.They of course had extreme infiltration into the police and judiciary earlier.I saw that when I was in Turkey previously, particularly in the Sledgehammer case, Hakan Fidan case, and the corruption cases in 2013.Obviously, significant segment of Turkey\'s bureaucracy was infiltrated and had their allegiance to a movement.That of course is absolutely unacceptable and extremely dangerous.It likely led to the coup attempt.""\n\nOutside Turkey, in Beringen, Belgium, anti-coup protesters attempted to attack a building owned by the pro-Gülen movement group \'Vuslat\'.The police brought in a water cannon to keep the attackers at bay.In news articles it was stated that the police also protected the houses of Gülen supporters.People advocated on social media to go to Beringen once more, and there was unrest in Heusden-Zolder, elsewhere in Belgium.Furthermore, in Somalia the government ordered ""the total closure of all activities"" of an organization linked to the Gülen movement, and gave its staff seven days to leave the country.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, President Erdoğan said Western countries were ""supporting terrorism"" and the military coup, saying ""I\'m calling on the United States: what kind of strategic partners are we, that you can still host someone whose extradition I have asked for?""\n\nOn 31 January 2017, British Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, Alan Duncan said he believed the Gülen movement was responsible for the coup attempt.Duncan went on saying ""the organization which incorporated itself into the state tried to topple the democratic structure in Turkey"".\n\nIn a speech on 29 July 2016, President Erdoğan said U.S. Central Command chief Joseph Votel was ""siding with coup plotters""; Erdoğan said the United States was protecting Fethullah Gülen, whom the Turkish government blames for the coup attempt.Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim made similar comments.In response, Votel said that the Turkish government\'s statements were ""unfortunate and completely inaccurate"" and expressed concern that the mass arrests and firings of military officers would damage military cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey.Similarly, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said that the Turkish military purges were impairing the fight against ISIS.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, in an escalation of tensions with the United States, Erdoğan questioned Turkey\'s relationship with the United States and criticized the West, saying that ""script"" for the abortive putsch last month was ""written abroad"".Erdoğan stated that he had personally asked Obama to extradite Gülen to Turkey.When the U.S. government replied it would need evidence of the cleric\'s guilt before extradition, to which Erdoğan said: ""When you asked for the return of a terrorist, we did not ask for documentation. ...Let us put him on trial.""\n\nYeni Şafak daily, a Turkish pro-state newspaper, stated that the former commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, now-retired United States Army General John F. Campbell, was the ""mastermind"" behind the coup attempt in Turkey.Campbell called the statement ""absolutely ridiculous"" and President Obama said ""Any reports that we had any previous knowledge of a coup attempt, that there was any U.S. involvement in it, that we were anything other than entirely supportive of Turkish democracy are completely false, unequivocally false.""\n\nOn 1 December 2017, Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for American political analyst, former CIA official and former vice chairman of US National Intelligence Council Graham Fuller, stating his involvement in the coup.A career US State Department official who was once CIA Station Chief in Kabul and later went on to be a political scientist in Rand Corporation specializing in the Middle East, Turkish authorities said Fuller attended a meeting in Istanbul on 15 July 2016 involving organization and coordination of the botched coup.Another American among the attendance, as stated by the Turkish prosecutors, was academic Henri Barkey who was named a suspect a week after the failed coup.\n\nThe U.S. consulate in Turkey issued an advisory to U.S. citizens to avoid the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey, which houses about 50 nuclear bombs, until ""normal operations have been restored"".They stated that local authorities were denying access to the air base and that power supplying the air base was shut off.\n\nThe Incirlik base is important to the U.S.-led effort in Syria to combat ISIL and other militants.Nearly 1,500 American personnel are housed in the base.\n\nTwenty-four hours after initial reports that the air base was shut down, United States defense department officials confirmed that the base and its airspace had re-opened to military aircraft and that operations by American aircraft will resume.The Turkish commander of the air base, brig.Gen. Bekir Ercan Van was arrested.After the failure of the coup Gen Bekir Ercan Van sought asylum from the U.S., but his request was denied by U.S.\n\nFollowing the failed coup attempt multiple media outlets have published editorials advocating the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Incirlik Air base as Turkey is unstable.\n\nOn 16 July, anti-coup protesters chanted against locals in areas of Istanbul with high concentration of Alevis, including Okmeydanı and Gazi.Such incidents also occurred in a quarter of Antakya with a high Alevi population, where a motorcyclist stating to be a sharia advocate was lynched.In a neighbourhood of Ankara, shops belonging to Syrians were attacked by a mob.In Malatya, Sunni Islamists harassed residents of an Alevi neighbourhood, particularly the women, and attempted to enter the neighbourhood en masse.Police intervened and blocked all roads leading there.In Kadıköy, people drinking alcohol in public were attacked by a group of religious fundamentalists.\n\nFollowing the arrests, thousands of anti-coup protesters demanded instituting the death penalty against detainees connected with the coup, chanting ""we want the death penalty"".President Erdoğan has been open to reinstituting the death penalty, noting that ""in a democracy, whatever the people want they will get.""Turkish authorities have not executed anyone since 1984, but legally abolished capital punishment only in 2004 as a pre-condition to join the European Union.\n\nEuropean Union officials have been vocal about their opposition to purges by Turkish authorities in connection to the coup.French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that Turkey must work within the framework of the law to uphold Europe\'s democratic principles.Furthermore, on 18 July 2016, Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of Foreign Affairs of the European Union, announced that no country will be admitted into the European Union ""if it introduces the death penalty"".Moreover, German press secretary, Steffen Seibert, stated that reinstituting the death penalty will end Turkey\'s accession talks with the European Union.\n\nTurkey is a member of the Council of Europe, and ratified the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) as part of its terms of membership.The ECHR is an international treaty that includes the abolition of the death penalty among its terms.As such, Turkey is legally bound not to reintroduce the death penalty.\n\nOn 20 July 2016, President Erdoğan announced a three-month state of emergency in response to the attempted coup, invoking Article 120 of the Constitution of Turkey (""Declaration of state of emergency because of widespread acts of violence and serious deterioration of public order"").Under the state of emergency, under Article 121, ""the Council of Ministers, meeting under the chairpersonship of the President of the Republic, may issue decrees having the force of law on matters necessitated by the state of emergency"", with decrees subject to subsequent parliamentary approval.The state of emergency was endorsed by the Parliament on 21 July by 346 votes to 115.The Justice and Development Party and the Nationalist Movement Party supported the state of emergency, whilst the Republican People\'s Party and the Peoples\' Democratic Party opposed it.Prime Minister Yıldırım said at the Parliament that the state of emergency was necessary to ""get rid of this scourge rapidly"".\n\nAs part of the state of emergency, deputy prime minister Kurtulmuş announced that Turkey was temporarily suspending part of the European Convention on Human Rights following the attempted coup, invoking Article 15 of the Convention (""war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation"").The suspensions must be notified to the Council of Europe and may not affect the right to a fair trial or the prohibition on torture.\n\nThis state of emergency in Turkey as well as the hindrance of the right to protest that occurred within such framework have been layered onto a longer history of emergency rules, oppressive legislation and daily government practice that have reinforced both.We can see from this the ""autocratisation"" process in Turkey has thrived of existing legal framework deeply associated in legacies of past ""emergencies"".\n\nOn 3 October 2016 Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş declared the governments intention to extend the state of emergency by a further three months raising objections from both the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) and Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) were critical of the governments use of their emergency powers and declared that they would vote against an extension.\n\nFollowing the National Security Council\'s recommendation for the extension President Erdoğan stated that it was possible that the state of emergency could last for longer than a year prompting outcry from the opposition, Leader of the Main Opposition Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu said that ""The president saying that the state of emergency can last longer than 12 months is strengthening the fear of a counter-coup"" and that it was ""raising the prospect of opportunist measures.""\n\nThe AKP\'s governmental majority allowed the three-month extension to take effect on 19 October 2016.The two-year-long state of emergency was ended on 19 July 2018.\n\nOn 16 July 2016, the media reported that eight Turkish military personnel of various ranks had landed in Greece\'s northeastern city of Alexandroupolis on board a Black Hawk helicopter and claimed political asylum in Greece.While the Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu demanded extradition of ""the eight traitors as soon as possible"", the Greek authorities stated: ""We will follow the procedures of international law.However, we give severe considerations to the fact that [the Turkish military men] are accused, in their own country, of violating the constitutional order and trying to overthrow democracy.""The helicopter was returned to Turkey shortly thereafter.The eight asylum seekers, their asylum case pending, were later transferred to Athens, mainly for safety reasons.On 26 January, the Supreme Court of Greece eventually ruled against their extradition, on the grounds that the eight were unlikely to face a fair trial if returned to their home country and due to concerns over their safety.\n\nOn 15 February 2017, five Turkish commandos illegally entered Greece through the Evros river.However, once they entered the country, the group split.The two of them surrendered to the police and on 20 February 2017, requested political asylum.They were being held in the city of Alexandroupolis.The two men belonged to the Turkish navy.The names given by the two reportedly match the names of two fugitives wanted in relation to the shadowy operation against Erdoğan himself.The Greek government mentioned that the Greek authorities will not allow the country to be dragged into the ongoing feud between the Turkish state and the followers of Gulen.But there were no sign of the other three.According to a lawyer there were indications that the other three have been arrested by Greek authorities who were about to expel them to Turkey.According to new evidence and new information these three ""arrested"" marines were delivered under fast and informal procedures from Greek to Turkish services.\n\nAfter the coup attempt, two Turkish military attachés in Athens, Staff Col. İlhan Yaşıtlı and naval attaché Col. Halis Tunç, had reportedly disappeared along with their families.The Greek foreign ministry canceled the two attachés\' accreditations on 7 August 2016, upon the request of the Turkish foreign ministry.Greek media reported that they might have fled to Italy.On 11 August 2016, the Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu confirmed the reports saying that they had left Greece for Italy on 6 August and adding that Turkey would officially ask the Italian authorities to extradite the two soldiers.\n\nOn 9 August 2016, the media reported that Turkey\'s Rear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been on a United States-based assignment for NATO and after the coup was subject to a detention order in Turkey, had sought asylum in the United States.\n\nIn mid-November 2016, it was officially confirmed that about 40 Turkish military servicemen of various ranks stationed at NATO command structures had applied for asylum in Germany and Belgium.\n\nIn January 2017, Der Spiegel magazine and ARD broadcaster reported that about 40 mostly high-ranking Turkish soldiers who worked at NATO facilities in Germany requested asylum in Germany.\n\nAt the end of February 2017, Germany said it had received 136 asylum requests from Turks holding diplomatic passports since the July coup attempt.The figure was a total for August 2016 to January 2017; some were presumed to be military officers posted to NATO bases in Germany.\n\nIn November 2016, NATO\'s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that Turkish NATO Officers had requested asylum in the countries where they had been posted.He did not name the nations involved or the number of officers, saying it was a matter for those countries to decide.He said: ""Some Turkish officers working in NATO command structure ... have requested asylum in the countries where they are working. ...As always, this is an issue that is going to be assessed and decided by the different NATO allies as a national issue.""\n\nAs of March 2017, Norway have granted asylum for four Turkish soldiers and a military attache.\n\nSeveral Turkish citizens with diplomatic passports have sought political asylum in Switzerland.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, detainees in Turkey have been denied access to legal counsel, have been beaten and tortured.They have not been provided with adequate food, water, or medical care.At least one has attempted suicide.Amnesty International wanted the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture to send people to check on detainees conditions.A person who had been on duty at the Ankara police headquarters said that police denied medical treatment to a detainee.""Let him die.We will say he came to us dead,"" the witness quoted a police doctor as saying.\n\nAlso, Erdoğan has extended the maximum period of detention for suspects from four days to 30, a move Amnesty said increased the risk of torture or other maltreatment of detainees.\n\nTurkish Justice Ministry denied the reports and the Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said on his Twitter account: ""There has not been any torture or assault of detainees in custody,"" in response to reports by Amnesty International.""The claims of torture and assault make up a pre-packaged misinformation campaign formed by members of FETÖ, one which is untrue and distorted,""\n\nOn 7 August, between three and five million people gathered for an anti-coup rally organized by the Turkish authorities in Istanbul.President Erdoğan and the two leaders of the major opposition parties (the Republican People\'s Party and the Nationalist Movement Party) were present.\n\nGreek authorities on several Aegean islands have called for emergency measures to curtail a growing flow of refugees from Turkey; the number of migrants and refugees willing to make the journey across the Aegean has increased noticeably after the failed coup.At Athens officials voiced worries because Turkish monitors overseeing the deal in Greece had been abruptly pulled out after the failed coup without being replaced.Also, the mayor of Kos expressed concern in a letter to the Greek Prime Minister citing the growing influx of refugees and migrants after the failed coup.The Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises (SETE) warned about the prospect of another flare-up in the refugee/migrant crisis due to the Turkish political instability.\n\nVincent Cochetel, the director of the Europe Bureau of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in August 2016 that parts of the EU-Turkey deal about immigration were already de facto suspended because no Turkish police were present at Greek detention centres to oversee deportations.\n\nOn 25 August 2016, seven Turkish citizens sought asylum in Greece.Two were university professors, and their two children applied for asylum in Alexandroupoli after they illegally entered the country from the northeastern border.Also, three businessmen illegally reached the Greek island of Rhodes, and they also applied for asylum.\n\nOn 30 August 2016, a Turkish judge arrived at the Greek island of Chios on a migrant boat, with six Syrian nationals, and sought asylum in the country.He told the Greek coastguard and police officers that he is being persecuted in Turkey for his political beliefs by President Tayyip Erdoğan.The Turkish judge had been arrested for illegally entering the country and was transferred to Athens for his asylum proceedings.The Syrian nationals claimed refugee status.\n\nOn 11 September 2016, four Turkish civilians were arrested by Turkish police.An academic and a teacher attempted to escape to Greece illegally by crossing the Evros river, and the other two because they organized the escape attempt.The academic and the teacher paid a total of 12,500 euros in Istanbul to arrange their escape to Greece.Before their attempt, both the academic and the teacher were suspended from their duties as part of the ongoing probe into the failed coup attempt.Police also seized an air raft, an oar and a pump while detaining the suspects.The court later ordered the two\'s release while the other two suspects, who organized the escape attempt, were arrested.\n\nOn 21 September 2016, ten Turkish civilians, two men, two women and six children landed by boat illegally on the Greek island of Rhodes and sought asylum.They told the Greek authorities they were working in the private sector in Turkey and the Turkish government was persecuting them due to their political beliefs.\n\nOn 29 September 2016, five Turkish nationals, a couple and their child and two other men, arrived in Greece, at Alexandroupolis by crossing the Evros River by boat illegally and requested political asylum.\n\nOn 12 December 2016, one female Turkish national, landed by boat, full of refugees and immigrants, illegally on the Greek island of Lesbos.She requested political asylum.\n\nOn 24 October 2017, Turkish authorities obtained information that 995 Turks have applied for asylum in Greece after the coup attempt.\n\nMore than 1,800 Turkish citizens requested asylum in Greece in 2017.\n\nOn 18 February 2018, seventeen Turkish nationals, including six children, requested asylum in Greece at Oinousses island.\n\nIn August 2018, the former lawmaker for the Peoples\' Democratic Party, Leyla Birlik, requested asylum in Greece after illegally crossing the border near Alexandroupolis.\n\nBerlin mayor, Michael Müller (SPD), said Turkey was waging war on supporters of the Gülen movement in Germany.He said that Turkish officials had approached him and asked him whether he would be prepared to confront the Gülen movement in Berlin critically and, if necessary, to support measures against it.The mayor rejected the idea and made it very clear that Turkish conflicts could not be waged in the city.\n\nDer Spiegel presented classified documents, which showed that Turkey\'s secret service (MIT) had asked Germany\'s foreign intelligence agency (BND) for help in rounding up Gülen supporters in Germany.The Turkish secret service wanted the BND to use its influence to spur German lawmakers into taking action against Gülen supporters and extraditing them to Turkey.Also, Turkey\'s government has sent German authorities requests for searches and extraditions linked to supporters of Fethullah Gülen in Germany.\n\nIn Germany businesses thought to be in support of the Gülen movement have been harassed by Erdoğan supporters.\n\nAfter the failed coup, there was a massive demonstration in Cologne at Germany, in late July, in support of Turkish President Erdoğan.Erdoğan wanted to address the participants via video but was rejected by the local authorities and the German Constitutional Court due to security concerns.Turkey said that the ban was unacceptable and a violation of freedom of expression.\n\nGerman authorities said Turkish mosques in Germany were playing Turkish politics and worried that Turkey\'s internal politics spilled over into German cities.For years, German authorities had encouraged Turkey\'s state-run religious institution Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs usually referred to as DİTİB to provide Islamic preachers and teachers and Gülen Movement Schools for the large Turkish diaspora in Germany.DİTİB manages some 900 mosques in Germany.Gülen movement runs 100 educational facilities in Germany.\n\nAfter the failed coup DİTİB published a sermon praising ""our noble nation"" for rising against ""a wretched network"" that had sown ""seeds of sedition, rebellion and hostility.""According to Volker Beck, a member of the center-left Greens in Germany\'s Bundestag, ""That was not a religious text.It was a declaration of obedience to Mr. Erdoğan and his measures since the coup attempt,"" Volker Kauder, parliamentary group leader of the Germany\'s ruling Christian Democrats, the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU)/Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) faction, said Turkish-Germans should be loyal to Germany first and foremost.\n\nGermans of Turkish origin are being pressured in Germany by informers and officers of Turkey\'s MIT spy agency.According to reports Turkey had 6,000 informants plus MIT officers in Germany who were putting pressure on ""German Turks"".Hans-Christian Ströbele said that there was an ""unbelievable"" level of ""secret activities"" in Germany by Turkey\'s MIT agency.According to Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, not even the former communist East German Stasi secret police had managed to run such a large ""army of agents"" in the former West Germany: ""Here, it\'s not just about intelligence gathering, but increasingly about intelligence service repression.""\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nGermany\'s Office for Migration and Refugees said on 18 November 2016, it had received 4,437 political asylum requests from Turkish citizens up to October, compared to 1,767 for the whole of last year.""We must expect that the number of Turks who are seeking political asylum in Germany will continue to rise,"" said Stephan Mayer, the domestic policy speaker of the union coalition in the Bundestag.\n\nOn 10 December 2016, eleven Turkish nationals, 10 adults and one child, in a martial arts group have applied for asylum in Germany.\n\nAs of January 2018, Germany was first place and Greece second as EU destinations of choice for Turkish nationals requesting asylum after the coup attempt.\n\nTurkish police have carried out simultaneous raids in 18 cities against companies associated with United States-based Fethullah Gülen.The state-run Anadolu Agency said police searched 204 premises and detained 187 businessmen for ""membership in a terror organization"" and ""providing financial support to a terror organization"".All suspects\' assets were seized.\n\nWikiLeaks released Turkish emails and documents to respond to the Turkish government\'s purges that followed the coup attempt.In turn, the Turkish Telecommunications Communications Board blocked access to the WikiLeaks website.On 17 July 2016 Wikileaks had announced on Twitter, the leak of approximately 300,000 emails and over 500,000 documents, including those to and from AKP.\n\nWikiLeaks stated that it was attacked shortly after 17 July announcement of the planned publication and hypothesized that Turkish authorities were responsible.WikiLeaks stated in a tweet, ""our infrastructure is under sustained attack.""Tweets from WikiLeaks include ""We are unsure of the true origin of the attack.The timing suggests a Turkish state power faction or its allies.We will prevail & publish.""and: ""Turks will likely be censored to prevent them reading our pending release of 100k+ docs on politics leading up to the coup."", ""We ask that Turks are ready with censorship bypassing systems such as TorBrowser and uTorrent""; ""And that everyone else is ready to help them bypass censorship and push our links through the censorship to come.""\n\nUpon the release of the email dump, it has been reported that the emails contain little to no damning information, and instead are just mails from a public mailing list, but also linked externally to ""voter information on all of the women registered to vote in 78 out of Turkey\'s 81 provinces"".\n\nSeveral places were renamed to commemorate the failed coup: Boğaziçi Köprüsü (Bosphorus Bridge) → 15 Temmuz Şehitler Köprüsü Kızılay Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Kızılay Demokrasi Meydanı Ahmet Taner Kışlalı Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Milli İrade Meydanı (Reverted to original name a few days later) Büyük İstanbul Otogarı → İstanbul 15 Temmuz Demokrasi Otogarı In TRT, Yeni Haber Stüdyosu → 15 Temmuz Millet Stüdyosu Kazan → Kahramankazan about the province\'s local people\'s resistance to the coup plotters.Kahraman means ""hero"" in Turkish Niğde University → Niğde Ömer Halisdemir University\n\nIn 2018, the Istanbul Municipal Council decided to change the names of a total of 90 streets that included words which could be associated with FETÖ.\n\nThe Presidency of Religious Affairs stated that it would not be providing religious funeral services to the dead coupists, except for ""privates and low-ranking officers compelled by force and threats who found themselves in the midst of the conflict without full knowledge of anything"".\n\nA document dated 26 September 2016 showed that Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) asked Turkish missions and religious representatives abroad to profile Gülen movement expatriates living in their respective foreign countries.Gülen-linked schools, businesses, foundations, associations, media outlets and others were also included in the reports.Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs has gathered intelligence via imams from 38 countries.\n\nBelgium officials said they would withdraw recognition of Diyanet mosques in the country if necessary.\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nOn 21 December 2016, the Turkish government has recalled Yusuf Acar, the religious affairs attaché of the Turkish Embassy in the Netherlands, after Dutch authorities said he was spying.Acar collected information of people who sympathize with Fethullah Gülen at Netherlands and passed it on to the Turkish authorities.The Dutch government called spying activities an ""unwanted and non-acceptable interference in the lives of Dutch citizens.""and the attaché was reportedly declared persona non grata and received a ""deportation warning"" by Dutch authorities.\n\nOn 26 January 2017, President Erdoğan, during his visit to Tanzania, asked his Tanzanian counterpart John Magufuli to take action against the network of Fethullah Gülen.\n\nIn April 2017 it was announced that President Erdoğan planned to establish a purpose-built museum dedicated to the coup events, called the ""Museum of the 15 July: Martyrs and Democracy"", to be located in Kahramankazan, a town near Ankara.Paid for by Turkish Ministry of Culture funds, it is planned to open at the end of 2018.The museum opened in December 2019\n\nAmong the Turkish opposition parties, the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) issued a statement expressing their public opposition to the coup, and the Hürriyet Daily News reported that Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bahçeli telephoned Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım to express his opposition to the coup.The co-chairs of the opposition Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) issued a statement saying that the party was ""under all circumstances and as a matter of principle against all kinds of coup.""Amongst the minor parties, left-wing nationalist Patriotic Party\'s Doğu Perinçek backed democracy, when he held Gülen and the Americans responsible.Kurdish militant separatist organization Kurdistan Workers\' Party, which Turkey and its allies label as a terrorist organization, urged their supporters to stay away from the coup and rather defend their people, while the Communist Party called upon the people to overthrow the AKP government which they called an ""enemy of humanity"".\n\nDuring the first hours of the coup plotters\' moves of blocking Istanbul\'s bridges and flying fighter jets low over Istanbul and Ankara, Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjørn Jagland tweeted against the coup attempt and underlined that ""any attempt to overthrow the democratically elected leaders is unacceptable"".\n\nRussia\'s President Vladimir Putin called Erdoğan out of solidarity before all NATO member countries\' heads following the coup attempt.Erdoğan thanked the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev – who was the first president to show solidarity after the coup attempt – for his support in solving the 7-month crisis over downed Russian Sukhoi Su-24 and the Prime Minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, who was among the first NATO country leaders to condemn the coup attempt, already from the early hours of Saturday.\n\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the then prime minister of Pakistan, was all praise for the people of Turkey and the AKP government and strongly condemned what he termed as an attempt to undermine democracy in Turkey.""We deeply admire the resolve of the brave and resilient Turkish people, who stood up against the forces of darkness and anarchy to express their support and commitment to democracy,"" the PM said in a statement issued from his office.\n\nThe majority of countries either expressed their support for the government or called for restraint.On 16 July 2016, however, a proposed United Nations Security Council statement denouncing the coup was not accepted by Egypt, a non-permanent member of the Council at the time, due to textual disagreements.Egyptian diplomats said that the council is ""in no position to qualify, or label [the Turkish] government – or any other government for that matter – as democratically elected or not"".Objection by the United States and the UK – permanent members of the Security Council – led to Egypt proposing a new statement calling for all sides to ""respect the democratic and constitutional principles and the rule of law"", which was rejected, preventing the condemnation of the coup attempt by the Security Council.The leader of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky supported the coup attempt.\n\nAl-Monitor reported that ""Unlike Ankara\'s Western allies, Iran did not wait for the coup\'s failure to speak up.Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif voiced support for democracy in a Twitter message in the early hours of the unrest, writing ""Stability, and democracy in Turkey are paramount"".In a subsequent phone call after the failure of the coup attempt, President Hassan Rouhani told Erdoğan the coup attempt was ""a test to identify your domestic and foreign friends and enemies.""An Iranian official pointed out parallels between the coup attempt in Turkey and the coup against Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mussadiq in 1953: ""What we know is that this attempt was triggered by foreign hands.We have experienced the same thing in the past.Since Mr. Erdogan wants to play a more positive path in the region today, they want to overthrow him.""\n\nMustafa Akıncı, President of Northern Cyprus, welcomed the fact that ""no community in Turkey ... applauded the coup as they have done in the past.""Azerbaijan strongly condemned the attempted military coup in Turkey and considered such actions unacceptable according to a statement from Novruz Mammadov, deputy head of the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration and chief of the foreign relations department.\n\nEuropean Commissioner dealing with Turkey\'s EU membership bid, Johannes Hahn, said it appears Turkey\'s government prepared arrest lists of political opponents before the coup attempt and had been waiting for the right time to act.In this sense, EU reported that as a main criticism to put this issue in the category of terrorism become the violation of the fundamental rights and fundamental values of the citizens.Hence, it underlines a total divergence of opinions and mentality between EU and Turkey which reached a deadlock here especially after the 15th of July in 2016.\n\nOn 19 July 2016, White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said during a press briefing that President Barack Obama has held a phone conversation with President Erdoğan: ""The President used the phone call to reiterate once again the strong commitment of the United States to the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey.The President pledged any needed assistance to the Turkish government as they conduct an investigation to determine exactly what happened.""\n\nOn 20 July 2016, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""Turkey has a large armed force, professional armed forces and ...I am certain they will continue as a committed and strong NATO ally.""On a statement released on 10 August 2016, the Secretary General once more strongly condemned the attempted coup and reiterated full support for Turkey\'s democratic institutions.He also expressed support for the elected Turkish government and respect for the courage of the Turkish people for resisting the coup plotters.\n\nOn 29 July 2016, the commander of U.S. Central Command, General Joseph Votel, denied statements by Turkey\'s president Erdoğan that he has supported the coup attempt in Turkey.\n\nOn 1 August 2016, United States Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, General Joseph Dunford, visited Turkey and condemned the coup attempt.Dunford said: ""The consistent theme throughout the day was a reaffirmation of the importance of the U.S.-Turkey relationship – the need for us to cooperate.""\n\nOn July, 20, there were reports that a group of Turkish military commandos coup fugitives would try to cross from Turkey to the island of Symi, in the southeastern Aegean, at Greece.The Hellenic Coast Guard was on alert and increased the patrols in the area, especially after a group of inflatable dinghies and other vessels were seen departing from Datça, on the Turkish coast, in the direction of Symi, they monitored the movements of the Turkish vessels, which remained in Turkish waters.Furthermore, a contingent of the Hellenic Police was dispatched to Symi to conduct checks there.The Greek government had been anticipating a possible attempt by participants in the failed coup to come to Greece and took the reports seriously.Turkish F-16 fighter jets were also scrambled to check reports that missing Turkish coast guard vessels had appeared in Greek waters in the Aegean.Later on the day, the Turkish interior ministry denied reports that rebel soldiers might have ""hijacked"" a vessel to flee to Greece.The Greek armed forces remained on alert the throughout the day for potential coup fugitives.\n\nAccording to Michael Rubin, from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Erdoğan had himself to blame for the coup.Following an increasingly Islamist agenda, Erdoğan had reportedly ""dropped any pretense of governing for all Turks.""After ""fanning the flames"" at the 2013 Gezi Park protests, he transformed the predominantly Kurdish-inhabited areas of southeastern Turkey ""into a war zone reminiscent of the worst days of the 1980s.""The biggest problem, according to Rubin, might have been Erdoğan\'s foreign policy, which managed to turn the initial ""no problems with neighbors"" doctrine into a situation where the country has problems with almost every neighbor and has even alienated some of its allies and friends.Rubin previously worked as an official at the Pentagon and less than 4 months before the coup, he wrote an article in Newsweek magazine titled, ""Will There Be a Coup Against Erdogan in Turkey?""\n\nBritish Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk warned that ""too late did Erdoğan realize the cost of the role he had chosen for his country.It\'s one thing to say sorry to Putin and patch up relations with Netanyahu; but when you can no longer trust your army, there are more serious matters to concentrate upon.""Even if this coup may have failed, Fisk expected another to follow in the months or years to come.\n\nTurkish professor Akın Ünver described the coup d\'état attempt as ""more of a mutiny"".\n\nThe name of the ""Peace at Home Council"" – Yurtta Sulh Konseyi – is derived from Atatürk\'s famous saying \'Peace at Home, Peace in the World\'.Journalist Ezgi Başaran said that ""the statement of the junta, that was [...] read on the [...] government TV [channel] as the coup got under way, bore a strong resemblance to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk\'s famous address to the Turkish Youth.[...] On the other hand, given that these references are too obvious, they may have been intentionally included to insinuate a Kemalist junta rather than a Gülenist one.""\n\nThe citizen journalism site Bellingcat published an analysis of the messages of a WhatsApp group consisting of high-ranking military officials who had taken part in the coup covering their activities including them killing several people.The messages were cross referenced with video footage.The group was named ""Yurtta sulh"" which refers to a peace at home speech and they seem secular and military with no references to Gülen or anything related during the several hours of messaging.\n\nNews reports have suggested that the coup ringleader was Adil Öksüz.Some believe Öksüz to have been an operative with Turkish intelligence.\n\nGerman Islamic studies scholar said the putschists tried to forestall a large-scale purge of judiciary and military, the implementation of which had already started on Saturday, the day after the coup attempt.According to Turkish investigative journalist Ahmet Şık, a list of officials to be purged had been ready compiled by the attorney-general of Izmir, Okan Bato, and was approved by President Erdoğan.According to this version, the putschists had to quickly bring forward their coup attempt before being disposed and arrested.\n\nDuring and after the events, several politicians and commentators suggested that the government knew about the coup in advance and possibly directed it.The facts that the coup attempt began in the evening rather than at a more inconspicuous time and that the events were largely confined to Ankara and Istanbul contributed to doubts about the authenticity of the coup attempt.Journalists and opposition politicians branded it a \'tragic comedy\' and \'theatre play\'.Advocates of such theories pointed to how Erdoğan stood to gain from the coup attempt in terms of increasing his popularity and support for his calls for an executive presidency, while being able to legitimize further crackdowns on judicial independence and the opposition in general.\n\nOther elements that were reported to support the theory included: no list of demands by the coup plotters, the organization and response of the police, the long lists of arrests that seemed to be ready surprisingly quickly (including arrests of 2,745 judges and 2,839 soldiers), and the obvious nature of the coup actions.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom Erdoğan had said as being one of the principal conspirators, commented, ""I don\'t believe that the world believes the accusations made by President Erdoğan.There is a possibility that it could be a staged coup and it could be meant for further accusations [against the Gülenists].""Journalist Cengiz Çandar, a veteran observer of Turkey\'s coups, said ""I have never seen any with this magnitude of such inexplicable sloppiness.""Prominent Hizmet (Gülen movement) spokesman Alp Aslandogan said, referencing that the Turkish Air Force commander met with Erdoğan before 15 July, that certain legal documentation related to the coup seemed written beforehand, arguing that within ""the indictment written by a prosecutor on the night of 15 July to 16 July, there were events there that didn\'t actually happen.Some events did happen, but those events didn\'t happen by the time the document started.It looks like a bigger plan was there, and part of the plan did not come to pass.""\n\nThe organization and spontaneous synchronization by large numbers of mosques was perceived to be unachievable unless there had been prior preparation, with journalists also pointing to how Erdoğan could have strategically used the call to prayer to invoke religious sentiment in a political situation as a veiled attack on state secularism.\n\nThousands of arrests and purges were conducted by Turkish authorities between 16 and 18 July 2016.The sheer number of these arrests made at such a speed could only be done so if the ""Turkish government had all those lists ready"", as suggested by Johannes Hahn, European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, on 18 July 2016.Hahn also said that because these lists were already available immediately after the coup, the ""event was prepared"" and the lists were to be used ""at a certain stage"".\n\nMehmet Dişli, who was seen giving orders to the coup plotters and who was the one who put a belt around Hulusi Akar\'s neck to make him sign, is the brother of Şaban Dişli, a former vice president of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and confidant of Erdoğan.\n\nSeveral social media users have compared the coup attempt to the Reichstag fire in 1933, which Adolf Hitler used as an excuse to suspend civil liberties and order mass arrests of his opponents.Politico correspondent Ryan Heath said that ""the coup was staged to allow Erdoğan to purge the military of opponents and increase his grip on the country"".Heath used Twitter to share comments from his Turkish source, who called the events of Friday night a ""fake coup"" which would help a ""fake democracy warrior"" (referring to Erdoğan).The source said: ""Probably we\'ll see an early election [in] which he\'ll try to guarantee an unbelievable majority of the votes.And this will probably guarantee another 10–15 years of authoritarian, elected dictatorship.""\n\nThe New York Times reported that some Turkish citizens believed the coup attempt was staged by Erdoğan to improve his public image and popularity, while cracking down on political opponents and expanding his power.Critics found it suspect that reportedly no government officials were arrested or harmed during the attempted coup, which—among other factors—raised the suspicion of a false flag event staged by the Turkish government to crack down on opposition parties.Those in Turkey suggesting that the coup was staged are also being questioned by the government.\n\nPoliticians and journalists who were skeptical of the authenticity of the coup plot said that in reality, a \'civil coup\' had effectively been staged against the Armed Forces and Judiciary, both of which were extensively purged of stated Gülen supporters by the government shortly after the events.Skeptics said that the coup would be used as an excuse for further erosion of judicial independence and a crackdown on the opposition, giving the AKP greater and unstoppable power over all state institutions and paving the way for a more radical Islamist agenda at odds with the founding principles of the Turkish Republic.\n\nJustice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said in late July 2016 that Turkish social media users who said the government was staging the coup faced investigation: ""Just look at the people who are saying on social media that this was theatre.Public prosecutors are already investigating them.Most of them are losers who think it is an honor to die for Fethullah Gülen\'s command.""\n\nOn 12 July 2017, Stockholm Center for Freedom, a monitoring group with reported links to the Gülen movement, published a controversial report stating that President Erdogan orchestrated the coup bid as a false flag to consolidate his powers, set up his opposition for a mass persecution, and push Turkish Armed Forces into a military incursion into Syria.According to the report, it uncovered new evidence from 11 July 2016, four days before the planned coup bid, that a secret plan was circulated among select group of Armed Forces to give an appearance of a coup attempt.The plan was sanctioned by intelligence and military chiefs with the approval of Erdogan.\n\nIn early November 2017, Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for , former Director of the Middle East Program of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, stating that he is an agent of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), that he was present in Istanbul during the 2016 Turkish coup attempt, and that he was one of the key organizers behind the coup attempt.Around 1 December, the Istanbul prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for Graham E. Fuller, an American author and political analyst specializing in Islamic extremism after a long CIA career and holding the role of vice-chair of the United States National Intelligence Council.The prosecutor\'s office based the warrant on suspicion of Fuller helping to plan the coup attempt.Hürriyet stated that Turkish authorities believed that they had traced Fuller\'s location before the attempted coup and afterward when he left Turkey.\n\nBarkey denied his reported role in the coup, describing the claims as ""so ludicrous that they do not even deserve the term \'science fiction\'.""\n\nDeep state in Turkey The Imam\'s Army List of coups and coup attempts since 2010 List of modern conflicts in the Middle East List of attacks on legislatures\n', 'Claim_Context': 'In March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.

111,"{'Wiki_Title': '2016 Turkish coup attempt', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'On 15 July 2016, a faction within the Turkish Armed Forces, organized as the Peace at Home Council, attempted a coup d\'état against state institutions, including the government and president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.They attempted to seize control of several places in Ankara, Istanbul, Marmaris and elsewhere, such as the Asian side entrance of the Bosphorus Bridge, but failed to do so after forces and civilians loyal to the state defeated them.The Council cited an erosion of secularism, elimination of democratic rule, disregard for human rights, and Turkey\'s loss of credibility in the international arena as reasons for the coup.The government said it had evidence the coup leaders were linked to the Gülen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the Republic of Turkey and led by Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish businessman and a well-known Islamic scholar who lives in exile in Pennsylvania.The Turkish government alleged that Gülen was behind the coup (which Gülen denied) and that the United States was harboring him.Events surrounding the coup attempt and the purges in its aftermath reflect a complex power struggle between Islamist elites in Turkey.\n\nDuring the coup attempt, over 300 people were killed and more than 2,100 were injured.Many government buildings, including the Turkish Parliament and the Presidential Palace, were bombed from the air.Mass arrests followed, with at least 40,000 detained, including at least 10,000 soldiers and 2,745 judges, for being affiliated with the coup attempt.15,000 education staff were also suspended and the licenses of 21,000 teachers working at private institutions were revoked after the government stated they were loyal to Gülen.More than 77,000 people have been arrested and over 160,000 fired from their jobs, on reports of connections to Gülen.\n\nThere were many reactions against the coup attempt, both domestically and internationally.The main opposition parties in Turkey condemned the attempt, while several international leaders—such as those of the United States, NATO, the European Union, and neighboring countries—called for ""respect of the democratic institutions in Turkey and its elected officials.""Many international organizations also opposed the coup.The United Nations Security Council, however, did not denounce the coup after disagreements over the phrasing of a statement.Iran opposed the coup and advised Erdogan to defeat the coup plotters.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the head of United States Central Command, General Joseph Votel, was ""siding with coup plotters"", after Votel criticized the Turkish government for arresting the Pentagon\'s contacts in Turkey.\n\nIn March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.The same month, the British Parliament\'s Foreign Affairs Select Committee said some Gulenists were involved in the coup d\'état attempt but found no hard evidence that Fethullah Gülen masterminded the failed coup and found no evidence to justify the United Kingdom designating the Gülen movement as a ""terrorist organization"".\n\nSince the 1970s, followers of the influential cleric Fethullah Gülen had assumed increasingly important positions within the Turkish state apparatus.Gülen several times advised his followers to take key positions in society and government, if necessary with a secret identity to avoid opposition from the laicistic Turkish army and government.Nevertheless, at the start of the 21st century, Gülen\'s followers achieved crucial positions of power in Turkey (and beyond) with a vast network of newspapers, TV channels, schools, associations, lobby organizations, financial institutions and positions within the state such as the army and the judiciary.Initially, the then Prime Minister Erdogan seemingly tolerated the power of the Gülen movement because of common interests such as limiting the undemocratic political power of the military, but also because of impotence and fear of Gülen\'s power within Turkey.\n\nA series of events eventually led to a rift between Erdogan and Gülen.For example, prosecutors that allegedly were aligned with the Gülen movement tried to arrest the intelligence chief Hakan Fidan for the peace negotiations with the PKK, and by extension PM Erdogan subsequently, as the Turkish secret service is directly subordinate to the prime minister of Turkey.During this period (2010-2013), state secrets were leaked, fraud was committed with the entrance exams for government employees (KPSS), a change of power occurred at the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) and (sex)tapes of both government members and opposition members were leaked.Following these events and other incidents, the Turkish government decided to designate the Gülen movement as parallel state and FETÖ (Fethullahist Terror Organization).Alleged Gülen supporters were fired or arrested.The coup attempt that followed is therefore also described by some analysts as a last desperate attempt by Gülenists to retain power.\n\nIt is widely reported that Kemalist ideology played a huge role in motivating the 15 July 2016 coup attempt, like all previous political interventions in the history of Turkey\'s military coups.Since the establishment of multiparty democracy in Turkey in 1946, the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), together with the judiciary, have viewed themselves as guardians of Kemalist ideals and the secular Turkish nationalist state established under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk against political parties that have promoted a larger role for Islam and minorities in public life.The military and judiciary have regularly intervened in politics to block or ban popular parties representing conservative Muslim Turks, attempting to relax the restrictions on traditional religious practices, such as women\'s wearing of headscarves.The military has toppled four elected governments: by coups in 1960 and 1980, and by military decisions in 1971 and 1997.The military has also banned several major political parties.In 1998, Erdoğan, then-mayor of Istanbul, was banned for life from politics and jailed because he had read a religious poem by Ziya Gökalp several years before, at a public meeting.In 2007, the military expressed its opposition to the election of Abdullah Gül, of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), as president, by issuing an e-memorandum.Still, Gül was eventually elected when the AKP won both a referendum on the matter.Also, a snap election, and the party returned with a larger majority in the parliament.The military cited erosion of secularism as one of the reasons for the coup in the statement published on the day of the coup.\n\nAs opposed to previous political interventions by the Turkish military, Turkey\'s AKP government and pro-state media maintain that the 15 July 2016 coup attempt was not motivated by allegiance to Kemalist ideology, but rather to the vast political, economic, and religious network led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen.Between 2007 and 2012, high-profile Kemalists, including high-ranking officers of the Turkish Armed Forces, faced a series of trials and purges, under reports of involvement in a secret society codenamed ""Ergenekon.""Supported by Islamist (both pro-Gülen and pro-Erdoğan) prosecutors, security officials, and media, the purges allowed lower-rank Islamist officers to assume high-ranking military positions.They were seen as a bid by Turkey\'s civilian leaders under President Erdoğan to establish dominance over the military.In these trials in 2013 – viewed as ""sensational"" and ""one of the biggest in recent Turkish history"" – 275 people, including senior military officers, journalists, lawyers, and academics, were said to be involved in the so-called ""Ergenekon"" conspiracy, reportedly plotting a coup in 2003/04 against then–Prime Minister Erdoğan.Additionally, some military officers were said to be involved in a separate reported plot, Sledgehammer.Simultaneously, Erdoğan promoted lower-ranking officers up the chain of command, ensuring that the military chief of staff was loyal to him and thereby demoralizing the army.\n\nThe AKP\'s alliance with Gülen started to collapse during 2013 as Gülenists targeted the AKP using corruption charges.After the split, Erdoğan decided it would be advantageous to rehabilitate the army.The ""Ergenekon"" convictions were overturned in April 2016 by the Court of Cassation, which ruled that the existence of the network was unproven.\n\nIn 2013, law enforcement efforts to fight corruption, which had led to the 2013 corruption scandal in Turkey, were faulted by Erdoğan.The anti-corruption efforts were a source of tension between the Gülenists and the AKP.In political analysis in the months prior to the coup attempt, the incidence of corruption was reported to be ""rife"" in Turkey.Following the coup attempt, some coup leaders cited corruption as a reason for their actions.\n\nOn 13 July, less than two days before the coup was launched, Erdoğan signed a bill giving Turkish soldiers immunity from prosecution while taking part in domestic operations.The bill requires cases against commanders to be approved by the prime minister, while district governors may sign cases against lower-ranking soldiers.The immunity bill was seen as part of the détente between the government and the armed forces.The latter has increasingly been taking over military operations in Kurdish-inhabited areas from police and paramilitary units.\n\nOn 15 July 2016, as reported just before 23:00 EEST (UTC+3), military jets were spotted flying over Ankara, and both the Fatih Sultan Mehmet and Bosphorus bridges in Istanbul were closed.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said military action was being ""taken outside the chain of command"" and it was an ""illegal attempt"" to seize power by ""part of the military"".He further said that those involved ""will pay the highest price.""Local media also reported tanks in Istanbul\'s Atatürk Airport.It was reported that Internet users within Turkey were blocked from accessing Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.Twitter later stated that it had ""no reason to think we\'ve been fully blocked"".Some hostages were taken at military headquarters, including the Turkish Chief of the General Staff Hulusi Akar.At around 21:00, the coupists had invited Salih Zeki Çolak, the commander of the Turkish Land Forces to the military headquarters.When he arrived, he was immediately apprehended.Abidin Ünal, head of the Turkish Air Force, who had been attending a wedding in Istanbul, was abducted from there by soldiers who descended from a helicopter.The coupists then tried to force Akar to sign the coup declaration, almost strangling him using a belt in the process.He refused and was then taken to the Akıncı Air Base and other commanders at the headquarters.The military also entered the Justice and Development Party\'s offices in Istanbul and asked people to leave.\n\nEarly reports said President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was safe in Marmaris, south-west Turkey, where he had been on holiday.\n\nFrom around 23:00 to midnight, helicopters bombed the police special forces headquarters and police air force headquarters in Gölbaşı, just outside of Ankara.The attacks left 42 dead and 43 injured.Türksat headquarters in Gölbaşı was also attacked, killing two security personnel.\n\nAt around 23:50, soldiers occupied Taksim Square in central Istanbul.\n\nAt 00:02, it was reported by Reuters that soldiers were inside the buildings of the state broadcaster, the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), in Ankara.During the coup attempt, soldiers forced anchor Tijen Karaş to read out a statement saying that ""the democratic and secular rule of law has been eroded by the current government"" and that Turkey was now led by the Peace at Home Council who would ""ensure the safety of the population.""The statement read in part: ""Turkish Armed Forces have completely taken over the administration of the country to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedoms, the rule of law and general security that was damaged.[...] All international agreements are still valid.We hope that all of our good relationships with all countries will continue.""The plotters said they had ""done so to preserve democratic order, and that the rule of law must remain a priority"".The statement also ordered temporary martial law (sıkıyönetim), and said a new constitution would be prepared ""as soon as possible"".TRT was then taken off air.\n\nOther media outlets were also raided by the putschists, such as Turkish newspaper Hürriyet and private broadcaster CNN Türk.\n\nReuters reported on 15 July that an EU source described the coup as ""well orchestrated,"" and predicted that ""given the scale of the operation, it is difficult to imagine they will stop short of prevailing.""Another EU diplomat said that the Turkish ambassador in his capital was shocked and ""taking it very seriously"".\n\nThe Peace at Home Council was reportedly chaired by Muharrem Köse.\n\nAdana: Upon receiving the intelligence that thirty soldiers from the 10th Air Base Command would move to the base where the regional and provincial gendarmerie commands were located, the police prevented the soldiers from leaving the guardhouse with TOMA and armored vehicles and blocked them.Bitlis: In the Tatvan district of Bitlis, on the orders of Brigade Commander Arif Seddar Afşar, helicopters were circulated in the skies of Tatvan and fired at the city.The brigade command left the municipality\'s construction equipment in front of the barracks in case there was a tank operation in the district.Denizli: Approximately five hundred officers and non-commissioned officers who participated in the coup attempt surrendered to the gendarmerie and police forces.They were interrogated at Çardak District Gendarme Command.Kars: With the order of Kars 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, the soldiers who came with tanks and armored personnel carriers surrounded the Police Headquarters building and wanted to detain Faruk Karaduman, the chief of police.At the same hours, the invitation of Deputy Governors, 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, went to the command.Kocaeli: Turkcell\'s data center in Gebze was raided by soldiers who participated in the coup attempt.Soldiers who tried to interrupt the internet service were detained.Malatya: A rebellious soldier opened fire inside a base of the Turkish 2nd Army, damaging six vehicles.The base was besieged by police and loyal soldiers, and the shooter was captured.Marmaris: Three military helicopters carried out a bomb attack on the hotel where Erdoğan was staying.Forty rebellious soldiers of the Special Forces Command clashed with the police in the region.Mersin: Mersin Garrison and Mediterranean Region Commander Admiral Nejat Atilla Demirhan called Mersin Provincial Police Deputy Chief Yakup Usta and Gendarmerie Colonel Mustafa Bakçepınar and stated that the Turkish Armed Forces had taken over the administration.He introduced himself as the martial law garrison commander and ordered Mersin Governor Özdemir Çakacak and district governors to be taken into custody.Demirhan and Dağdelen, who made the same announcement with the police radio obtained from Mersin Police Department, were detained through the operation of the security forces.Sakarya: Sakarya Governorship was captured with armored personnel carriers, military trucks and many military jeeps from the military unit in the Kandıra district of Kocaeli.As a reinforcement, two military vehicles full of soldiers from the Sakarya central division command had to return to their barracks in the face of the resistance of the police and the harsh reaction of the people who took to the streets against the putschists.The vehicles occupying the Sakarya Governorate were seized by the citizens and the soldiers in them were neutralized and handed over to the security forces.Afterwards, citizens and security forces entered the governor\'s office and neutralized the soldiers there and suppressed the uprising in the province.Eight civilian citizens were injured as a result of the fire opened by the military during the incident.Şırnak: Çakırsöğüt Gendarmerie Commando Brigadier General Ali Osman Gürcan and 309 soldiers, that participated in the coup attempt, were detained by the security forces.\n\nTurkey\'s Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım responded to the events by stating that an ""illegal action is taking place outside of the chain of command"".He also said that ""the government elected by the people remains in charge and this government will only go when the people say so.""The Turkish Presidential office said President Erdoğan was on holiday inside Turkey and condemned the coup attempt as an attack on democracy.A presidential source also said Erdoğan and his government were still in power.The first messages from Erdoğan were transmitted at around 00:23At about 01:00, Erdoğan did a FaceTime interview with CNN Türk, in which he called upon his supporters to take to the streets in defiance of the military-imposed curfew, saying ""There is no power higher than the power of the people.Let them do what they will at the public squares and airports.""Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş appeared on live television, saying Turkey\'s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is still in charge of the government.The mayor of Ankara, Melih Gökçek of the AKP, encouraged people to go out to the city\'s streets in defiance, despite a curfew imposed by the military.Erdoğan\'s plane took off from Dalaman Airport near Marmaris at 23:47, but had to wait in the air south of Atatürk for the airport to be secured.His plane landed at 02:50\n\nThe First Army General Command in Istanbul stated in a news conference that the TSK did not support the coup and the perpetrators represented a tiny faction that were on the verge of being brought under control.Istanbul Atatürk Airport was closed; all flights from the airport were cancelled.There was an explosion in the TRT broadcasting headquarters and gunfire was reported in Ankara.Soon after, it was stormed by a crowd of civilians and police, with four soldiers inside reportedly being ""neutralized"".The channel went back on air and Karaş, who had previously announced the coup, said live that she had been held hostage and forced to read the declaration of the coup at gunpoint.\n\nBy 01:00, it was reported that the military had pulled its forces from the Atatürk airport and people were coming inside, but by 01:13, it was reported that tanks were inside the airport and gunfire was heard.\n\nTanks opened fire near the Turkish Parliament Building.The parliamentary building was also hit from the air.Injuries were reported among protesters following gunfire on Bosphorus Bridge.\n\nA helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was shot down by a Turkish military F-16 fighter jet.There were also reports of pro-state jets flying over Ankara to ""neutralize"" helicopters used by those behind the coup.\n\nAt 03:08, a military helicopter opened fire on the Turkish parliament.At 03:10, Turkish Armed Forces stated on their website that they had complete control over the country.At 03:12, Yıldırım made a statement saying that the situation was under control and that a no-fly zone was declared over Ankara and that military planes that still flew would be shot down.\n\nIt was reported that the Turkish parliament had been bombed again at 03:23 and 03:33.A helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was also seen flying by it.Half an hour following the report of 12 deaths and 2 injuries in the parliament, soldiers entered CNN Türk\'s headquarters and forced the studio to go off air.After an hour of interruption by the pro-coup soldiers, CNN Türk resumed its broadcast.Later, İsmail Kahraman said a bomb exploded at a corner of the public relations building inside the parliament, with no deaths but several injuries among police officers.\n\nAt around 04:00 two or three helicopters attacked Erdogan\'s hotel.According to eyewitness accounts, ten to fifteen heavily armed men landed and started firing.In the ensuing conflict, two policemen were killed and 8 were injured.\n\nThe Doğan News Agency reported that in Istanbul several individuals were injured after soldiers fired on a group of people attempting to cross the Bosphorus Bridge in protest of the attempted coup.\n\nOn Saturday 16 July 2016, at 00:42 EEST (UTC+3), a Turkish Black Hawk helicopter sent a distress signal and requested permission from Greek authorities for an emergency landing, and landed eight minutes later (00:50) at the Dimokritos airport in Alexandroupoli, in Greece, while two Greek F-16s observed the procedure and escorted it to the airport.The first reports said that the passengers were seven military personnel and a civilian.Later, it turned out that all were military personnel (two majors, four captains and two non-commissioned officers).They had removed the badges and insignia from their uniforms, making it impossible to know their rank.All were arrested after landing for illegal entry into the country.They were transferred to the local police station, while the Greek authorities at the airport guarded the helicopter.The eight passengers all requested political asylum in Greece as they believed they would not get a fair trial in Turkey.On 21 September 2016, Greece denied three out of the eight asylum.The men\'s lawyer Stavroula Tomara said they would be appealing the decision and said they had the ""impression that the decision has been predetermined, and that the interview was conducted just as a formality.""On 11 October 2016, four more of the eight were denied asylum.Two of the men who had previously been denied asylum applied for a re-evaluation but their applications were also rejected.\n\nAfter Erdoğan flew into Istanbul, he made a televised speech inside the airport at around 04:00, whilst thousands gathered outside.He addressed a crowd of supporters in the airport, at about 06:30 He said, ""In Turkey, armed forces are not governing the state or leading the state.They cannot.""He blamed ""those in Pennsylvania"" (a reference to Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, and his Hizmet Movement) for the coup attempt.Erdoğan also said he had plans to ""clean up"" the army, saying that ""This uprising is a gift from God to us.""State-run Anadolu Agency named former Colonel Muharrem Köse, who in March 2016 was dishonorably discharged for reported association with Gülen, as the suspected leader of the coup.However, the Alliance for Shared Values, a non-profit organization associated with Gülen, released a statement reiterating that it condemns any military intervention in domestic politics, and saying Erdoğan\'s allegations against the movement were ""highly irresponsible"".Gülen himself said in a brief statement just before midnight: ""As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nReuters reported that in early hours of 16 July, the coup appeared to have ""crumbled"" as crowds defied pro-coup military orders and gathered in major squares of Istanbul and Ankara to oppose it.Reuters also reported pro-coup soldiers surrendering to the police in Taksim Square, Istanbul.It was reported that by 05:18, Atatürk airport had completely been recaptured by the government whilst the police had surrounded the coupists inside the Turkish army headquarters, calling for them to surrender.Between 06:00–08:00 a skirmish took place there.In Akar\'s absence, Ümit Dündar, head of the First Army, was appointed Acting Chief of Staff.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning of 16 July, soldiers blocking the Bosphorus Bridge surrendered to the police.According to the government-run Anadolu Agency, this consisted of a group of 50 soldiers.Some of these soldiers were lynched by civilians despite the police\'s efforts, who fired into the air to protect the surrendering soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile, in the headquarters of the Turkish Army, 700 unarmed soldiers surrendered as the police conducted an operation into the building while 150 armed soldiers were kept inside by the police.The coupists in the TRT building in Istanbul surrendered in the early morning as well.Chief of Staff Akar, held hostage at the Akıncı Air Base in Ankara, was also rescued by pro-state forces.\n\nOne of the primary reasons that the coup failed was chaos among the plotters\' ranks.Turkey\'s National Intelligence Organization (MİT) head Hakan Fidan discovered the coup plot, and the plotters were forced to execute the coup five hours ahead of schedule.One of the main organizers, General Semih Terzi, was shot dead by loyalist Sgt.Maj.Ömer Halisdemir at the onset, demoralizing and disrupting command and control of the rebels.These two incidents resulted in the coup being carried out in an uncoordinated manner.The highest ranking staff officers opposed the coup, and publicly ordered all personnel to return to their barracks.Acting outside the military chain of command, the rebels lacked the coordination and resources to achieve their goals.The conscripted soldiers that the rebels mobilized were uninformed of their mission\'s true purpose and became demoralized.Many surrendered rather than shoot demonstrators.The commander of the First Army in Istanbul, General Ümit Dündar, personally called Erdoğan to warn him of the plot, persuading him to evacuate his hotel ahead of the plotters, and helped to secure Istanbul for Erdoğan to land.The MİT also mobilized its anti-aircraft guns, which the plotters were unaware existed, deterring rebel jets and commando teams.\n\nEqually important to the coup\'s failure, according to military strategist Edward N. Luttwak, was the inability of the rebels to neutralize Erdoğan and other high ranking government officials, either by killing or detaining them.A unit of special forces was sent via helicopter to kill or capture the president, but missed because he had been evacuated by his security detail just minutes before.Once Erdoğan landed at Atatürk International Airport (which had been recaptured from the rebels by his supporters), It became highly unlikely that the coup attempt would succeed.According to a military source, several rebel F-16s targeted Erdoğan\'s presidential jet en route to Istanbul, but they did not fire.A senior Turkish counter-terrorism official later stated that the jets did not fire because the fighter jet pilots were told by President Erdoğan\'s pilot over the radio that the (flight of the) Gulfstream IV was a Turkish Airlines flight.\n\nAccording to Naunihal Singh, author of Seizing Power, the coup attempt also failed because the plotters failed to secure control of the media and shape the narrative.Successful coups require that the rebels control the mass media.This allows even small rebel contingents to portray themselves as fully in control, and their victory as inevitable.Consequently, they convince the public, along with neutral and even loyalist soldiers, to defect to them or not resist.The rebels failed to properly broadcast their messages effectively across the media that they controlled.They failed to capture Türksat, Turkey\'s main cable and satellite communications company, and failed to gain control of the country\'s television and mobile phone networks.This allowed Erdoğan to make his Facetime call, and to speak on television.\n\nOther scholars of civil-military relations, like Drew H. Kinney, have said reports like Luttwak and Singh\'s miss the point of their own analysis: civil resistance thwarted the coup.Luttwak argues that wayward elements of the Turkish armed forces could not silence Erdoğan.Singh says that the rebels could not project success because they couldn\'t control the message.Kinney states that neither of these reasons on their own matter, but rather it\'s their effect—civil disobedience—that is important.We might find that ""[Gülen\'s movement] ...[might] have had nothing to do with the attempted takeover in July, but civilians [nevertheless] definitely played a role in thwarting the coup,"" writes Kinney.""...[A]n unhappy civilian populace mobilized to face down the military.""\n\nErdoğan wasn\'t censored (Luttwak\'s point) and was therefore able to use FaceTime to mobilize resistance, which in turn hindered the conspirators\' ability to project success (Singh\'s point).The result is civilian resistance to soldiers, i.e., people power.The reason Singh, Luttwak, and other scholars of civil-military relations miss this is, according to Kinney, because they ""usually do not study extra-military reasons for coup failures/successes,"" but rather put a premium on ""the inner-workings of the [military] operation.""In short, they blame the military for its failure rather than acknowledge the power of the masses and their successes.\n\nPro-state forces sent text messages to every Turkish citizen calling for them to protest against the coup attempt.Throughout the night sela prayers were repeatedly called from mosque minarets across the country to encourage people to resist the coup plotters.While the sela is usually called from minarets to inform the public of a funeral, they are also traditionally performed to notify of a significant event, in this case ""to rally people"".\n\nThe coup plotters initiated their operation hours ahead of the planned time when they understood that their plans had been compromised.Had the coup been launched at its original time, the middle of the night, much of the population would have been asleep.The streets would have been mostly empty.\n\nReports have emerged, neither confirmed nor denied by Russia or Turkey that the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate intercepted signals on an imminent coup passed on to loyal Turkish operatives.The intercepted plans revealed several helicopters with commandos were on the way to Marmaris\'s coastal resort, where Erdoğan stayed, capturing or killing him.Pre-warned, Erdoğan left quickly to avoid them.\n\nAn extensive purge of the Turkish civil service began in the wake of the coup attempt, with President Erdoğan warning his opponents that ""they will pay a heavy price for this.""The New York Times along with some other Western media such as The Economist, described the purges as a ""counter-coup"", with the Times expecting the president to ""become more vengeful and obsessed with control than ever, exploiting the crisis not just to punish mutinous soldiers but to further quash whatever dissent is left in Turkey,"".As of 20 July 2016, the purge already had seen over 45,000 military officials, police officers, judges, governors and civil servants arrested or suspended, including 2,700 judges, 15,000 teachers, and every university dean in the country.\n\n163 generals and admirals were detained, around 45% of the Turkish military\'s total.\n\nOn 18 July 2016, United States State Secretary John Kerry urged Turkish authorities to halt the increasing crackdown on its citizens, indicating that the crackdown was meant to ""suppress dissent.""French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault voiced concern, warning against a ""political system which turns away from democracy"" in response to the purges.\n\nOn 17 August 2016, Turkey started releasing what was expected to eventually amount to about 38,000 prison inmates, to make more space in the penal system for detainees, numbering about 35,000, who were arrested or detained after being involved in or suspected of association, with the 2016 failed coup.\n\nOn 28 September 2016, Turkish justice minister Bekir Bozdağ said 70,000 people had been processed and 32,000 were formally arrested.\n\nMajor General Cahit Bakir, who commanded Turkish forces under NATO in Afghanistan, and Brigadier General Sener Topuc, responsible for education and aid in Afghanistan, were detained by authorities in Dubai connected with the failed coup.\n\nGeneral Akın Öztürk, former Commander of the Turkish Air Force, was the Turkish military attaché to Israel.He was arrested on charges of having played a leading role in the failed coup.Öztürk has denied the charges.\n\nGeneral Adem Huduti, the commander of the Second Army, positioned along the southern borders with Syria and Iraq, and General Erdal Öztürk, the commander of the 3rd Corps, were also arrested.\n\nRear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been stationed at NATO\'s Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk, Virginia, sought asylum in the United States after being recalled by the Turkish government.\n\nIn July 2018, Istanbul\'s 25th Criminal Court sentenced 72 former soldiers involved in the coup attempt to life in prison.\n\nOn 20 June 2019, a terrorism court in Turkey sentenced 151 people to life in prison, including General Akın Öztürk, former commander of Turkish Air Force and the most senior officer involved in the coup.128 people received ""aggravated life"" sentences, which indicates harsh conditions without parole, for their role in the coup, with another 23 receiving standard life sentences.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom President Erdoğan said as one of the principal conspirators, condemned the coup attempt and denied any role in it.""I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey,"" he said in an emailed statement reported by The New York Times.""Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force.I pray to God for Turkey, Turkish citizens, and all those currently in Turkey that this situation is resolved peacefully and quickly.As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nPresident Erdoğan asked the United States to extradite Gülen: ""I call on you again, after there was a coup attempt.Extradite this man in Pennsylvania to Turkey!If we are strategic partners or model partners, do what is necessary.""Prime Minister Yildirim has threatened war against any country that would support Gülen.Turkish Labor Minister Süleyman Soylu said that ""America is behind the coup.""\n\nRegarding the AKP\'s statement against Gülen, Secretary of State Kerry invited the Turkish government ""to present us with any legitimate evidence that withstands scrutiny,"" before they would accept an extradition request.\n\nOn 15 August 2016, former United States diplomat James Jeffrey, who was the United States ambassador to Turkey from 2008 until 2010 made the following remarks: ""The Gülen movement has some infiltration at the least in the military that I am aware of.They of course had extreme infiltration into the police and judiciary earlier.I saw that when I was in Turkey previously, particularly in the Sledgehammer case, Hakan Fidan case, and the corruption cases in 2013.Obviously, significant segment of Turkey\'s bureaucracy was infiltrated and had their allegiance to a movement.That of course is absolutely unacceptable and extremely dangerous.It likely led to the coup attempt.""\n\nOutside Turkey, in Beringen, Belgium, anti-coup protesters attempted to attack a building owned by the pro-Gülen movement group \'Vuslat\'.The police brought in a water cannon to keep the attackers at bay.In news articles it was stated that the police also protected the houses of Gülen supporters.People advocated on social media to go to Beringen once more, and there was unrest in Heusden-Zolder, elsewhere in Belgium.Furthermore, in Somalia the government ordered ""the total closure of all activities"" of an organization linked to the Gülen movement, and gave its staff seven days to leave the country.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, President Erdoğan said Western countries were ""supporting terrorism"" and the military coup, saying ""I\'m calling on the United States: what kind of strategic partners are we, that you can still host someone whose extradition I have asked for?""\n\nOn 31 January 2017, British Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, Alan Duncan said he believed the Gülen movement was responsible for the coup attempt.Duncan went on saying ""the organization which incorporated itself into the state tried to topple the democratic structure in Turkey"".\n\nIn a speech on 29 July 2016, President Erdoğan said U.S. Central Command chief Joseph Votel was ""siding with coup plotters""; Erdoğan said the United States was protecting Fethullah Gülen, whom the Turkish government blames for the coup attempt.Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim made similar comments.In response, Votel said that the Turkish government\'s statements were ""unfortunate and completely inaccurate"" and expressed concern that the mass arrests and firings of military officers would damage military cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey.Similarly, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said that the Turkish military purges were impairing the fight against ISIS.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, in an escalation of tensions with the United States, Erdoğan questioned Turkey\'s relationship with the United States and criticized the West, saying that ""script"" for the abortive putsch last month was ""written abroad"".Erdoğan stated that he had personally asked Obama to extradite Gülen to Turkey.When the U.S. government replied it would need evidence of the cleric\'s guilt before extradition, to which Erdoğan said: ""When you asked for the return of a terrorist, we did not ask for documentation. ...Let us put him on trial.""\n\nYeni Şafak daily, a Turkish pro-state newspaper, stated that the former commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, now-retired United States Army General John F. Campbell, was the ""mastermind"" behind the coup attempt in Turkey.Campbell called the statement ""absolutely ridiculous"" and President Obama said ""Any reports that we had any previous knowledge of a coup attempt, that there was any U.S. involvement in it, that we were anything other than entirely supportive of Turkish democracy are completely false, unequivocally false.""\n\nOn 1 December 2017, Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for American political analyst, former CIA official and former vice chairman of US National Intelligence Council Graham Fuller, stating his involvement in the coup.A career US State Department official who was once CIA Station Chief in Kabul and later went on to be a political scientist in Rand Corporation specializing in the Middle East, Turkish authorities said Fuller attended a meeting in Istanbul on 15 July 2016 involving organization and coordination of the botched coup.Another American among the attendance, as stated by the Turkish prosecutors, was academic Henri Barkey who was named a suspect a week after the failed coup.\n\nThe U.S. consulate in Turkey issued an advisory to U.S. citizens to avoid the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey, which houses about 50 nuclear bombs, until ""normal operations have been restored"".They stated that local authorities were denying access to the air base and that power supplying the air base was shut off.\n\nThe Incirlik base is important to the U.S.-led effort in Syria to combat ISIL and other militants.Nearly 1,500 American personnel are housed in the base.\n\nTwenty-four hours after initial reports that the air base was shut down, United States defense department officials confirmed that the base and its airspace had re-opened to military aircraft and that operations by American aircraft will resume.The Turkish commander of the air base, brig.Gen. Bekir Ercan Van was arrested.After the failure of the coup Gen Bekir Ercan Van sought asylum from the U.S., but his request was denied by U.S.\n\nFollowing the failed coup attempt multiple media outlets have published editorials advocating the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Incirlik Air base as Turkey is unstable.\n\nOn 16 July, anti-coup protesters chanted against locals in areas of Istanbul with high concentration of Alevis, including Okmeydanı and Gazi.Such incidents also occurred in a quarter of Antakya with a high Alevi population, where a motorcyclist stating to be a sharia advocate was lynched.In a neighbourhood of Ankara, shops belonging to Syrians were attacked by a mob.In Malatya, Sunni Islamists harassed residents of an Alevi neighbourhood, particularly the women, and attempted to enter the neighbourhood en masse.Police intervened and blocked all roads leading there.In Kadıköy, people drinking alcohol in public were attacked by a group of religious fundamentalists.\n\nFollowing the arrests, thousands of anti-coup protesters demanded instituting the death penalty against detainees connected with the coup, chanting ""we want the death penalty"".President Erdoğan has been open to reinstituting the death penalty, noting that ""in a democracy, whatever the people want they will get.""Turkish authorities have not executed anyone since 1984, but legally abolished capital punishment only in 2004 as a pre-condition to join the European Union.\n\nEuropean Union officials have been vocal about their opposition to purges by Turkish authorities in connection to the coup.French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that Turkey must work within the framework of the law to uphold Europe\'s democratic principles.Furthermore, on 18 July 2016, Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of Foreign Affairs of the European Union, announced that no country will be admitted into the European Union ""if it introduces the death penalty"".Moreover, German press secretary, Steffen Seibert, stated that reinstituting the death penalty will end Turkey\'s accession talks with the European Union.\n\nTurkey is a member of the Council of Europe, and ratified the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) as part of its terms of membership.The ECHR is an international treaty that includes the abolition of the death penalty among its terms.As such, Turkey is legally bound not to reintroduce the death penalty.\n\nOn 20 July 2016, President Erdoğan announced a three-month state of emergency in response to the attempted coup, invoking Article 120 of the Constitution of Turkey (""Declaration of state of emergency because of widespread acts of violence and serious deterioration of public order"").Under the state of emergency, under Article 121, ""the Council of Ministers, meeting under the chairpersonship of the President of the Republic, may issue decrees having the force of law on matters necessitated by the state of emergency"", with decrees subject to subsequent parliamentary approval.The state of emergency was endorsed by the Parliament on 21 July by 346 votes to 115.The Justice and Development Party and the Nationalist Movement Party supported the state of emergency, whilst the Republican People\'s Party and the Peoples\' Democratic Party opposed it.Prime Minister Yıldırım said at the Parliament that the state of emergency was necessary to ""get rid of this scourge rapidly"".\n\nAs part of the state of emergency, deputy prime minister Kurtulmuş announced that Turkey was temporarily suspending part of the European Convention on Human Rights following the attempted coup, invoking Article 15 of the Convention (""war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation"").The suspensions must be notified to the Council of Europe and may not affect the right to a fair trial or the prohibition on torture.\n\nThis state of emergency in Turkey as well as the hindrance of the right to protest that occurred within such framework have been layered onto a longer history of emergency rules, oppressive legislation and daily government practice that have reinforced both.We can see from this the ""autocratisation"" process in Turkey has thrived of existing legal framework deeply associated in legacies of past ""emergencies"".\n\nOn 3 October 2016 Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş declared the governments intention to extend the state of emergency by a further three months raising objections from both the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) and Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) were critical of the governments use of their emergency powers and declared that they would vote against an extension.\n\nFollowing the National Security Council\'s recommendation for the extension President Erdoğan stated that it was possible that the state of emergency could last for longer than a year prompting outcry from the opposition, Leader of the Main Opposition Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu said that ""The president saying that the state of emergency can last longer than 12 months is strengthening the fear of a counter-coup"" and that it was ""raising the prospect of opportunist measures.""\n\nThe AKP\'s governmental majority allowed the three-month extension to take effect on 19 October 2016.The two-year-long state of emergency was ended on 19 July 2018.\n\nOn 16 July 2016, the media reported that eight Turkish military personnel of various ranks had landed in Greece\'s northeastern city of Alexandroupolis on board a Black Hawk helicopter and claimed political asylum in Greece.While the Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu demanded extradition of ""the eight traitors as soon as possible"", the Greek authorities stated: ""We will follow the procedures of international law.However, we give severe considerations to the fact that [the Turkish military men] are accused, in their own country, of violating the constitutional order and trying to overthrow democracy.""The helicopter was returned to Turkey shortly thereafter.The eight asylum seekers, their asylum case pending, were later transferred to Athens, mainly for safety reasons.On 26 January, the Supreme Court of Greece eventually ruled against their extradition, on the grounds that the eight were unlikely to face a fair trial if returned to their home country and due to concerns over their safety.\n\nOn 15 February 2017, five Turkish commandos illegally entered Greece through the Evros river.However, once they entered the country, the group split.The two of them surrendered to the police and on 20 February 2017, requested political asylum.They were being held in the city of Alexandroupolis.The two men belonged to the Turkish navy.The names given by the two reportedly match the names of two fugitives wanted in relation to the shadowy operation against Erdoğan himself.The Greek government mentioned that the Greek authorities will not allow the country to be dragged into the ongoing feud between the Turkish state and the followers of Gulen.But there were no sign of the other three.According to a lawyer there were indications that the other three have been arrested by Greek authorities who were about to expel them to Turkey.According to new evidence and new information these three ""arrested"" marines were delivered under fast and informal procedures from Greek to Turkish services.\n\nAfter the coup attempt, two Turkish military attachés in Athens, Staff Col. İlhan Yaşıtlı and naval attaché Col. Halis Tunç, had reportedly disappeared along with their families.The Greek foreign ministry canceled the two attachés\' accreditations on 7 August 2016, upon the request of the Turkish foreign ministry.Greek media reported that they might have fled to Italy.On 11 August 2016, the Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu confirmed the reports saying that they had left Greece for Italy on 6 August and adding that Turkey would officially ask the Italian authorities to extradite the two soldiers.\n\nOn 9 August 2016, the media reported that Turkey\'s Rear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been on a United States-based assignment for NATO and after the coup was subject to a detention order in Turkey, had sought asylum in the United States.\n\nIn mid-November 2016, it was officially confirmed that about 40 Turkish military servicemen of various ranks stationed at NATO command structures had applied for asylum in Germany and Belgium.\n\nIn January 2017, Der Spiegel magazine and ARD broadcaster reported that about 40 mostly high-ranking Turkish soldiers who worked at NATO facilities in Germany requested asylum in Germany.\n\nAt the end of February 2017, Germany said it had received 136 asylum requests from Turks holding diplomatic passports since the July coup attempt.The figure was a total for August 2016 to January 2017; some were presumed to be military officers posted to NATO bases in Germany.\n\nIn November 2016, NATO\'s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that Turkish NATO Officers had requested asylum in the countries where they had been posted.He did not name the nations involved or the number of officers, saying it was a matter for those countries to decide.He said: ""Some Turkish officers working in NATO command structure ... have requested asylum in the countries where they are working. ...As always, this is an issue that is going to be assessed and decided by the different NATO allies as a national issue.""\n\nAs of March 2017, Norway have granted asylum for four Turkish soldiers and a military attache.\n\nSeveral Turkish citizens with diplomatic passports have sought political asylum in Switzerland.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, detainees in Turkey have been denied access to legal counsel, have been beaten and tortured.They have not been provided with adequate food, water, or medical care.At least one has attempted suicide.Amnesty International wanted the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture to send people to check on detainees conditions.A person who had been on duty at the Ankara police headquarters said that police denied medical treatment to a detainee.""Let him die.We will say he came to us dead,"" the witness quoted a police doctor as saying.\n\nAlso, Erdoğan has extended the maximum period of detention for suspects from four days to 30, a move Amnesty said increased the risk of torture or other maltreatment of detainees.\n\nTurkish Justice Ministry denied the reports and the Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said on his Twitter account: ""There has not been any torture or assault of detainees in custody,"" in response to reports by Amnesty International.""The claims of torture and assault make up a pre-packaged misinformation campaign formed by members of FETÖ, one which is untrue and distorted,""\n\nOn 7 August, between three and five million people gathered for an anti-coup rally organized by the Turkish authorities in Istanbul.President Erdoğan and the two leaders of the major opposition parties (the Republican People\'s Party and the Nationalist Movement Party) were present.\n\nGreek authorities on several Aegean islands have called for emergency measures to curtail a growing flow of refugees from Turkey; the number of migrants and refugees willing to make the journey across the Aegean has increased noticeably after the failed coup.At Athens officials voiced worries because Turkish monitors overseeing the deal in Greece had been abruptly pulled out after the failed coup without being replaced.Also, the mayor of Kos expressed concern in a letter to the Greek Prime Minister citing the growing influx of refugees and migrants after the failed coup.The Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises (SETE) warned about the prospect of another flare-up in the refugee/migrant crisis due to the Turkish political instability.\n\nVincent Cochetel, the director of the Europe Bureau of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in August 2016 that parts of the EU-Turkey deal about immigration were already de facto suspended because no Turkish police were present at Greek detention centres to oversee deportations.\n\nOn 25 August 2016, seven Turkish citizens sought asylum in Greece.Two were university professors, and their two children applied for asylum in Alexandroupoli after they illegally entered the country from the northeastern border.Also, three businessmen illegally reached the Greek island of Rhodes, and they also applied for asylum.\n\nOn 30 August 2016, a Turkish judge arrived at the Greek island of Chios on a migrant boat, with six Syrian nationals, and sought asylum in the country.He told the Greek coastguard and police officers that he is being persecuted in Turkey for his political beliefs by President Tayyip Erdoğan.The Turkish judge had been arrested for illegally entering the country and was transferred to Athens for his asylum proceedings.The Syrian nationals claimed refugee status.\n\nOn 11 September 2016, four Turkish civilians were arrested by Turkish police.An academic and a teacher attempted to escape to Greece illegally by crossing the Evros river, and the other two because they organized the escape attempt.The academic and the teacher paid a total of 12,500 euros in Istanbul to arrange their escape to Greece.Before their attempt, both the academic and the teacher were suspended from their duties as part of the ongoing probe into the failed coup attempt.Police also seized an air raft, an oar and a pump while detaining the suspects.The court later ordered the two\'s release while the other two suspects, who organized the escape attempt, were arrested.\n\nOn 21 September 2016, ten Turkish civilians, two men, two women and six children landed by boat illegally on the Greek island of Rhodes and sought asylum.They told the Greek authorities they were working in the private sector in Turkey and the Turkish government was persecuting them due to their political beliefs.\n\nOn 29 September 2016, five Turkish nationals, a couple and their child and two other men, arrived in Greece, at Alexandroupolis by crossing the Evros River by boat illegally and requested political asylum.\n\nOn 12 December 2016, one female Turkish national, landed by boat, full of refugees and immigrants, illegally on the Greek island of Lesbos.She requested political asylum.\n\nOn 24 October 2017, Turkish authorities obtained information that 995 Turks have applied for asylum in Greece after the coup attempt.\n\nMore than 1,800 Turkish citizens requested asylum in Greece in 2017.\n\nOn 18 February 2018, seventeen Turkish nationals, including six children, requested asylum in Greece at Oinousses island.\n\nIn August 2018, the former lawmaker for the Peoples\' Democratic Party, Leyla Birlik, requested asylum in Greece after illegally crossing the border near Alexandroupolis.\n\nBerlin mayor, Michael Müller (SPD), said Turkey was waging war on supporters of the Gülen movement in Germany.He said that Turkish officials had approached him and asked him whether he would be prepared to confront the Gülen movement in Berlin critically and, if necessary, to support measures against it.The mayor rejected the idea and made it very clear that Turkish conflicts could not be waged in the city.\n\nDer Spiegel presented classified documents, which showed that Turkey\'s secret service (MIT) had asked Germany\'s foreign intelligence agency (BND) for help in rounding up Gülen supporters in Germany.The Turkish secret service wanted the BND to use its influence to spur German lawmakers into taking action against Gülen supporters and extraditing them to Turkey.Also, Turkey\'s government has sent German authorities requests for searches and extraditions linked to supporters of Fethullah Gülen in Germany.\n\nIn Germany businesses thought to be in support of the Gülen movement have been harassed by Erdoğan supporters.\n\nAfter the failed coup, there was a massive demonstration in Cologne at Germany, in late July, in support of Turkish President Erdoğan.Erdoğan wanted to address the participants via video but was rejected by the local authorities and the German Constitutional Court due to security concerns.Turkey said that the ban was unacceptable and a violation of freedom of expression.\n\nGerman authorities said Turkish mosques in Germany were playing Turkish politics and worried that Turkey\'s internal politics spilled over into German cities.For years, German authorities had encouraged Turkey\'s state-run religious institution Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs usually referred to as DİTİB to provide Islamic preachers and teachers and Gülen Movement Schools for the large Turkish diaspora in Germany.DİTİB manages some 900 mosques in Germany.Gülen movement runs 100 educational facilities in Germany.\n\nAfter the failed coup DİTİB published a sermon praising ""our noble nation"" for rising against ""a wretched network"" that had sown ""seeds of sedition, rebellion and hostility.""According to Volker Beck, a member of the center-left Greens in Germany\'s Bundestag, ""That was not a religious text.It was a declaration of obedience to Mr. Erdoğan and his measures since the coup attempt,"" Volker Kauder, parliamentary group leader of the Germany\'s ruling Christian Democrats, the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU)/Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) faction, said Turkish-Germans should be loyal to Germany first and foremost.\n\nGermans of Turkish origin are being pressured in Germany by informers and officers of Turkey\'s MIT spy agency.According to reports Turkey had 6,000 informants plus MIT officers in Germany who were putting pressure on ""German Turks"".Hans-Christian Ströbele said that there was an ""unbelievable"" level of ""secret activities"" in Germany by Turkey\'s MIT agency.According to Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, not even the former communist East German Stasi secret police had managed to run such a large ""army of agents"" in the former West Germany: ""Here, it\'s not just about intelligence gathering, but increasingly about intelligence service repression.""\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nGermany\'s Office for Migration and Refugees said on 18 November 2016, it had received 4,437 political asylum requests from Turkish citizens up to October, compared to 1,767 for the whole of last year.""We must expect that the number of Turks who are seeking political asylum in Germany will continue to rise,"" said Stephan Mayer, the domestic policy speaker of the union coalition in the Bundestag.\n\nOn 10 December 2016, eleven Turkish nationals, 10 adults and one child, in a martial arts group have applied for asylum in Germany.\n\nAs of January 2018, Germany was first place and Greece second as EU destinations of choice for Turkish nationals requesting asylum after the coup attempt.\n\nTurkish police have carried out simultaneous raids in 18 cities against companies associated with United States-based Fethullah Gülen.The state-run Anadolu Agency said police searched 204 premises and detained 187 businessmen for ""membership in a terror organization"" and ""providing financial support to a terror organization"".All suspects\' assets were seized.\n\nWikiLeaks released Turkish emails and documents to respond to the Turkish government\'s purges that followed the coup attempt.In turn, the Turkish Telecommunications Communications Board blocked access to the WikiLeaks website.On 17 July 2016 Wikileaks had announced on Twitter, the leak of approximately 300,000 emails and over 500,000 documents, including those to and from AKP.\n\nWikiLeaks stated that it was attacked shortly after 17 July announcement of the planned publication and hypothesized that Turkish authorities were responsible.WikiLeaks stated in a tweet, ""our infrastructure is under sustained attack.""Tweets from WikiLeaks include ""We are unsure of the true origin of the attack.The timing suggests a Turkish state power faction or its allies.We will prevail & publish.""and: ""Turks will likely be censored to prevent them reading our pending release of 100k+ docs on politics leading up to the coup."", ""We ask that Turks are ready with censorship bypassing systems such as TorBrowser and uTorrent""; ""And that everyone else is ready to help them bypass censorship and push our links through the censorship to come.""\n\nUpon the release of the email dump, it has been reported that the emails contain little to no damning information, and instead are just mails from a public mailing list, but also linked externally to ""voter information on all of the women registered to vote in 78 out of Turkey\'s 81 provinces"".\n\nSeveral places were renamed to commemorate the failed coup: Boğaziçi Köprüsü (Bosphorus Bridge) → 15 Temmuz Şehitler Köprüsü Kızılay Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Kızılay Demokrasi Meydanı Ahmet Taner Kışlalı Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Milli İrade Meydanı (Reverted to original name a few days later) Büyük İstanbul Otogarı → İstanbul 15 Temmuz Demokrasi Otogarı In TRT, Yeni Haber Stüdyosu → 15 Temmuz Millet Stüdyosu Kazan → Kahramankazan about the province\'s local people\'s resistance to the coup plotters.Kahraman means ""hero"" in Turkish Niğde University → Niğde Ömer Halisdemir University\n\nIn 2018, the Istanbul Municipal Council decided to change the names of a total of 90 streets that included words which could be associated with FETÖ.\n\nThe Presidency of Religious Affairs stated that it would not be providing religious funeral services to the dead coupists, except for ""privates and low-ranking officers compelled by force and threats who found themselves in the midst of the conflict without full knowledge of anything"".\n\nA document dated 26 September 2016 showed that Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) asked Turkish missions and religious representatives abroad to profile Gülen movement expatriates living in their respective foreign countries.Gülen-linked schools, businesses, foundations, associations, media outlets and others were also included in the reports.Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs has gathered intelligence via imams from 38 countries.\n\nBelgium officials said they would withdraw recognition of Diyanet mosques in the country if necessary.\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nOn 21 December 2016, the Turkish government has recalled Yusuf Acar, the religious affairs attaché of the Turkish Embassy in the Netherlands, after Dutch authorities said he was spying.Acar collected information of people who sympathize with Fethullah Gülen at Netherlands and passed it on to the Turkish authorities.The Dutch government called spying activities an ""unwanted and non-acceptable interference in the lives of Dutch citizens.""and the attaché was reportedly declared persona non grata and received a ""deportation warning"" by Dutch authorities.\n\nOn 26 January 2017, President Erdoğan, during his visit to Tanzania, asked his Tanzanian counterpart John Magufuli to take action against the network of Fethullah Gülen.\n\nIn April 2017 it was announced that President Erdoğan planned to establish a purpose-built museum dedicated to the coup events, called the ""Museum of the 15 July: Martyrs and Democracy"", to be located in Kahramankazan, a town near Ankara.Paid for by Turkish Ministry of Culture funds, it is planned to open at the end of 2018.The museum opened in December 2019\n\nAmong the Turkish opposition parties, the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) issued a statement expressing their public opposition to the coup, and the Hürriyet Daily News reported that Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bahçeli telephoned Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım to express his opposition to the coup.The co-chairs of the opposition Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) issued a statement saying that the party was ""under all circumstances and as a matter of principle against all kinds of coup.""Amongst the minor parties, left-wing nationalist Patriotic Party\'s Doğu Perinçek backed democracy, when he held Gülen and the Americans responsible.Kurdish militant separatist organization Kurdistan Workers\' Party, which Turkey and its allies label as a terrorist organization, urged their supporters to stay away from the coup and rather defend their people, while the Communist Party called upon the people to overthrow the AKP government which they called an ""enemy of humanity"".\n\nDuring the first hours of the coup plotters\' moves of blocking Istanbul\'s bridges and flying fighter jets low over Istanbul and Ankara, Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjørn Jagland tweeted against the coup attempt and underlined that ""any attempt to overthrow the democratically elected leaders is unacceptable"".\n\nRussia\'s President Vladimir Putin called Erdoğan out of solidarity before all NATO member countries\' heads following the coup attempt.Erdoğan thanked the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev – who was the first president to show solidarity after the coup attempt – for his support in solving the 7-month crisis over downed Russian Sukhoi Su-24 and the Prime Minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, who was among the first NATO country leaders to condemn the coup attempt, already from the early hours of Saturday.\n\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the then prime minister of Pakistan, was all praise for the people of Turkey and the AKP government and strongly condemned what he termed as an attempt to undermine democracy in Turkey.""We deeply admire the resolve of the brave and resilient Turkish people, who stood up against the forces of darkness and anarchy to express their support and commitment to democracy,"" the PM said in a statement issued from his office.\n\nThe majority of countries either expressed their support for the government or called for restraint.On 16 July 2016, however, a proposed United Nations Security Council statement denouncing the coup was not accepted by Egypt, a non-permanent member of the Council at the time, due to textual disagreements.Egyptian diplomats said that the council is ""in no position to qualify, or label [the Turkish] government – or any other government for that matter – as democratically elected or not"".Objection by the United States and the UK – permanent members of the Security Council – led to Egypt proposing a new statement calling for all sides to ""respect the democratic and constitutional principles and the rule of law"", which was rejected, preventing the condemnation of the coup attempt by the Security Council.The leader of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky supported the coup attempt.\n\nAl-Monitor reported that ""Unlike Ankara\'s Western allies, Iran did not wait for the coup\'s failure to speak up.Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif voiced support for democracy in a Twitter message in the early hours of the unrest, writing ""Stability, and democracy in Turkey are paramount"".In a subsequent phone call after the failure of the coup attempt, President Hassan Rouhani told Erdoğan the coup attempt was ""a test to identify your domestic and foreign friends and enemies.""An Iranian official pointed out parallels between the coup attempt in Turkey and the coup against Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mussadiq in 1953: ""What we know is that this attempt was triggered by foreign hands.We have experienced the same thing in the past.Since Mr. Erdogan wants to play a more positive path in the region today, they want to overthrow him.""\n\nMustafa Akıncı, President of Northern Cyprus, welcomed the fact that ""no community in Turkey ... applauded the coup as they have done in the past.""Azerbaijan strongly condemned the attempted military coup in Turkey and considered such actions unacceptable according to a statement from Novruz Mammadov, deputy head of the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration and chief of the foreign relations department.\n\nEuropean Commissioner dealing with Turkey\'s EU membership bid, Johannes Hahn, said it appears Turkey\'s government prepared arrest lists of political opponents before the coup attempt and had been waiting for the right time to act.In this sense, EU reported that as a main criticism to put this issue in the category of terrorism become the violation of the fundamental rights and fundamental values of the citizens.Hence, it underlines a total divergence of opinions and mentality between EU and Turkey which reached a deadlock here especially after the 15th of July in 2016.\n\nOn 19 July 2016, White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said during a press briefing that President Barack Obama has held a phone conversation with President Erdoğan: ""The President used the phone call to reiterate once again the strong commitment of the United States to the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey.The President pledged any needed assistance to the Turkish government as they conduct an investigation to determine exactly what happened.""\n\nOn 20 July 2016, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""Turkey has a large armed force, professional armed forces and ...I am certain they will continue as a committed and strong NATO ally.""On a statement released on 10 August 2016, the Secretary General once more strongly condemned the attempted coup and reiterated full support for Turkey\'s democratic institutions.He also expressed support for the elected Turkish government and respect for the courage of the Turkish people for resisting the coup plotters.\n\nOn 29 July 2016, the commander of U.S. Central Command, General Joseph Votel, denied statements by Turkey\'s president Erdoğan that he has supported the coup attempt in Turkey.\n\nOn 1 August 2016, United States Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, General Joseph Dunford, visited Turkey and condemned the coup attempt.Dunford said: ""The consistent theme throughout the day was a reaffirmation of the importance of the U.S.-Turkey relationship – the need for us to cooperate.""\n\nOn July, 20, there were reports that a group of Turkish military commandos coup fugitives would try to cross from Turkey to the island of Symi, in the southeastern Aegean, at Greece.The Hellenic Coast Guard was on alert and increased the patrols in the area, especially after a group of inflatable dinghies and other vessels were seen departing from Datça, on the Turkish coast, in the direction of Symi, they monitored the movements of the Turkish vessels, which remained in Turkish waters.Furthermore, a contingent of the Hellenic Police was dispatched to Symi to conduct checks there.The Greek government had been anticipating a possible attempt by participants in the failed coup to come to Greece and took the reports seriously.Turkish F-16 fighter jets were also scrambled to check reports that missing Turkish coast guard vessels had appeared in Greek waters in the Aegean.Later on the day, the Turkish interior ministry denied reports that rebel soldiers might have ""hijacked"" a vessel to flee to Greece.The Greek armed forces remained on alert the throughout the day for potential coup fugitives.\n\nAccording to Michael Rubin, from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Erdoğan had himself to blame for the coup.Following an increasingly Islamist agenda, Erdoğan had reportedly ""dropped any pretense of governing for all Turks.""After ""fanning the flames"" at the 2013 Gezi Park protests, he transformed the predominantly Kurdish-inhabited areas of southeastern Turkey ""into a war zone reminiscent of the worst days of the 1980s.""The biggest problem, according to Rubin, might have been Erdoğan\'s foreign policy, which managed to turn the initial ""no problems with neighbors"" doctrine into a situation where the country has problems with almost every neighbor and has even alienated some of its allies and friends.Rubin previously worked as an official at the Pentagon and less than 4 months before the coup, he wrote an article in Newsweek magazine titled, ""Will There Be a Coup Against Erdogan in Turkey?""\n\nBritish Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk warned that ""too late did Erdoğan realize the cost of the role he had chosen for his country.It\'s one thing to say sorry to Putin and patch up relations with Netanyahu; but when you can no longer trust your army, there are more serious matters to concentrate upon.""Even if this coup may have failed, Fisk expected another to follow in the months or years to come.\n\nTurkish professor Akın Ünver described the coup d\'état attempt as ""more of a mutiny"".\n\nThe name of the ""Peace at Home Council"" – Yurtta Sulh Konseyi – is derived from Atatürk\'s famous saying \'Peace at Home, Peace in the World\'.Journalist Ezgi Başaran said that ""the statement of the junta, that was [...] read on the [...] government TV [channel] as the coup got under way, bore a strong resemblance to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk\'s famous address to the Turkish Youth.[...] On the other hand, given that these references are too obvious, they may have been intentionally included to insinuate a Kemalist junta rather than a Gülenist one.""\n\nThe citizen journalism site Bellingcat published an analysis of the messages of a WhatsApp group consisting of high-ranking military officials who had taken part in the coup covering their activities including them killing several people.The messages were cross referenced with video footage.The group was named ""Yurtta sulh"" which refers to a peace at home speech and they seem secular and military with no references to Gülen or anything related during the several hours of messaging.\n\nNews reports have suggested that the coup ringleader was Adil Öksüz.Some believe Öksüz to have been an operative with Turkish intelligence.\n\nGerman Islamic studies scholar said the putschists tried to forestall a large-scale purge of judiciary and military, the implementation of which had already started on Saturday, the day after the coup attempt.According to Turkish investigative journalist Ahmet Şık, a list of officials to be purged had been ready compiled by the attorney-general of Izmir, Okan Bato, and was approved by President Erdoğan.According to this version, the putschists had to quickly bring forward their coup attempt before being disposed and arrested.\n\nDuring and after the events, several politicians and commentators suggested that the government knew about the coup in advance and possibly directed it.The facts that the coup attempt began in the evening rather than at a more inconspicuous time and that the events were largely confined to Ankara and Istanbul contributed to doubts about the authenticity of the coup attempt.Journalists and opposition politicians branded it a \'tragic comedy\' and \'theatre play\'.Advocates of such theories pointed to how Erdoğan stood to gain from the coup attempt in terms of increasing his popularity and support for his calls for an executive presidency, while being able to legitimize further crackdowns on judicial independence and the opposition in general.\n\nOther elements that were reported to support the theory included: no list of demands by the coup plotters, the organization and response of the police, the long lists of arrests that seemed to be ready surprisingly quickly (including arrests of 2,745 judges and 2,839 soldiers), and the obvious nature of the coup actions.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom Erdoğan had said as being one of the principal conspirators, commented, ""I don\'t believe that the world believes the accusations made by President Erdoğan.There is a possibility that it could be a staged coup and it could be meant for further accusations [against the Gülenists].""Journalist Cengiz Çandar, a veteran observer of Turkey\'s coups, said ""I have never seen any with this magnitude of such inexplicable sloppiness.""Prominent Hizmet (Gülen movement) spokesman Alp Aslandogan said, referencing that the Turkish Air Force commander met with Erdoğan before 15 July, that certain legal documentation related to the coup seemed written beforehand, arguing that within ""the indictment written by a prosecutor on the night of 15 July to 16 July, there were events there that didn\'t actually happen.Some events did happen, but those events didn\'t happen by the time the document started.It looks like a bigger plan was there, and part of the plan did not come to pass.""\n\nThe organization and spontaneous synchronization by large numbers of mosques was perceived to be unachievable unless there had been prior preparation, with journalists also pointing to how Erdoğan could have strategically used the call to prayer to invoke religious sentiment in a political situation as a veiled attack on state secularism.\n\nThousands of arrests and purges were conducted by Turkish authorities between 16 and 18 July 2016.The sheer number of these arrests made at such a speed could only be done so if the ""Turkish government had all those lists ready"", as suggested by Johannes Hahn, European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, on 18 July 2016.Hahn also said that because these lists were already available immediately after the coup, the ""event was prepared"" and the lists were to be used ""at a certain stage"".\n\nMehmet Dişli, who was seen giving orders to the coup plotters and who was the one who put a belt around Hulusi Akar\'s neck to make him sign, is the brother of Şaban Dişli, a former vice president of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and confidant of Erdoğan.\n\nSeveral social media users have compared the coup attempt to the Reichstag fire in 1933, which Adolf Hitler used as an excuse to suspend civil liberties and order mass arrests of his opponents.Politico correspondent Ryan Heath said that ""the coup was staged to allow Erdoğan to purge the military of opponents and increase his grip on the country"".Heath used Twitter to share comments from his Turkish source, who called the events of Friday night a ""fake coup"" which would help a ""fake democracy warrior"" (referring to Erdoğan).The source said: ""Probably we\'ll see an early election [in] which he\'ll try to guarantee an unbelievable majority of the votes.And this will probably guarantee another 10–15 years of authoritarian, elected dictatorship.""\n\nThe New York Times reported that some Turkish citizens believed the coup attempt was staged by Erdoğan to improve his public image and popularity, while cracking down on political opponents and expanding his power.Critics found it suspect that reportedly no government officials were arrested or harmed during the attempted coup, which—among other factors—raised the suspicion of a false flag event staged by the Turkish government to crack down on opposition parties.Those in Turkey suggesting that the coup was staged are also being questioned by the government.\n\nPoliticians and journalists who were skeptical of the authenticity of the coup plot said that in reality, a \'civil coup\' had effectively been staged against the Armed Forces and Judiciary, both of which were extensively purged of stated Gülen supporters by the government shortly after the events.Skeptics said that the coup would be used as an excuse for further erosion of judicial independence and a crackdown on the opposition, giving the AKP greater and unstoppable power over all state institutions and paving the way for a more radical Islamist agenda at odds with the founding principles of the Turkish Republic.\n\nJustice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said in late July 2016 that Turkish social media users who said the government was staging the coup faced investigation: ""Just look at the people who are saying on social media that this was theatre.Public prosecutors are already investigating them.Most of them are losers who think it is an honor to die for Fethullah Gülen\'s command.""\n\nOn 12 July 2017, Stockholm Center for Freedom, a monitoring group with reported links to the Gülen movement, published a controversial report stating that President Erdogan orchestrated the coup bid as a false flag to consolidate his powers, set up his opposition for a mass persecution, and push Turkish Armed Forces into a military incursion into Syria.According to the report, it uncovered new evidence from 11 July 2016, four days before the planned coup bid, that a secret plan was circulated among select group of Armed Forces to give an appearance of a coup attempt.The plan was sanctioned by intelligence and military chiefs with the approval of Erdogan.\n\nIn early November 2017, Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for , former Director of the Middle East Program of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, stating that he is an agent of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), that he was present in Istanbul during the 2016 Turkish coup attempt, and that he was one of the key organizers behind the coup attempt.Around 1 December, the Istanbul prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for Graham E. Fuller, an American author and political analyst specializing in Islamic extremism after a long CIA career and holding the role of vice-chair of the United States National Intelligence Council.The prosecutor\'s office based the warrant on suspicion of Fuller helping to plan the coup attempt.Hürriyet stated that Turkish authorities believed that they had traced Fuller\'s location before the attempted coup and afterward when he left Turkey.\n\nBarkey denied his reported role in the coup, describing the claims as ""so ludicrous that they do not even deserve the term \'science fiction\'.""\n\nDeep state in Turkey The Imam\'s Army List of coups and coup attempts since 2010 List of modern conflicts in the Middle East List of attacks on legislatures\n', 'Claim_Context': 'In March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.

112,"{'Wiki_Title': '2016 Turkish coup attempt', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'On 15 July 2016, a faction within the Turkish Armed Forces, organized as the Peace at Home Council, attempted a coup d\'état against state institutions, including the government and president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.They attempted to seize control of several places in Ankara, Istanbul, Marmaris and elsewhere, such as the Asian side entrance of the Bosphorus Bridge, but failed to do so after forces and civilians loyal to the state defeated them.The Council cited an erosion of secularism, elimination of democratic rule, disregard for human rights, and Turkey\'s loss of credibility in the international arena as reasons for the coup.The government said it had evidence the coup leaders were linked to the Gülen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the Republic of Turkey and led by Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish businessman and a well-known Islamic scholar who lives in exile in Pennsylvania.The Turkish government alleged that Gülen was behind the coup (which Gülen denied) and that the United States was harboring him.Events surrounding the coup attempt and the purges in its aftermath reflect a complex power struggle between Islamist elites in Turkey.\n\nDuring the coup attempt, over 300 people were killed and more than 2,100 were injured.Many government buildings, including the Turkish Parliament and the Presidential Palace, were bombed from the air.Mass arrests followed, with at least 40,000 detained, including at least 10,000 soldiers and 2,745 judges, for being affiliated with the coup attempt.15,000 education staff were also suspended and the licenses of 21,000 teachers working at private institutions were revoked after the government stated they were loyal to Gülen.More than 77,000 people have been arrested and over 160,000 fired from their jobs, on reports of connections to Gülen.\n\nThere were many reactions against the coup attempt, both domestically and internationally.The main opposition parties in Turkey condemned the attempt, while several international leaders—such as those of the United States, NATO, the European Union, and neighboring countries—called for ""respect of the democratic institutions in Turkey and its elected officials.""Many international organizations also opposed the coup.The United Nations Security Council, however, did not denounce the coup after disagreements over the phrasing of a statement.Iran opposed the coup and advised Erdogan to defeat the coup plotters.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the head of United States Central Command, General Joseph Votel, was ""siding with coup plotters"", after Votel criticized the Turkish government for arresting the Pentagon\'s contacts in Turkey.\n\nIn March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.The same month, the British Parliament\'s Foreign Affairs Select Committee said some Gulenists were involved in the coup d\'état attempt but found no hard evidence that Fethullah Gülen masterminded the failed coup and found no evidence to justify the United Kingdom designating the Gülen movement as a ""terrorist organization"".\n\nSince the 1970s, followers of the influential cleric Fethullah Gülen had assumed increasingly important positions within the Turkish state apparatus.Gülen several times advised his followers to take key positions in society and government, if necessary with a secret identity to avoid opposition from the laicistic Turkish army and government.Nevertheless, at the start of the 21st century, Gülen\'s followers achieved crucial positions of power in Turkey (and beyond) with a vast network of newspapers, TV channels, schools, associations, lobby organizations, financial institutions and positions within the state such as the army and the judiciary.Initially, the then Prime Minister Erdogan seemingly tolerated the power of the Gülen movement because of common interests such as limiting the undemocratic political power of the military, but also because of impotence and fear of Gülen\'s power within Turkey.\n\nA series of events eventually led to a rift between Erdogan and Gülen.For example, prosecutors that allegedly were aligned with the Gülen movement tried to arrest the intelligence chief Hakan Fidan for the peace negotiations with the PKK, and by extension PM Erdogan subsequently, as the Turkish secret service is directly subordinate to the prime minister of Turkey.During this period (2010-2013), state secrets were leaked, fraud was committed with the entrance exams for government employees (KPSS), a change of power occurred at the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) and (sex)tapes of both government members and opposition members were leaked.Following these events and other incidents, the Turkish government decided to designate the Gülen movement as parallel state and FETÖ (Fethullahist Terror Organization).Alleged Gülen supporters were fired or arrested.The coup attempt that followed is therefore also described by some analysts as a last desperate attempt by Gülenists to retain power.\n\nIt is widely reported that Kemalist ideology played a huge role in motivating the 15 July 2016 coup attempt, like all previous political interventions in the history of Turkey\'s military coups.Since the establishment of multiparty democracy in Turkey in 1946, the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), together with the judiciary, have viewed themselves as guardians of Kemalist ideals and the secular Turkish nationalist state established under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk against political parties that have promoted a larger role for Islam and minorities in public life.The military and judiciary have regularly intervened in politics to block or ban popular parties representing conservative Muslim Turks, attempting to relax the restrictions on traditional religious practices, such as women\'s wearing of headscarves.The military has toppled four elected governments: by coups in 1960 and 1980, and by military decisions in 1971 and 1997.The military has also banned several major political parties.In 1998, Erdoğan, then-mayor of Istanbul, was banned for life from politics and jailed because he had read a religious poem by Ziya Gökalp several years before, at a public meeting.In 2007, the military expressed its opposition to the election of Abdullah Gül, of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), as president, by issuing an e-memorandum.Still, Gül was eventually elected when the AKP won both a referendum on the matter.Also, a snap election, and the party returned with a larger majority in the parliament.The military cited erosion of secularism as one of the reasons for the coup in the statement published on the day of the coup.\n\nAs opposed to previous political interventions by the Turkish military, Turkey\'s AKP government and pro-state media maintain that the 15 July 2016 coup attempt was not motivated by allegiance to Kemalist ideology, but rather to the vast political, economic, and religious network led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen.Between 2007 and 2012, high-profile Kemalists, including high-ranking officers of the Turkish Armed Forces, faced a series of trials and purges, under reports of involvement in a secret society codenamed ""Ergenekon.""Supported by Islamist (both pro-Gülen and pro-Erdoğan) prosecutors, security officials, and media, the purges allowed lower-rank Islamist officers to assume high-ranking military positions.They were seen as a bid by Turkey\'s civilian leaders under President Erdoğan to establish dominance over the military.In these trials in 2013 – viewed as ""sensational"" and ""one of the biggest in recent Turkish history"" – 275 people, including senior military officers, journalists, lawyers, and academics, were said to be involved in the so-called ""Ergenekon"" conspiracy, reportedly plotting a coup in 2003/04 against then–Prime Minister Erdoğan.Additionally, some military officers were said to be involved in a separate reported plot, Sledgehammer.Simultaneously, Erdoğan promoted lower-ranking officers up the chain of command, ensuring that the military chief of staff was loyal to him and thereby demoralizing the army.\n\nThe AKP\'s alliance with Gülen started to collapse during 2013 as Gülenists targeted the AKP using corruption charges.After the split, Erdoğan decided it would be advantageous to rehabilitate the army.The ""Ergenekon"" convictions were overturned in April 2016 by the Court of Cassation, which ruled that the existence of the network was unproven.\n\nIn 2013, law enforcement efforts to fight corruption, which had led to the 2013 corruption scandal in Turkey, were faulted by Erdoğan.The anti-corruption efforts were a source of tension between the Gülenists and the AKP.In political analysis in the months prior to the coup attempt, the incidence of corruption was reported to be ""rife"" in Turkey.Following the coup attempt, some coup leaders cited corruption as a reason for their actions.\n\nOn 13 July, less than two days before the coup was launched, Erdoğan signed a bill giving Turkish soldiers immunity from prosecution while taking part in domestic operations.The bill requires cases against commanders to be approved by the prime minister, while district governors may sign cases against lower-ranking soldiers.The immunity bill was seen as part of the détente between the government and the armed forces.The latter has increasingly been taking over military operations in Kurdish-inhabited areas from police and paramilitary units.\n\nOn 15 July 2016, as reported just before 23:00 EEST (UTC+3), military jets were spotted flying over Ankara, and both the Fatih Sultan Mehmet and Bosphorus bridges in Istanbul were closed.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said military action was being ""taken outside the chain of command"" and it was an ""illegal attempt"" to seize power by ""part of the military"".He further said that those involved ""will pay the highest price.""Local media also reported tanks in Istanbul\'s Atatürk Airport.It was reported that Internet users within Turkey were blocked from accessing Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.Twitter later stated that it had ""no reason to think we\'ve been fully blocked"".Some hostages were taken at military headquarters, including the Turkish Chief of the General Staff Hulusi Akar.At around 21:00, the coupists had invited Salih Zeki Çolak, the commander of the Turkish Land Forces to the military headquarters.When he arrived, he was immediately apprehended.Abidin Ünal, head of the Turkish Air Force, who had been attending a wedding in Istanbul, was abducted from there by soldiers who descended from a helicopter.The coupists then tried to force Akar to sign the coup declaration, almost strangling him using a belt in the process.He refused and was then taken to the Akıncı Air Base and other commanders at the headquarters.The military also entered the Justice and Development Party\'s offices in Istanbul and asked people to leave.\n\nEarly reports said President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was safe in Marmaris, south-west Turkey, where he had been on holiday.\n\nFrom around 23:00 to midnight, helicopters bombed the police special forces headquarters and police air force headquarters in Gölbaşı, just outside of Ankara.The attacks left 42 dead and 43 injured.Türksat headquarters in Gölbaşı was also attacked, killing two security personnel.\n\nAt around 23:50, soldiers occupied Taksim Square in central Istanbul.\n\nAt 00:02, it was reported by Reuters that soldiers were inside the buildings of the state broadcaster, the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), in Ankara.During the coup attempt, soldiers forced anchor Tijen Karaş to read out a statement saying that ""the democratic and secular rule of law has been eroded by the current government"" and that Turkey was now led by the Peace at Home Council who would ""ensure the safety of the population.""The statement read in part: ""Turkish Armed Forces have completely taken over the administration of the country to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedoms, the rule of law and general security that was damaged.[...] All international agreements are still valid.We hope that all of our good relationships with all countries will continue.""The plotters said they had ""done so to preserve democratic order, and that the rule of law must remain a priority"".The statement also ordered temporary martial law (sıkıyönetim), and said a new constitution would be prepared ""as soon as possible"".TRT was then taken off air.\n\nOther media outlets were also raided by the putschists, such as Turkish newspaper Hürriyet and private broadcaster CNN Türk.\n\nReuters reported on 15 July that an EU source described the coup as ""well orchestrated,"" and predicted that ""given the scale of the operation, it is difficult to imagine they will stop short of prevailing.""Another EU diplomat said that the Turkish ambassador in his capital was shocked and ""taking it very seriously"".\n\nThe Peace at Home Council was reportedly chaired by Muharrem Köse.\n\nAdana: Upon receiving the intelligence that thirty soldiers from the 10th Air Base Command would move to the base where the regional and provincial gendarmerie commands were located, the police prevented the soldiers from leaving the guardhouse with TOMA and armored vehicles and blocked them.Bitlis: In the Tatvan district of Bitlis, on the orders of Brigade Commander Arif Seddar Afşar, helicopters were circulated in the skies of Tatvan and fired at the city.The brigade command left the municipality\'s construction equipment in front of the barracks in case there was a tank operation in the district.Denizli: Approximately five hundred officers and non-commissioned officers who participated in the coup attempt surrendered to the gendarmerie and police forces.They were interrogated at Çardak District Gendarme Command.Kars: With the order of Kars 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, the soldiers who came with tanks and armored personnel carriers surrounded the Police Headquarters building and wanted to detain Faruk Karaduman, the chief of police.At the same hours, the invitation of Deputy Governors, 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, went to the command.Kocaeli: Turkcell\'s data center in Gebze was raided by soldiers who participated in the coup attempt.Soldiers who tried to interrupt the internet service were detained.Malatya: A rebellious soldier opened fire inside a base of the Turkish 2nd Army, damaging six vehicles.The base was besieged by police and loyal soldiers, and the shooter was captured.Marmaris: Three military helicopters carried out a bomb attack on the hotel where Erdoğan was staying.Forty rebellious soldiers of the Special Forces Command clashed with the police in the region.Mersin: Mersin Garrison and Mediterranean Region Commander Admiral Nejat Atilla Demirhan called Mersin Provincial Police Deputy Chief Yakup Usta and Gendarmerie Colonel Mustafa Bakçepınar and stated that the Turkish Armed Forces had taken over the administration.He introduced himself as the martial law garrison commander and ordered Mersin Governor Özdemir Çakacak and district governors to be taken into custody.Demirhan and Dağdelen, who made the same announcement with the police radio obtained from Mersin Police Department, were detained through the operation of the security forces.Sakarya: Sakarya Governorship was captured with armored personnel carriers, military trucks and many military jeeps from the military unit in the Kandıra district of Kocaeli.As a reinforcement, two military vehicles full of soldiers from the Sakarya central division command had to return to their barracks in the face of the resistance of the police and the harsh reaction of the people who took to the streets against the putschists.The vehicles occupying the Sakarya Governorate were seized by the citizens and the soldiers in them were neutralized and handed over to the security forces.Afterwards, citizens and security forces entered the governor\'s office and neutralized the soldiers there and suppressed the uprising in the province.Eight civilian citizens were injured as a result of the fire opened by the military during the incident.Şırnak: Çakırsöğüt Gendarmerie Commando Brigadier General Ali Osman Gürcan and 309 soldiers, that participated in the coup attempt, were detained by the security forces.\n\nTurkey\'s Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım responded to the events by stating that an ""illegal action is taking place outside of the chain of command"".He also said that ""the government elected by the people remains in charge and this government will only go when the people say so.""The Turkish Presidential office said President Erdoğan was on holiday inside Turkey and condemned the coup attempt as an attack on democracy.A presidential source also said Erdoğan and his government were still in power.The first messages from Erdoğan were transmitted at around 00:23At about 01:00, Erdoğan did a FaceTime interview with CNN Türk, in which he called upon his supporters to take to the streets in defiance of the military-imposed curfew, saying ""There is no power higher than the power of the people.Let them do what they will at the public squares and airports.""Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş appeared on live television, saying Turkey\'s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is still in charge of the government.The mayor of Ankara, Melih Gökçek of the AKP, encouraged people to go out to the city\'s streets in defiance, despite a curfew imposed by the military.Erdoğan\'s plane took off from Dalaman Airport near Marmaris at 23:47, but had to wait in the air south of Atatürk for the airport to be secured.His plane landed at 02:50\n\nThe First Army General Command in Istanbul stated in a news conference that the TSK did not support the coup and the perpetrators represented a tiny faction that were on the verge of being brought under control.Istanbul Atatürk Airport was closed; all flights from the airport were cancelled.There was an explosion in the TRT broadcasting headquarters and gunfire was reported in Ankara.Soon after, it was stormed by a crowd of civilians and police, with four soldiers inside reportedly being ""neutralized"".The channel went back on air and Karaş, who had previously announced the coup, said live that she had been held hostage and forced to read the declaration of the coup at gunpoint.\n\nBy 01:00, it was reported that the military had pulled its forces from the Atatürk airport and people were coming inside, but by 01:13, it was reported that tanks were inside the airport and gunfire was heard.\n\nTanks opened fire near the Turkish Parliament Building.The parliamentary building was also hit from the air.Injuries were reported among protesters following gunfire on Bosphorus Bridge.\n\nA helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was shot down by a Turkish military F-16 fighter jet.There were also reports of pro-state jets flying over Ankara to ""neutralize"" helicopters used by those behind the coup.\n\nAt 03:08, a military helicopter opened fire on the Turkish parliament.At 03:10, Turkish Armed Forces stated on their website that they had complete control over the country.At 03:12, Yıldırım made a statement saying that the situation was under control and that a no-fly zone was declared over Ankara and that military planes that still flew would be shot down.\n\nIt was reported that the Turkish parliament had been bombed again at 03:23 and 03:33.A helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was also seen flying by it.Half an hour following the report of 12 deaths and 2 injuries in the parliament, soldiers entered CNN Türk\'s headquarters and forced the studio to go off air.After an hour of interruption by the pro-coup soldiers, CNN Türk resumed its broadcast.Later, İsmail Kahraman said a bomb exploded at a corner of the public relations building inside the parliament, with no deaths but several injuries among police officers.\n\nAt around 04:00 two or three helicopters attacked Erdogan\'s hotel.According to eyewitness accounts, ten to fifteen heavily armed men landed and started firing.In the ensuing conflict, two policemen were killed and 8 were injured.\n\nThe Doğan News Agency reported that in Istanbul several individuals were injured after soldiers fired on a group of people attempting to cross the Bosphorus Bridge in protest of the attempted coup.\n\nOn Saturday 16 July 2016, at 00:42 EEST (UTC+3), a Turkish Black Hawk helicopter sent a distress signal and requested permission from Greek authorities for an emergency landing, and landed eight minutes later (00:50) at the Dimokritos airport in Alexandroupoli, in Greece, while two Greek F-16s observed the procedure and escorted it to the airport.The first reports said that the passengers were seven military personnel and a civilian.Later, it turned out that all were military personnel (two majors, four captains and two non-commissioned officers).They had removed the badges and insignia from their uniforms, making it impossible to know their rank.All were arrested after landing for illegal entry into the country.They were transferred to the local police station, while the Greek authorities at the airport guarded the helicopter.The eight passengers all requested political asylum in Greece as they believed they would not get a fair trial in Turkey.On 21 September 2016, Greece denied three out of the eight asylum.The men\'s lawyer Stavroula Tomara said they would be appealing the decision and said they had the ""impression that the decision has been predetermined, and that the interview was conducted just as a formality.""On 11 October 2016, four more of the eight were denied asylum.Two of the men who had previously been denied asylum applied for a re-evaluation but their applications were also rejected.\n\nAfter Erdoğan flew into Istanbul, he made a televised speech inside the airport at around 04:00, whilst thousands gathered outside.He addressed a crowd of supporters in the airport, at about 06:30 He said, ""In Turkey, armed forces are not governing the state or leading the state.They cannot.""He blamed ""those in Pennsylvania"" (a reference to Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, and his Hizmet Movement) for the coup attempt.Erdoğan also said he had plans to ""clean up"" the army, saying that ""This uprising is a gift from God to us.""State-run Anadolu Agency named former Colonel Muharrem Köse, who in March 2016 was dishonorably discharged for reported association with Gülen, as the suspected leader of the coup.However, the Alliance for Shared Values, a non-profit organization associated with Gülen, released a statement reiterating that it condemns any military intervention in domestic politics, and saying Erdoğan\'s allegations against the movement were ""highly irresponsible"".Gülen himself said in a brief statement just before midnight: ""As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nReuters reported that in early hours of 16 July, the coup appeared to have ""crumbled"" as crowds defied pro-coup military orders and gathered in major squares of Istanbul and Ankara to oppose it.Reuters also reported pro-coup soldiers surrendering to the police in Taksim Square, Istanbul.It was reported that by 05:18, Atatürk airport had completely been recaptured by the government whilst the police had surrounded the coupists inside the Turkish army headquarters, calling for them to surrender.Between 06:00–08:00 a skirmish took place there.In Akar\'s absence, Ümit Dündar, head of the First Army, was appointed Acting Chief of Staff.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning of 16 July, soldiers blocking the Bosphorus Bridge surrendered to the police.According to the government-run Anadolu Agency, this consisted of a group of 50 soldiers.Some of these soldiers were lynched by civilians despite the police\'s efforts, who fired into the air to protect the surrendering soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile, in the headquarters of the Turkish Army, 700 unarmed soldiers surrendered as the police conducted an operation into the building while 150 armed soldiers were kept inside by the police.The coupists in the TRT building in Istanbul surrendered in the early morning as well.Chief of Staff Akar, held hostage at the Akıncı Air Base in Ankara, was also rescued by pro-state forces.\n\nOne of the primary reasons that the coup failed was chaos among the plotters\' ranks.Turkey\'s National Intelligence Organization (MİT) head Hakan Fidan discovered the coup plot, and the plotters were forced to execute the coup five hours ahead of schedule.One of the main organizers, General Semih Terzi, was shot dead by loyalist Sgt.Maj.Ömer Halisdemir at the onset, demoralizing and disrupting command and control of the rebels.These two incidents resulted in the coup being carried out in an uncoordinated manner.The highest ranking staff officers opposed the coup, and publicly ordered all personnel to return to their barracks.Acting outside the military chain of command, the rebels lacked the coordination and resources to achieve their goals.The conscripted soldiers that the rebels mobilized were uninformed of their mission\'s true purpose and became demoralized.Many surrendered rather than shoot demonstrators.The commander of the First Army in Istanbul, General Ümit Dündar, personally called Erdoğan to warn him of the plot, persuading him to evacuate his hotel ahead of the plotters, and helped to secure Istanbul for Erdoğan to land.The MİT also mobilized its anti-aircraft guns, which the plotters were unaware existed, deterring rebel jets and commando teams.\n\nEqually important to the coup\'s failure, according to military strategist Edward N. Luttwak, was the inability of the rebels to neutralize Erdoğan and other high ranking government officials, either by killing or detaining them.A unit of special forces was sent via helicopter to kill or capture the president, but missed because he had been evacuated by his security detail just minutes before.Once Erdoğan landed at Atatürk International Airport (which had been recaptured from the rebels by his supporters), It became highly unlikely that the coup attempt would succeed.According to a military source, several rebel F-16s targeted Erdoğan\'s presidential jet en route to Istanbul, but they did not fire.A senior Turkish counter-terrorism official later stated that the jets did not fire because the fighter jet pilots were told by President Erdoğan\'s pilot over the radio that the (flight of the) Gulfstream IV was a Turkish Airlines flight.\n\nAccording to Naunihal Singh, author of Seizing Power, the coup attempt also failed because the plotters failed to secure control of the media and shape the narrative.Successful coups require that the rebels control the mass media.This allows even small rebel contingents to portray themselves as fully in control, and their victory as inevitable.Consequently, they convince the public, along with neutral and even loyalist soldiers, to defect to them or not resist.The rebels failed to properly broadcast their messages effectively across the media that they controlled.They failed to capture Türksat, Turkey\'s main cable and satellite communications company, and failed to gain control of the country\'s television and mobile phone networks.This allowed Erdoğan to make his Facetime call, and to speak on television.\n\nOther scholars of civil-military relations, like Drew H. Kinney, have said reports like Luttwak and Singh\'s miss the point of their own analysis: civil resistance thwarted the coup.Luttwak argues that wayward elements of the Turkish armed forces could not silence Erdoğan.Singh says that the rebels could not project success because they couldn\'t control the message.Kinney states that neither of these reasons on their own matter, but rather it\'s their effect—civil disobedience—that is important.We might find that ""[Gülen\'s movement] ...[might] have had nothing to do with the attempted takeover in July, but civilians [nevertheless] definitely played a role in thwarting the coup,"" writes Kinney.""...[A]n unhappy civilian populace mobilized to face down the military.""\n\nErdoğan wasn\'t censored (Luttwak\'s point) and was therefore able to use FaceTime to mobilize resistance, which in turn hindered the conspirators\' ability to project success (Singh\'s point).The result is civilian resistance to soldiers, i.e., people power.The reason Singh, Luttwak, and other scholars of civil-military relations miss this is, according to Kinney, because they ""usually do not study extra-military reasons for coup failures/successes,"" but rather put a premium on ""the inner-workings of the [military] operation.""In short, they blame the military for its failure rather than acknowledge the power of the masses and their successes.\n\nPro-state forces sent text messages to every Turkish citizen calling for them to protest against the coup attempt.Throughout the night sela prayers were repeatedly called from mosque minarets across the country to encourage people to resist the coup plotters.While the sela is usually called from minarets to inform the public of a funeral, they are also traditionally performed to notify of a significant event, in this case ""to rally people"".\n\nThe coup plotters initiated their operation hours ahead of the planned time when they understood that their plans had been compromised.Had the coup been launched at its original time, the middle of the night, much of the population would have been asleep.The streets would have been mostly empty.\n\nReports have emerged, neither confirmed nor denied by Russia or Turkey that the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate intercepted signals on an imminent coup passed on to loyal Turkish operatives.The intercepted plans revealed several helicopters with commandos were on the way to Marmaris\'s coastal resort, where Erdoğan stayed, capturing or killing him.Pre-warned, Erdoğan left quickly to avoid them.\n\nAn extensive purge of the Turkish civil service began in the wake of the coup attempt, with President Erdoğan warning his opponents that ""they will pay a heavy price for this.""The New York Times along with some other Western media such as The Economist, described the purges as a ""counter-coup"", with the Times expecting the president to ""become more vengeful and obsessed with control than ever, exploiting the crisis not just to punish mutinous soldiers but to further quash whatever dissent is left in Turkey,"".As of 20 July 2016, the purge already had seen over 45,000 military officials, police officers, judges, governors and civil servants arrested or suspended, including 2,700 judges, 15,000 teachers, and every university dean in the country.\n\n163 generals and admirals were detained, around 45% of the Turkish military\'s total.\n\nOn 18 July 2016, United States State Secretary John Kerry urged Turkish authorities to halt the increasing crackdown on its citizens, indicating that the crackdown was meant to ""suppress dissent.""French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault voiced concern, warning against a ""political system which turns away from democracy"" in response to the purges.\n\nOn 17 August 2016, Turkey started releasing what was expected to eventually amount to about 38,000 prison inmates, to make more space in the penal system for detainees, numbering about 35,000, who were arrested or detained after being involved in or suspected of association, with the 2016 failed coup.\n\nOn 28 September 2016, Turkish justice minister Bekir Bozdağ said 70,000 people had been processed and 32,000 were formally arrested.\n\nMajor General Cahit Bakir, who commanded Turkish forces under NATO in Afghanistan, and Brigadier General Sener Topuc, responsible for education and aid in Afghanistan, were detained by authorities in Dubai connected with the failed coup.\n\nGeneral Akın Öztürk, former Commander of the Turkish Air Force, was the Turkish military attaché to Israel.He was arrested on charges of having played a leading role in the failed coup.Öztürk has denied the charges.\n\nGeneral Adem Huduti, the commander of the Second Army, positioned along the southern borders with Syria and Iraq, and General Erdal Öztürk, the commander of the 3rd Corps, were also arrested.\n\nRear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been stationed at NATO\'s Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk, Virginia, sought asylum in the United States after being recalled by the Turkish government.\n\nIn July 2018, Istanbul\'s 25th Criminal Court sentenced 72 former soldiers involved in the coup attempt to life in prison.\n\nOn 20 June 2019, a terrorism court in Turkey sentenced 151 people to life in prison, including General Akın Öztürk, former commander of Turkish Air Force and the most senior officer involved in the coup.128 people received ""aggravated life"" sentences, which indicates harsh conditions without parole, for their role in the coup, with another 23 receiving standard life sentences.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom President Erdoğan said as one of the principal conspirators, condemned the coup attempt and denied any role in it.""I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey,"" he said in an emailed statement reported by The New York Times.""Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force.I pray to God for Turkey, Turkish citizens, and all those currently in Turkey that this situation is resolved peacefully and quickly.As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nPresident Erdoğan asked the United States to extradite Gülen: ""I call on you again, after there was a coup attempt.Extradite this man in Pennsylvania to Turkey!If we are strategic partners or model partners, do what is necessary.""Prime Minister Yildirim has threatened war against any country that would support Gülen.Turkish Labor Minister Süleyman Soylu said that ""America is behind the coup.""\n\nRegarding the AKP\'s statement against Gülen, Secretary of State Kerry invited the Turkish government ""to present us with any legitimate evidence that withstands scrutiny,"" before they would accept an extradition request.\n\nOn 15 August 2016, former United States diplomat James Jeffrey, who was the United States ambassador to Turkey from 2008 until 2010 made the following remarks: ""The Gülen movement has some infiltration at the least in the military that I am aware of.They of course had extreme infiltration into the police and judiciary earlier.I saw that when I was in Turkey previously, particularly in the Sledgehammer case, Hakan Fidan case, and the corruption cases in 2013.Obviously, significant segment of Turkey\'s bureaucracy was infiltrated and had their allegiance to a movement.That of course is absolutely unacceptable and extremely dangerous.It likely led to the coup attempt.""\n\nOutside Turkey, in Beringen, Belgium, anti-coup protesters attempted to attack a building owned by the pro-Gülen movement group \'Vuslat\'.The police brought in a water cannon to keep the attackers at bay.In news articles it was stated that the police also protected the houses of Gülen supporters.People advocated on social media to go to Beringen once more, and there was unrest in Heusden-Zolder, elsewhere in Belgium.Furthermore, in Somalia the government ordered ""the total closure of all activities"" of an organization linked to the Gülen movement, and gave its staff seven days to leave the country.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, President Erdoğan said Western countries were ""supporting terrorism"" and the military coup, saying ""I\'m calling on the United States: what kind of strategic partners are we, that you can still host someone whose extradition I have asked for?""\n\nOn 31 January 2017, British Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, Alan Duncan said he believed the Gülen movement was responsible for the coup attempt.Duncan went on saying ""the organization which incorporated itself into the state tried to topple the democratic structure in Turkey"".\n\nIn a speech on 29 July 2016, President Erdoğan said U.S. Central Command chief Joseph Votel was ""siding with coup plotters""; Erdoğan said the United States was protecting Fethullah Gülen, whom the Turkish government blames for the coup attempt.Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim made similar comments.In response, Votel said that the Turkish government\'s statements were ""unfortunate and completely inaccurate"" and expressed concern that the mass arrests and firings of military officers would damage military cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey.Similarly, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said that the Turkish military purges were impairing the fight against ISIS.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, in an escalation of tensions with the United States, Erdoğan questioned Turkey\'s relationship with the United States and criticized the West, saying that ""script"" for the abortive putsch last month was ""written abroad"".Erdoğan stated that he had personally asked Obama to extradite Gülen to Turkey.When the U.S. government replied it would need evidence of the cleric\'s guilt before extradition, to which Erdoğan said: ""When you asked for the return of a terrorist, we did not ask for documentation. ...Let us put him on trial.""\n\nYeni Şafak daily, a Turkish pro-state newspaper, stated that the former commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, now-retired United States Army General John F. Campbell, was the ""mastermind"" behind the coup attempt in Turkey.Campbell called the statement ""absolutely ridiculous"" and President Obama said ""Any reports that we had any previous knowledge of a coup attempt, that there was any U.S. involvement in it, that we were anything other than entirely supportive of Turkish democracy are completely false, unequivocally false.""\n\nOn 1 December 2017, Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for American political analyst, former CIA official and former vice chairman of US National Intelligence Council Graham Fuller, stating his involvement in the coup.A career US State Department official who was once CIA Station Chief in Kabul and later went on to be a political scientist in Rand Corporation specializing in the Middle East, Turkish authorities said Fuller attended a meeting in Istanbul on 15 July 2016 involving organization and coordination of the botched coup.Another American among the attendance, as stated by the Turkish prosecutors, was academic Henri Barkey who was named a suspect a week after the failed coup.\n\nThe U.S. consulate in Turkey issued an advisory to U.S. citizens to avoid the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey, which houses about 50 nuclear bombs, until ""normal operations have been restored"".They stated that local authorities were denying access to the air base and that power supplying the air base was shut off.\n\nThe Incirlik base is important to the U.S.-led effort in Syria to combat ISIL and other militants.Nearly 1,500 American personnel are housed in the base.\n\nTwenty-four hours after initial reports that the air base was shut down, United States defense department officials confirmed that the base and its airspace had re-opened to military aircraft and that operations by American aircraft will resume.The Turkish commander of the air base, brig.Gen. Bekir Ercan Van was arrested.After the failure of the coup Gen Bekir Ercan Van sought asylum from the U.S., but his request was denied by U.S.\n\nFollowing the failed coup attempt multiple media outlets have published editorials advocating the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Incirlik Air base as Turkey is unstable.\n\nOn 16 July, anti-coup protesters chanted against locals in areas of Istanbul with high concentration of Alevis, including Okmeydanı and Gazi.Such incidents also occurred in a quarter of Antakya with a high Alevi population, where a motorcyclist stating to be a sharia advocate was lynched.In a neighbourhood of Ankara, shops belonging to Syrians were attacked by a mob.In Malatya, Sunni Islamists harassed residents of an Alevi neighbourhood, particularly the women, and attempted to enter the neighbourhood en masse.Police intervened and blocked all roads leading there.In Kadıköy, people drinking alcohol in public were attacked by a group of religious fundamentalists.\n\nFollowing the arrests, thousands of anti-coup protesters demanded instituting the death penalty against detainees connected with the coup, chanting ""we want the death penalty"".President Erdoğan has been open to reinstituting the death penalty, noting that ""in a democracy, whatever the people want they will get.""Turkish authorities have not executed anyone since 1984, but legally abolished capital punishment only in 2004 as a pre-condition to join the European Union.\n\nEuropean Union officials have been vocal about their opposition to purges by Turkish authorities in connection to the coup.French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that Turkey must work within the framework of the law to uphold Europe\'s democratic principles.Furthermore, on 18 July 2016, Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of Foreign Affairs of the European Union, announced that no country will be admitted into the European Union ""if it introduces the death penalty"".Moreover, German press secretary, Steffen Seibert, stated that reinstituting the death penalty will end Turkey\'s accession talks with the European Union.\n\nTurkey is a member of the Council of Europe, and ratified the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) as part of its terms of membership.The ECHR is an international treaty that includes the abolition of the death penalty among its terms.As such, Turkey is legally bound not to reintroduce the death penalty.\n\nOn 20 July 2016, President Erdoğan announced a three-month state of emergency in response to the attempted coup, invoking Article 120 of the Constitution of Turkey (""Declaration of state of emergency because of widespread acts of violence and serious deterioration of public order"").Under the state of emergency, under Article 121, ""the Council of Ministers, meeting under the chairpersonship of the President of the Republic, may issue decrees having the force of law on matters necessitated by the state of emergency"", with decrees subject to subsequent parliamentary approval.The state of emergency was endorsed by the Parliament on 21 July by 346 votes to 115.The Justice and Development Party and the Nationalist Movement Party supported the state of emergency, whilst the Republican People\'s Party and the Peoples\' Democratic Party opposed it.Prime Minister Yıldırım said at the Parliament that the state of emergency was necessary to ""get rid of this scourge rapidly"".\n\nAs part of the state of emergency, deputy prime minister Kurtulmuş announced that Turkey was temporarily suspending part of the European Convention on Human Rights following the attempted coup, invoking Article 15 of the Convention (""war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation"").The suspensions must be notified to the Council of Europe and may not affect the right to a fair trial or the prohibition on torture.\n\nThis state of emergency in Turkey as well as the hindrance of the right to protest that occurred within such framework have been layered onto a longer history of emergency rules, oppressive legislation and daily government practice that have reinforced both.We can see from this the ""autocratisation"" process in Turkey has thrived of existing legal framework deeply associated in legacies of past ""emergencies"".\n\nOn 3 October 2016 Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş declared the governments intention to extend the state of emergency by a further three months raising objections from both the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) and Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) were critical of the governments use of their emergency powers and declared that they would vote against an extension.\n\nFollowing the National Security Council\'s recommendation for the extension President Erdoğan stated that it was possible that the state of emergency could last for longer than a year prompting outcry from the opposition, Leader of the Main Opposition Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu said that ""The president saying that the state of emergency can last longer than 12 months is strengthening the fear of a counter-coup"" and that it was ""raising the prospect of opportunist measures.""\n\nThe AKP\'s governmental majority allowed the three-month extension to take effect on 19 October 2016.The two-year-long state of emergency was ended on 19 July 2018.\n\nOn 16 July 2016, the media reported that eight Turkish military personnel of various ranks had landed in Greece\'s northeastern city of Alexandroupolis on board a Black Hawk helicopter and claimed political asylum in Greece.While the Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu demanded extradition of ""the eight traitors as soon as possible"", the Greek authorities stated: ""We will follow the procedures of international law.However, we give severe considerations to the fact that [the Turkish military men] are accused, in their own country, of violating the constitutional order and trying to overthrow democracy.""The helicopter was returned to Turkey shortly thereafter.The eight asylum seekers, their asylum case pending, were later transferred to Athens, mainly for safety reasons.On 26 January, the Supreme Court of Greece eventually ruled against their extradition, on the grounds that the eight were unlikely to face a fair trial if returned to their home country and due to concerns over their safety.\n\nOn 15 February 2017, five Turkish commandos illegally entered Greece through the Evros river.However, once they entered the country, the group split.The two of them surrendered to the police and on 20 February 2017, requested political asylum.They were being held in the city of Alexandroupolis.The two men belonged to the Turkish navy.The names given by the two reportedly match the names of two fugitives wanted in relation to the shadowy operation against Erdoğan himself.The Greek government mentioned that the Greek authorities will not allow the country to be dragged into the ongoing feud between the Turkish state and the followers of Gulen.But there were no sign of the other three.According to a lawyer there were indications that the other three have been arrested by Greek authorities who were about to expel them to Turkey.According to new evidence and new information these three ""arrested"" marines were delivered under fast and informal procedures from Greek to Turkish services.\n\nAfter the coup attempt, two Turkish military attachés in Athens, Staff Col. İlhan Yaşıtlı and naval attaché Col. Halis Tunç, had reportedly disappeared along with their families.The Greek foreign ministry canceled the two attachés\' accreditations on 7 August 2016, upon the request of the Turkish foreign ministry.Greek media reported that they might have fled to Italy.On 11 August 2016, the Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu confirmed the reports saying that they had left Greece for Italy on 6 August and adding that Turkey would officially ask the Italian authorities to extradite the two soldiers.\n\nOn 9 August 2016, the media reported that Turkey\'s Rear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been on a United States-based assignment for NATO and after the coup was subject to a detention order in Turkey, had sought asylum in the United States.\n\nIn mid-November 2016, it was officially confirmed that about 40 Turkish military servicemen of various ranks stationed at NATO command structures had applied for asylum in Germany and Belgium.\n\nIn January 2017, Der Spiegel magazine and ARD broadcaster reported that about 40 mostly high-ranking Turkish soldiers who worked at NATO facilities in Germany requested asylum in Germany.\n\nAt the end of February 2017, Germany said it had received 136 asylum requests from Turks holding diplomatic passports since the July coup attempt.The figure was a total for August 2016 to January 2017; some were presumed to be military officers posted to NATO bases in Germany.\n\nIn November 2016, NATO\'s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that Turkish NATO Officers had requested asylum in the countries where they had been posted.He did not name the nations involved or the number of officers, saying it was a matter for those countries to decide.He said: ""Some Turkish officers working in NATO command structure ... have requested asylum in the countries where they are working. ...As always, this is an issue that is going to be assessed and decided by the different NATO allies as a national issue.""\n\nAs of March 2017, Norway have granted asylum for four Turkish soldiers and a military attache.\n\nSeveral Turkish citizens with diplomatic passports have sought political asylum in Switzerland.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, detainees in Turkey have been denied access to legal counsel, have been beaten and tortured.They have not been provided with adequate food, water, or medical care.At least one has attempted suicide.Amnesty International wanted the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture to send people to check on detainees conditions.A person who had been on duty at the Ankara police headquarters said that police denied medical treatment to a detainee.""Let him die.We will say he came to us dead,"" the witness quoted a police doctor as saying.\n\nAlso, Erdoğan has extended the maximum period of detention for suspects from four days to 30, a move Amnesty said increased the risk of torture or other maltreatment of detainees.\n\nTurkish Justice Ministry denied the reports and the Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said on his Twitter account: ""There has not been any torture or assault of detainees in custody,"" in response to reports by Amnesty International.""The claims of torture and assault make up a pre-packaged misinformation campaign formed by members of FETÖ, one which is untrue and distorted,""\n\nOn 7 August, between three and five million people gathered for an anti-coup rally organized by the Turkish authorities in Istanbul.President Erdoğan and the two leaders of the major opposition parties (the Republican People\'s Party and the Nationalist Movement Party) were present.\n\nGreek authorities on several Aegean islands have called for emergency measures to curtail a growing flow of refugees from Turkey; the number of migrants and refugees willing to make the journey across the Aegean has increased noticeably after the failed coup.At Athens officials voiced worries because Turkish monitors overseeing the deal in Greece had been abruptly pulled out after the failed coup without being replaced.Also, the mayor of Kos expressed concern in a letter to the Greek Prime Minister citing the growing influx of refugees and migrants after the failed coup.The Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises (SETE) warned about the prospect of another flare-up in the refugee/migrant crisis due to the Turkish political instability.\n\nVincent Cochetel, the director of the Europe Bureau of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in August 2016 that parts of the EU-Turkey deal about immigration were already de facto suspended because no Turkish police were present at Greek detention centres to oversee deportations.\n\nOn 25 August 2016, seven Turkish citizens sought asylum in Greece.Two were university professors, and their two children applied for asylum in Alexandroupoli after they illegally entered the country from the northeastern border.Also, three businessmen illegally reached the Greek island of Rhodes, and they also applied for asylum.\n\nOn 30 August 2016, a Turkish judge arrived at the Greek island of Chios on a migrant boat, with six Syrian nationals, and sought asylum in the country.He told the Greek coastguard and police officers that he is being persecuted in Turkey for his political beliefs by President Tayyip Erdoğan.The Turkish judge had been arrested for illegally entering the country and was transferred to Athens for his asylum proceedings.The Syrian nationals claimed refugee status.\n\nOn 11 September 2016, four Turkish civilians were arrested by Turkish police.An academic and a teacher attempted to escape to Greece illegally by crossing the Evros river, and the other two because they organized the escape attempt.The academic and the teacher paid a total of 12,500 euros in Istanbul to arrange their escape to Greece.Before their attempt, both the academic and the teacher were suspended from their duties as part of the ongoing probe into the failed coup attempt.Police also seized an air raft, an oar and a pump while detaining the suspects.The court later ordered the two\'s release while the other two suspects, who organized the escape attempt, were arrested.\n\nOn 21 September 2016, ten Turkish civilians, two men, two women and six children landed by boat illegally on the Greek island of Rhodes and sought asylum.They told the Greek authorities they were working in the private sector in Turkey and the Turkish government was persecuting them due to their political beliefs.\n\nOn 29 September 2016, five Turkish nationals, a couple and their child and two other men, arrived in Greece, at Alexandroupolis by crossing the Evros River by boat illegally and requested political asylum.\n\nOn 12 December 2016, one female Turkish national, landed by boat, full of refugees and immigrants, illegally on the Greek island of Lesbos.She requested political asylum.\n\nOn 24 October 2017, Turkish authorities obtained information that 995 Turks have applied for asylum in Greece after the coup attempt.\n\nMore than 1,800 Turkish citizens requested asylum in Greece in 2017.\n\nOn 18 February 2018, seventeen Turkish nationals, including six children, requested asylum in Greece at Oinousses island.\n\nIn August 2018, the former lawmaker for the Peoples\' Democratic Party, Leyla Birlik, requested asylum in Greece after illegally crossing the border near Alexandroupolis.\n\nBerlin mayor, Michael Müller (SPD), said Turkey was waging war on supporters of the Gülen movement in Germany.He said that Turkish officials had approached him and asked him whether he would be prepared to confront the Gülen movement in Berlin critically and, if necessary, to support measures against it.The mayor rejected the idea and made it very clear that Turkish conflicts could not be waged in the city.\n\nDer Spiegel presented classified documents, which showed that Turkey\'s secret service (MIT) had asked Germany\'s foreign intelligence agency (BND) for help in rounding up Gülen supporters in Germany.The Turkish secret service wanted the BND to use its influence to spur German lawmakers into taking action against Gülen supporters and extraditing them to Turkey.Also, Turkey\'s government has sent German authorities requests for searches and extraditions linked to supporters of Fethullah Gülen in Germany.\n\nIn Germany businesses thought to be in support of the Gülen movement have been harassed by Erdoğan supporters.\n\nAfter the failed coup, there was a massive demonstration in Cologne at Germany, in late July, in support of Turkish President Erdoğan.Erdoğan wanted to address the participants via video but was rejected by the local authorities and the German Constitutional Court due to security concerns.Turkey said that the ban was unacceptable and a violation of freedom of expression.\n\nGerman authorities said Turkish mosques in Germany were playing Turkish politics and worried that Turkey\'s internal politics spilled over into German cities.For years, German authorities had encouraged Turkey\'s state-run religious institution Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs usually referred to as DİTİB to provide Islamic preachers and teachers and Gülen Movement Schools for the large Turkish diaspora in Germany.DİTİB manages some 900 mosques in Germany.Gülen movement runs 100 educational facilities in Germany.\n\nAfter the failed coup DİTİB published a sermon praising ""our noble nation"" for rising against ""a wretched network"" that had sown ""seeds of sedition, rebellion and hostility.""According to Volker Beck, a member of the center-left Greens in Germany\'s Bundestag, ""That was not a religious text.It was a declaration of obedience to Mr. Erdoğan and his measures since the coup attempt,"" Volker Kauder, parliamentary group leader of the Germany\'s ruling Christian Democrats, the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU)/Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) faction, said Turkish-Germans should be loyal to Germany first and foremost.\n\nGermans of Turkish origin are being pressured in Germany by informers and officers of Turkey\'s MIT spy agency.According to reports Turkey had 6,000 informants plus MIT officers in Germany who were putting pressure on ""German Turks"".Hans-Christian Ströbele said that there was an ""unbelievable"" level of ""secret activities"" in Germany by Turkey\'s MIT agency.According to Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, not even the former communist East German Stasi secret police had managed to run such a large ""army of agents"" in the former West Germany: ""Here, it\'s not just about intelligence gathering, but increasingly about intelligence service repression.""\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nGermany\'s Office for Migration and Refugees said on 18 November 2016, it had received 4,437 political asylum requests from Turkish citizens up to October, compared to 1,767 for the whole of last year.""We must expect that the number of Turks who are seeking political asylum in Germany will continue to rise,"" said Stephan Mayer, the domestic policy speaker of the union coalition in the Bundestag.\n\nOn 10 December 2016, eleven Turkish nationals, 10 adults and one child, in a martial arts group have applied for asylum in Germany.\n\nAs of January 2018, Germany was first place and Greece second as EU destinations of choice for Turkish nationals requesting asylum after the coup attempt.\n\nTurkish police have carried out simultaneous raids in 18 cities against companies associated with United States-based Fethullah Gülen.The state-run Anadolu Agency said police searched 204 premises and detained 187 businessmen for ""membership in a terror organization"" and ""providing financial support to a terror organization"".All suspects\' assets were seized.\n\nWikiLeaks released Turkish emails and documents to respond to the Turkish government\'s purges that followed the coup attempt.In turn, the Turkish Telecommunications Communications Board blocked access to the WikiLeaks website.On 17 July 2016 Wikileaks had announced on Twitter, the leak of approximately 300,000 emails and over 500,000 documents, including those to and from AKP.\n\nWikiLeaks stated that it was attacked shortly after 17 July announcement of the planned publication and hypothesized that Turkish authorities were responsible.WikiLeaks stated in a tweet, ""our infrastructure is under sustained attack.""Tweets from WikiLeaks include ""We are unsure of the true origin of the attack.The timing suggests a Turkish state power faction or its allies.We will prevail & publish.""and: ""Turks will likely be censored to prevent them reading our pending release of 100k+ docs on politics leading up to the coup."", ""We ask that Turks are ready with censorship bypassing systems such as TorBrowser and uTorrent""; ""And that everyone else is ready to help them bypass censorship and push our links through the censorship to come.""\n\nUpon the release of the email dump, it has been reported that the emails contain little to no damning information, and instead are just mails from a public mailing list, but also linked externally to ""voter information on all of the women registered to vote in 78 out of Turkey\'s 81 provinces"".\n\nSeveral places were renamed to commemorate the failed coup: Boğaziçi Köprüsü (Bosphorus Bridge) → 15 Temmuz Şehitler Köprüsü Kızılay Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Kızılay Demokrasi Meydanı Ahmet Taner Kışlalı Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Milli İrade Meydanı (Reverted to original name a few days later) Büyük İstanbul Otogarı → İstanbul 15 Temmuz Demokrasi Otogarı In TRT, Yeni Haber Stüdyosu → 15 Temmuz Millet Stüdyosu Kazan → Kahramankazan about the province\'s local people\'s resistance to the coup plotters.Kahraman means ""hero"" in Turkish Niğde University → Niğde Ömer Halisdemir University\n\nIn 2018, the Istanbul Municipal Council decided to change the names of a total of 90 streets that included words which could be associated with FETÖ.\n\nThe Presidency of Religious Affairs stated that it would not be providing religious funeral services to the dead coupists, except for ""privates and low-ranking officers compelled by force and threats who found themselves in the midst of the conflict without full knowledge of anything"".\n\nA document dated 26 September 2016 showed that Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) asked Turkish missions and religious representatives abroad to profile Gülen movement expatriates living in their respective foreign countries.Gülen-linked schools, businesses, foundations, associations, media outlets and others were also included in the reports.Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs has gathered intelligence via imams from 38 countries.\n\nBelgium officials said they would withdraw recognition of Diyanet mosques in the country if necessary.\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nOn 21 December 2016, the Turkish government has recalled Yusuf Acar, the religious affairs attaché of the Turkish Embassy in the Netherlands, after Dutch authorities said he was spying.Acar collected information of people who sympathize with Fethullah Gülen at Netherlands and passed it on to the Turkish authorities.The Dutch government called spying activities an ""unwanted and non-acceptable interference in the lives of Dutch citizens.""and the attaché was reportedly declared persona non grata and received a ""deportation warning"" by Dutch authorities.\n\nOn 26 January 2017, President Erdoğan, during his visit to Tanzania, asked his Tanzanian counterpart John Magufuli to take action against the network of Fethullah Gülen.\n\nIn April 2017 it was announced that President Erdoğan planned to establish a purpose-built museum dedicated to the coup events, called the ""Museum of the 15 July: Martyrs and Democracy"", to be located in Kahramankazan, a town near Ankara.Paid for by Turkish Ministry of Culture funds, it is planned to open at the end of 2018.The museum opened in December 2019\n\nAmong the Turkish opposition parties, the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) issued a statement expressing their public opposition to the coup, and the Hürriyet Daily News reported that Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bahçeli telephoned Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım to express his opposition to the coup.The co-chairs of the opposition Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) issued a statement saying that the party was ""under all circumstances and as a matter of principle against all kinds of coup.""Amongst the minor parties, left-wing nationalist Patriotic Party\'s Doğu Perinçek backed democracy, when he held Gülen and the Americans responsible.Kurdish militant separatist organization Kurdistan Workers\' Party, which Turkey and its allies label as a terrorist organization, urged their supporters to stay away from the coup and rather defend their people, while the Communist Party called upon the people to overthrow the AKP government which they called an ""enemy of humanity"".\n\nDuring the first hours of the coup plotters\' moves of blocking Istanbul\'s bridges and flying fighter jets low over Istanbul and Ankara, Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjørn Jagland tweeted against the coup attempt and underlined that ""any attempt to overthrow the democratically elected leaders is unacceptable"".\n\nRussia\'s President Vladimir Putin called Erdoğan out of solidarity before all NATO member countries\' heads following the coup attempt.Erdoğan thanked the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev – who was the first president to show solidarity after the coup attempt – for his support in solving the 7-month crisis over downed Russian Sukhoi Su-24 and the Prime Minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, who was among the first NATO country leaders to condemn the coup attempt, already from the early hours of Saturday.\n\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the then prime minister of Pakistan, was all praise for the people of Turkey and the AKP government and strongly condemned what he termed as an attempt to undermine democracy in Turkey.""We deeply admire the resolve of the brave and resilient Turkish people, who stood up against the forces of darkness and anarchy to express their support and commitment to democracy,"" the PM said in a statement issued from his office.\n\nThe majority of countries either expressed their support for the government or called for restraint.On 16 July 2016, however, a proposed United Nations Security Council statement denouncing the coup was not accepted by Egypt, a non-permanent member of the Council at the time, due to textual disagreements.Egyptian diplomats said that the council is ""in no position to qualify, or label [the Turkish] government – or any other government for that matter – as democratically elected or not"".Objection by the United States and the UK – permanent members of the Security Council – led to Egypt proposing a new statement calling for all sides to ""respect the democratic and constitutional principles and the rule of law"", which was rejected, preventing the condemnation of the coup attempt by the Security Council.The leader of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky supported the coup attempt.\n\nAl-Monitor reported that ""Unlike Ankara\'s Western allies, Iran did not wait for the coup\'s failure to speak up.Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif voiced support for democracy in a Twitter message in the early hours of the unrest, writing ""Stability, and democracy in Turkey are paramount"".In a subsequent phone call after the failure of the coup attempt, President Hassan Rouhani told Erdoğan the coup attempt was ""a test to identify your domestic and foreign friends and enemies.""An Iranian official pointed out parallels between the coup attempt in Turkey and the coup against Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mussadiq in 1953: ""What we know is that this attempt was triggered by foreign hands.We have experienced the same thing in the past.Since Mr. Erdogan wants to play a more positive path in the region today, they want to overthrow him.""\n\nMustafa Akıncı, President of Northern Cyprus, welcomed the fact that ""no community in Turkey ... applauded the coup as they have done in the past.""Azerbaijan strongly condemned the attempted military coup in Turkey and considered such actions unacceptable according to a statement from Novruz Mammadov, deputy head of the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration and chief of the foreign relations department.\n\nEuropean Commissioner dealing with Turkey\'s EU membership bid, Johannes Hahn, said it appears Turkey\'s government prepared arrest lists of political opponents before the coup attempt and had been waiting for the right time to act.In this sense, EU reported that as a main criticism to put this issue in the category of terrorism become the violation of the fundamental rights and fundamental values of the citizens.Hence, it underlines a total divergence of opinions and mentality between EU and Turkey which reached a deadlock here especially after the 15th of July in 2016.\n\nOn 19 July 2016, White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said during a press briefing that President Barack Obama has held a phone conversation with President Erdoğan: ""The President used the phone call to reiterate once again the strong commitment of the United States to the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey.The President pledged any needed assistance to the Turkish government as they conduct an investigation to determine exactly what happened.""\n\nOn 20 July 2016, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""Turkey has a large armed force, professional armed forces and ...I am certain they will continue as a committed and strong NATO ally.""On a statement released on 10 August 2016, the Secretary General once more strongly condemned the attempted coup and reiterated full support for Turkey\'s democratic institutions.He also expressed support for the elected Turkish government and respect for the courage of the Turkish people for resisting the coup plotters.\n\nOn 29 July 2016, the commander of U.S. Central Command, General Joseph Votel, denied statements by Turkey\'s president Erdoğan that he has supported the coup attempt in Turkey.\n\nOn 1 August 2016, United States Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, General Joseph Dunford, visited Turkey and condemned the coup attempt.Dunford said: ""The consistent theme throughout the day was a reaffirmation of the importance of the U.S.-Turkey relationship – the need for us to cooperate.""\n\nOn July, 20, there were reports that a group of Turkish military commandos coup fugitives would try to cross from Turkey to the island of Symi, in the southeastern Aegean, at Greece.The Hellenic Coast Guard was on alert and increased the patrols in the area, especially after a group of inflatable dinghies and other vessels were seen departing from Datça, on the Turkish coast, in the direction of Symi, they monitored the movements of the Turkish vessels, which remained in Turkish waters.Furthermore, a contingent of the Hellenic Police was dispatched to Symi to conduct checks there.The Greek government had been anticipating a possible attempt by participants in the failed coup to come to Greece and took the reports seriously.Turkish F-16 fighter jets were also scrambled to check reports that missing Turkish coast guard vessels had appeared in Greek waters in the Aegean.Later on the day, the Turkish interior ministry denied reports that rebel soldiers might have ""hijacked"" a vessel to flee to Greece.The Greek armed forces remained on alert the throughout the day for potential coup fugitives.\n\nAccording to Michael Rubin, from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Erdoğan had himself to blame for the coup.Following an increasingly Islamist agenda, Erdoğan had reportedly ""dropped any pretense of governing for all Turks.""After ""fanning the flames"" at the 2013 Gezi Park protests, he transformed the predominantly Kurdish-inhabited areas of southeastern Turkey ""into a war zone reminiscent of the worst days of the 1980s.""The biggest problem, according to Rubin, might have been Erdoğan\'s foreign policy, which managed to turn the initial ""no problems with neighbors"" doctrine into a situation where the country has problems with almost every neighbor and has even alienated some of its allies and friends.Rubin previously worked as an official at the Pentagon and less than 4 months before the coup, he wrote an article in Newsweek magazine titled, ""Will There Be a Coup Against Erdogan in Turkey?""\n\nBritish Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk warned that ""too late did Erdoğan realize the cost of the role he had chosen for his country.It\'s one thing to say sorry to Putin and patch up relations with Netanyahu; but when you can no longer trust your army, there are more serious matters to concentrate upon.""Even if this coup may have failed, Fisk expected another to follow in the months or years to come.\n\nTurkish professor Akın Ünver described the coup d\'état attempt as ""more of a mutiny"".\n\nThe name of the ""Peace at Home Council"" – Yurtta Sulh Konseyi – is derived from Atatürk\'s famous saying \'Peace at Home, Peace in the World\'.Journalist Ezgi Başaran said that ""the statement of the junta, that was [...] read on the [...] government TV [channel] as the coup got under way, bore a strong resemblance to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk\'s famous address to the Turkish Youth.[...] On the other hand, given that these references are too obvious, they may have been intentionally included to insinuate a Kemalist junta rather than a Gülenist one.""\n\nThe citizen journalism site Bellingcat published an analysis of the messages of a WhatsApp group consisting of high-ranking military officials who had taken part in the coup covering their activities including them killing several people.The messages were cross referenced with video footage.The group was named ""Yurtta sulh"" which refers to a peace at home speech and they seem secular and military with no references to Gülen or anything related during the several hours of messaging.\n\nNews reports have suggested that the coup ringleader was Adil Öksüz.Some believe Öksüz to have been an operative with Turkish intelligence.\n\nGerman Islamic studies scholar said the putschists tried to forestall a large-scale purge of judiciary and military, the implementation of which had already started on Saturday, the day after the coup attempt.According to Turkish investigative journalist Ahmet Şık, a list of officials to be purged had been ready compiled by the attorney-general of Izmir, Okan Bato, and was approved by President Erdoğan.According to this version, the putschists had to quickly bring forward their coup attempt before being disposed and arrested.\n\nDuring and after the events, several politicians and commentators suggested that the government knew about the coup in advance and possibly directed it.The facts that the coup attempt began in the evening rather than at a more inconspicuous time and that the events were largely confined to Ankara and Istanbul contributed to doubts about the authenticity of the coup attempt.Journalists and opposition politicians branded it a \'tragic comedy\' and \'theatre play\'.Advocates of such theories pointed to how Erdoğan stood to gain from the coup attempt in terms of increasing his popularity and support for his calls for an executive presidency, while being able to legitimize further crackdowns on judicial independence and the opposition in general.\n\nOther elements that were reported to support the theory included: no list of demands by the coup plotters, the organization and response of the police, the long lists of arrests that seemed to be ready surprisingly quickly (including arrests of 2,745 judges and 2,839 soldiers), and the obvious nature of the coup actions.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom Erdoğan had said as being one of the principal conspirators, commented, ""I don\'t believe that the world believes the accusations made by President Erdoğan.There is a possibility that it could be a staged coup and it could be meant for further accusations [against the Gülenists].""Journalist Cengiz Çandar, a veteran observer of Turkey\'s coups, said ""I have never seen any with this magnitude of such inexplicable sloppiness.""Prominent Hizmet (Gülen movement) spokesman Alp Aslandogan said, referencing that the Turkish Air Force commander met with Erdoğan before 15 July, that certain legal documentation related to the coup seemed written beforehand, arguing that within ""the indictment written by a prosecutor on the night of 15 July to 16 July, there were events there that didn\'t actually happen.Some events did happen, but those events didn\'t happen by the time the document started.It looks like a bigger plan was there, and part of the plan did not come to pass.""\n\nThe organization and spontaneous synchronization by large numbers of mosques was perceived to be unachievable unless there had been prior preparation, with journalists also pointing to how Erdoğan could have strategically used the call to prayer to invoke religious sentiment in a political situation as a veiled attack on state secularism.\n\nThousands of arrests and purges were conducted by Turkish authorities between 16 and 18 July 2016.The sheer number of these arrests made at such a speed could only be done so if the ""Turkish government had all those lists ready"", as suggested by Johannes Hahn, European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, on 18 July 2016.Hahn also said that because these lists were already available immediately after the coup, the ""event was prepared"" and the lists were to be used ""at a certain stage"".\n\nMehmet Dişli, who was seen giving orders to the coup plotters and who was the one who put a belt around Hulusi Akar\'s neck to make him sign, is the brother of Şaban Dişli, a former vice president of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and confidant of Erdoğan.\n\nSeveral social media users have compared the coup attempt to the Reichstag fire in 1933, which Adolf Hitler used as an excuse to suspend civil liberties and order mass arrests of his opponents.Politico correspondent Ryan Heath said that ""the coup was staged to allow Erdoğan to purge the military of opponents and increase his grip on the country"".Heath used Twitter to share comments from his Turkish source, who called the events of Friday night a ""fake coup"" which would help a ""fake democracy warrior"" (referring to Erdoğan).The source said: ""Probably we\'ll see an early election [in] which he\'ll try to guarantee an unbelievable majority of the votes.And this will probably guarantee another 10–15 years of authoritarian, elected dictatorship.""\n\nThe New York Times reported that some Turkish citizens believed the coup attempt was staged by Erdoğan to improve his public image and popularity, while cracking down on political opponents and expanding his power.Critics found it suspect that reportedly no government officials were arrested or harmed during the attempted coup, which—among other factors—raised the suspicion of a false flag event staged by the Turkish government to crack down on opposition parties.Those in Turkey suggesting that the coup was staged are also being questioned by the government.\n\nPoliticians and journalists who were skeptical of the authenticity of the coup plot said that in reality, a \'civil coup\' had effectively been staged against the Armed Forces and Judiciary, both of which were extensively purged of stated Gülen supporters by the government shortly after the events.Skeptics said that the coup would be used as an excuse for further erosion of judicial independence and a crackdown on the opposition, giving the AKP greater and unstoppable power over all state institutions and paving the way for a more radical Islamist agenda at odds with the founding principles of the Turkish Republic.\n\nJustice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said in late July 2016 that Turkish social media users who said the government was staging the coup faced investigation: ""Just look at the people who are saying on social media that this was theatre.Public prosecutors are already investigating them.Most of them are losers who think it is an honor to die for Fethullah Gülen\'s command.""\n\nOn 12 July 2017, Stockholm Center for Freedom, a monitoring group with reported links to the Gülen movement, published a controversial report stating that President Erdogan orchestrated the coup bid as a false flag to consolidate his powers, set up his opposition for a mass persecution, and push Turkish Armed Forces into a military incursion into Syria.According to the report, it uncovered new evidence from 11 July 2016, four days before the planned coup bid, that a secret plan was circulated among select group of Armed Forces to give an appearance of a coup attempt.The plan was sanctioned by intelligence and military chiefs with the approval of Erdogan.\n\nIn early November 2017, Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for , former Director of the Middle East Program of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, stating that he is an agent of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), that he was present in Istanbul during the 2016 Turkish coup attempt, and that he was one of the key organizers behind the coup attempt.Around 1 December, the Istanbul prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for Graham E. Fuller, an American author and political analyst specializing in Islamic extremism after a long CIA career and holding the role of vice-chair of the United States National Intelligence Council.The prosecutor\'s office based the warrant on suspicion of Fuller helping to plan the coup attempt.Hürriyet stated that Turkish authorities believed that they had traced Fuller\'s location before the attempted coup and afterward when he left Turkey.\n\nBarkey denied his reported role in the coup, describing the claims as ""so ludicrous that they do not even deserve the term \'science fiction\'.""\n\nDeep state in Turkey The Imam\'s Army List of coups and coup attempts since 2010 List of modern conflicts in the Middle East List of attacks on legislatures\n', 'Claim_Context': 'In March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.

113,"{'Wiki_Title': '2016 Turkish coup attempt', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'On 15 July 2016, a faction within the Turkish Armed Forces, organized as the Peace at Home Council, attempted a coup d\'état against state institutions, including the government and president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.They attempted to seize control of several places in Ankara, Istanbul, Marmaris and elsewhere, such as the Asian side entrance of the Bosphorus Bridge, but failed to do so after forces and civilians loyal to the state defeated them.The Council cited an erosion of secularism, elimination of democratic rule, disregard for human rights, and Turkey\'s loss of credibility in the international arena as reasons for the coup.The government said it had evidence the coup leaders were linked to the Gülen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the Republic of Turkey and led by Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish businessman and a well-known Islamic scholar who lives in exile in Pennsylvania.The Turkish government alleged that Gülen was behind the coup (which Gülen denied) and that the United States was harboring him.Events surrounding the coup attempt and the purges in its aftermath reflect a complex power struggle between Islamist elites in Turkey.\n\nDuring the coup attempt, over 300 people were killed and more than 2,100 were injured.Many government buildings, including the Turkish Parliament and the Presidential Palace, were bombed from the air.Mass arrests followed, with at least 40,000 detained, including at least 10,000 soldiers and 2,745 judges, for being affiliated with the coup attempt.15,000 education staff were also suspended and the licenses of 21,000 teachers working at private institutions were revoked after the government stated they were loyal to Gülen.More than 77,000 people have been arrested and over 160,000 fired from their jobs, on reports of connections to Gülen.\n\nThere were many reactions against the coup attempt, both domestically and internationally.The main opposition parties in Turkey condemned the attempt, while several international leaders—such as those of the United States, NATO, the European Union, and neighboring countries—called for ""respect of the democratic institutions in Turkey and its elected officials.""Many international organizations also opposed the coup.The United Nations Security Council, however, did not denounce the coup after disagreements over the phrasing of a statement.Iran opposed the coup and advised Erdogan to defeat the coup plotters.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the head of United States Central Command, General Joseph Votel, was ""siding with coup plotters"", after Votel criticized the Turkish government for arresting the Pentagon\'s contacts in Turkey.\n\nIn March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.The same month, the British Parliament\'s Foreign Affairs Select Committee said some Gulenists were involved in the coup d\'état attempt but found no hard evidence that Fethullah Gülen masterminded the failed coup and found no evidence to justify the United Kingdom designating the Gülen movement as a ""terrorist organization"".\n\nSince the 1970s, followers of the influential cleric Fethullah Gülen had assumed increasingly important positions within the Turkish state apparatus.Gülen several times advised his followers to take key positions in society and government, if necessary with a secret identity to avoid opposition from the laicistic Turkish army and government.Nevertheless, at the start of the 21st century, Gülen\'s followers achieved crucial positions of power in Turkey (and beyond) with a vast network of newspapers, TV channels, schools, associations, lobby organizations, financial institutions and positions within the state such as the army and the judiciary.Initially, the then Prime Minister Erdogan seemingly tolerated the power of the Gülen movement because of common interests such as limiting the undemocratic political power of the military, but also because of impotence and fear of Gülen\'s power within Turkey.\n\nA series of events eventually led to a rift between Erdogan and Gülen.For example, prosecutors that allegedly were aligned with the Gülen movement tried to arrest the intelligence chief Hakan Fidan for the peace negotiations with the PKK, and by extension PM Erdogan subsequently, as the Turkish secret service is directly subordinate to the prime minister of Turkey.During this period (2010-2013), state secrets were leaked, fraud was committed with the entrance exams for government employees (KPSS), a change of power occurred at the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) and (sex)tapes of both government members and opposition members were leaked.Following these events and other incidents, the Turkish government decided to designate the Gülen movement as parallel state and FETÖ (Fethullahist Terror Organization).Alleged Gülen supporters were fired or arrested.The coup attempt that followed is therefore also described by some analysts as a last desperate attempt by Gülenists to retain power.\n\nIt is widely reported that Kemalist ideology played a huge role in motivating the 15 July 2016 coup attempt, like all previous political interventions in the history of Turkey\'s military coups.Since the establishment of multiparty democracy in Turkey in 1946, the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), together with the judiciary, have viewed themselves as guardians of Kemalist ideals and the secular Turkish nationalist state established under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk against political parties that have promoted a larger role for Islam and minorities in public life.The military and judiciary have regularly intervened in politics to block or ban popular parties representing conservative Muslim Turks, attempting to relax the restrictions on traditional religious practices, such as women\'s wearing of headscarves.The military has toppled four elected governments: by coups in 1960 and 1980, and by military decisions in 1971 and 1997.The military has also banned several major political parties.In 1998, Erdoğan, then-mayor of Istanbul, was banned for life from politics and jailed because he had read a religious poem by Ziya Gökalp several years before, at a public meeting.In 2007, the military expressed its opposition to the election of Abdullah Gül, of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), as president, by issuing an e-memorandum.Still, Gül was eventually elected when the AKP won both a referendum on the matter.Also, a snap election, and the party returned with a larger majority in the parliament.The military cited erosion of secularism as one of the reasons for the coup in the statement published on the day of the coup.\n\nAs opposed to previous political interventions by the Turkish military, Turkey\'s AKP government and pro-state media maintain that the 15 July 2016 coup attempt was not motivated by allegiance to Kemalist ideology, but rather to the vast political, economic, and religious network led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen.Between 2007 and 2012, high-profile Kemalists, including high-ranking officers of the Turkish Armed Forces, faced a series of trials and purges, under reports of involvement in a secret society codenamed ""Ergenekon.""Supported by Islamist (both pro-Gülen and pro-Erdoğan) prosecutors, security officials, and media, the purges allowed lower-rank Islamist officers to assume high-ranking military positions.They were seen as a bid by Turkey\'s civilian leaders under President Erdoğan to establish dominance over the military.In these trials in 2013 – viewed as ""sensational"" and ""one of the biggest in recent Turkish history"" – 275 people, including senior military officers, journalists, lawyers, and academics, were said to be involved in the so-called ""Ergenekon"" conspiracy, reportedly plotting a coup in 2003/04 against then–Prime Minister Erdoğan.Additionally, some military officers were said to be involved in a separate reported plot, Sledgehammer.Simultaneously, Erdoğan promoted lower-ranking officers up the chain of command, ensuring that the military chief of staff was loyal to him and thereby demoralizing the army.\n\nThe AKP\'s alliance with Gülen started to collapse during 2013 as Gülenists targeted the AKP using corruption charges.After the split, Erdoğan decided it would be advantageous to rehabilitate the army.The ""Ergenekon"" convictions were overturned in April 2016 by the Court of Cassation, which ruled that the existence of the network was unproven.\n\nIn 2013, law enforcement efforts to fight corruption, which had led to the 2013 corruption scandal in Turkey, were faulted by Erdoğan.The anti-corruption efforts were a source of tension between the Gülenists and the AKP.In political analysis in the months prior to the coup attempt, the incidence of corruption was reported to be ""rife"" in Turkey.Following the coup attempt, some coup leaders cited corruption as a reason for their actions.\n\nOn 13 July, less than two days before the coup was launched, Erdoğan signed a bill giving Turkish soldiers immunity from prosecution while taking part in domestic operations.The bill requires cases against commanders to be approved by the prime minister, while district governors may sign cases against lower-ranking soldiers.The immunity bill was seen as part of the détente between the government and the armed forces.The latter has increasingly been taking over military operations in Kurdish-inhabited areas from police and paramilitary units.\n\nOn 15 July 2016, as reported just before 23:00 EEST (UTC+3), military jets were spotted flying over Ankara, and both the Fatih Sultan Mehmet and Bosphorus bridges in Istanbul were closed.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said military action was being ""taken outside the chain of command"" and it was an ""illegal attempt"" to seize power by ""part of the military"".He further said that those involved ""will pay the highest price.""Local media also reported tanks in Istanbul\'s Atatürk Airport.It was reported that Internet users within Turkey were blocked from accessing Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.Twitter later stated that it had ""no reason to think we\'ve been fully blocked"".Some hostages were taken at military headquarters, including the Turkish Chief of the General Staff Hulusi Akar.At around 21:00, the coupists had invited Salih Zeki Çolak, the commander of the Turkish Land Forces to the military headquarters.When he arrived, he was immediately apprehended.Abidin Ünal, head of the Turkish Air Force, who had been attending a wedding in Istanbul, was abducted from there by soldiers who descended from a helicopter.The coupists then tried to force Akar to sign the coup declaration, almost strangling him using a belt in the process.He refused and was then taken to the Akıncı Air Base and other commanders at the headquarters.The military also entered the Justice and Development Party\'s offices in Istanbul and asked people to leave.\n\nEarly reports said President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was safe in Marmaris, south-west Turkey, where he had been on holiday.\n\nFrom around 23:00 to midnight, helicopters bombed the police special forces headquarters and police air force headquarters in Gölbaşı, just outside of Ankara.The attacks left 42 dead and 43 injured.Türksat headquarters in Gölbaşı was also attacked, killing two security personnel.\n\nAt around 23:50, soldiers occupied Taksim Square in central Istanbul.\n\nAt 00:02, it was reported by Reuters that soldiers were inside the buildings of the state broadcaster, the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), in Ankara.During the coup attempt, soldiers forced anchor Tijen Karaş to read out a statement saying that ""the democratic and secular rule of law has been eroded by the current government"" and that Turkey was now led by the Peace at Home Council who would ""ensure the safety of the population.""The statement read in part: ""Turkish Armed Forces have completely taken over the administration of the country to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedoms, the rule of law and general security that was damaged.[...] All international agreements are still valid.We hope that all of our good relationships with all countries will continue.""The plotters said they had ""done so to preserve democratic order, and that the rule of law must remain a priority"".The statement also ordered temporary martial law (sıkıyönetim), and said a new constitution would be prepared ""as soon as possible"".TRT was then taken off air.\n\nOther media outlets were also raided by the putschists, such as Turkish newspaper Hürriyet and private broadcaster CNN Türk.\n\nReuters reported on 15 July that an EU source described the coup as ""well orchestrated,"" and predicted that ""given the scale of the operation, it is difficult to imagine they will stop short of prevailing.""Another EU diplomat said that the Turkish ambassador in his capital was shocked and ""taking it very seriously"".\n\nThe Peace at Home Council was reportedly chaired by Muharrem Köse.\n\nAdana: Upon receiving the intelligence that thirty soldiers from the 10th Air Base Command would move to the base where the regional and provincial gendarmerie commands were located, the police prevented the soldiers from leaving the guardhouse with TOMA and armored vehicles and blocked them.Bitlis: In the Tatvan district of Bitlis, on the orders of Brigade Commander Arif Seddar Afşar, helicopters were circulated in the skies of Tatvan and fired at the city.The brigade command left the municipality\'s construction equipment in front of the barracks in case there was a tank operation in the district.Denizli: Approximately five hundred officers and non-commissioned officers who participated in the coup attempt surrendered to the gendarmerie and police forces.They were interrogated at Çardak District Gendarme Command.Kars: With the order of Kars 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, the soldiers who came with tanks and armored personnel carriers surrounded the Police Headquarters building and wanted to detain Faruk Karaduman, the chief of police.At the same hours, the invitation of Deputy Governors, 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, went to the command.Kocaeli: Turkcell\'s data center in Gebze was raided by soldiers who participated in the coup attempt.Soldiers who tried to interrupt the internet service were detained.Malatya: A rebellious soldier opened fire inside a base of the Turkish 2nd Army, damaging six vehicles.The base was besieged by police and loyal soldiers, and the shooter was captured.Marmaris: Three military helicopters carried out a bomb attack on the hotel where Erdoğan was staying.Forty rebellious soldiers of the Special Forces Command clashed with the police in the region.Mersin: Mersin Garrison and Mediterranean Region Commander Admiral Nejat Atilla Demirhan called Mersin Provincial Police Deputy Chief Yakup Usta and Gendarmerie Colonel Mustafa Bakçepınar and stated that the Turkish Armed Forces had taken over the administration.He introduced himself as the martial law garrison commander and ordered Mersin Governor Özdemir Çakacak and district governors to be taken into custody.Demirhan and Dağdelen, who made the same announcement with the police radio obtained from Mersin Police Department, were detained through the operation of the security forces.Sakarya: Sakarya Governorship was captured with armored personnel carriers, military trucks and many military jeeps from the military unit in the Kandıra district of Kocaeli.As a reinforcement, two military vehicles full of soldiers from the Sakarya central division command had to return to their barracks in the face of the resistance of the police and the harsh reaction of the people who took to the streets against the putschists.The vehicles occupying the Sakarya Governorate were seized by the citizens and the soldiers in them were neutralized and handed over to the security forces.Afterwards, citizens and security forces entered the governor\'s office and neutralized the soldiers there and suppressed the uprising in the province.Eight civilian citizens were injured as a result of the fire opened by the military during the incident.Şırnak: Çakırsöğüt Gendarmerie Commando Brigadier General Ali Osman Gürcan and 309 soldiers, that participated in the coup attempt, were detained by the security forces.\n\nTurkey\'s Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım responded to the events by stating that an ""illegal action is taking place outside of the chain of command"".He also said that ""the government elected by the people remains in charge and this government will only go when the people say so.""The Turkish Presidential office said President Erdoğan was on holiday inside Turkey and condemned the coup attempt as an attack on democracy.A presidential source also said Erdoğan and his government were still in power.The first messages from Erdoğan were transmitted at around 00:23At about 01:00, Erdoğan did a FaceTime interview with CNN Türk, in which he called upon his supporters to take to the streets in defiance of the military-imposed curfew, saying ""There is no power higher than the power of the people.Let them do what they will at the public squares and airports.""Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş appeared on live television, saying Turkey\'s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is still in charge of the government.The mayor of Ankara, Melih Gökçek of the AKP, encouraged people to go out to the city\'s streets in defiance, despite a curfew imposed by the military.Erdoğan\'s plane took off from Dalaman Airport near Marmaris at 23:47, but had to wait in the air south of Atatürk for the airport to be secured.His plane landed at 02:50\n\nThe First Army General Command in Istanbul stated in a news conference that the TSK did not support the coup and the perpetrators represented a tiny faction that were on the verge of being brought under control.Istanbul Atatürk Airport was closed; all flights from the airport were cancelled.There was an explosion in the TRT broadcasting headquarters and gunfire was reported in Ankara.Soon after, it was stormed by a crowd of civilians and police, with four soldiers inside reportedly being ""neutralized"".The channel went back on air and Karaş, who had previously announced the coup, said live that she had been held hostage and forced to read the declaration of the coup at gunpoint.\n\nBy 01:00, it was reported that the military had pulled its forces from the Atatürk airport and people were coming inside, but by 01:13, it was reported that tanks were inside the airport and gunfire was heard.\n\nTanks opened fire near the Turkish Parliament Building.The parliamentary building was also hit from the air.Injuries were reported among protesters following gunfire on Bosphorus Bridge.\n\nA helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was shot down by a Turkish military F-16 fighter jet.There were also reports of pro-state jets flying over Ankara to ""neutralize"" helicopters used by those behind the coup.\n\nAt 03:08, a military helicopter opened fire on the Turkish parliament.At 03:10, Turkish Armed Forces stated on their website that they had complete control over the country.At 03:12, Yıldırım made a statement saying that the situation was under control and that a no-fly zone was declared over Ankara and that military planes that still flew would be shot down.\n\nIt was reported that the Turkish parliament had been bombed again at 03:23 and 03:33.A helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was also seen flying by it.Half an hour following the report of 12 deaths and 2 injuries in the parliament, soldiers entered CNN Türk\'s headquarters and forced the studio to go off air.After an hour of interruption by the pro-coup soldiers, CNN Türk resumed its broadcast.Later, İsmail Kahraman said a bomb exploded at a corner of the public relations building inside the parliament, with no deaths but several injuries among police officers.\n\nAt around 04:00 two or three helicopters attacked Erdogan\'s hotel.According to eyewitness accounts, ten to fifteen heavily armed men landed and started firing.In the ensuing conflict, two policemen were killed and 8 were injured.\n\nThe Doğan News Agency reported that in Istanbul several individuals were injured after soldiers fired on a group of people attempting to cross the Bosphorus Bridge in protest of the attempted coup.\n\nOn Saturday 16 July 2016, at 00:42 EEST (UTC+3), a Turkish Black Hawk helicopter sent a distress signal and requested permission from Greek authorities for an emergency landing, and landed eight minutes later (00:50) at the Dimokritos airport in Alexandroupoli, in Greece, while two Greek F-16s observed the procedure and escorted it to the airport.The first reports said that the passengers were seven military personnel and a civilian.Later, it turned out that all were military personnel (two majors, four captains and two non-commissioned officers).They had removed the badges and insignia from their uniforms, making it impossible to know their rank.All were arrested after landing for illegal entry into the country.They were transferred to the local police station, while the Greek authorities at the airport guarded the helicopter.The eight passengers all requested political asylum in Greece as they believed they would not get a fair trial in Turkey.On 21 September 2016, Greece denied three out of the eight asylum.The men\'s lawyer Stavroula Tomara said they would be appealing the decision and said they had the ""impression that the decision has been predetermined, and that the interview was conducted just as a formality.""On 11 October 2016, four more of the eight were denied asylum.Two of the men who had previously been denied asylum applied for a re-evaluation but their applications were also rejected.\n\nAfter Erdoğan flew into Istanbul, he made a televised speech inside the airport at around 04:00, whilst thousands gathered outside.He addressed a crowd of supporters in the airport, at about 06:30 He said, ""In Turkey, armed forces are not governing the state or leading the state.They cannot.""He blamed ""those in Pennsylvania"" (a reference to Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, and his Hizmet Movement) for the coup attempt.Erdoğan also said he had plans to ""clean up"" the army, saying that ""This uprising is a gift from God to us.""State-run Anadolu Agency named former Colonel Muharrem Köse, who in March 2016 was dishonorably discharged for reported association with Gülen, as the suspected leader of the coup.However, the Alliance for Shared Values, a non-profit organization associated with Gülen, released a statement reiterating that it condemns any military intervention in domestic politics, and saying Erdoğan\'s allegations against the movement were ""highly irresponsible"".Gülen himself said in a brief statement just before midnight: ""As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nReuters reported that in early hours of 16 July, the coup appeared to have ""crumbled"" as crowds defied pro-coup military orders and gathered in major squares of Istanbul and Ankara to oppose it.Reuters also reported pro-coup soldiers surrendering to the police in Taksim Square, Istanbul.It was reported that by 05:18, Atatürk airport had completely been recaptured by the government whilst the police had surrounded the coupists inside the Turkish army headquarters, calling for them to surrender.Between 06:00–08:00 a skirmish took place there.In Akar\'s absence, Ümit Dündar, head of the First Army, was appointed Acting Chief of Staff.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning of 16 July, soldiers blocking the Bosphorus Bridge surrendered to the police.According to the government-run Anadolu Agency, this consisted of a group of 50 soldiers.Some of these soldiers were lynched by civilians despite the police\'s efforts, who fired into the air to protect the surrendering soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile, in the headquarters of the Turkish Army, 700 unarmed soldiers surrendered as the police conducted an operation into the building while 150 armed soldiers were kept inside by the police.The coupists in the TRT building in Istanbul surrendered in the early morning as well.Chief of Staff Akar, held hostage at the Akıncı Air Base in Ankara, was also rescued by pro-state forces.\n\nOne of the primary reasons that the coup failed was chaos among the plotters\' ranks.Turkey\'s National Intelligence Organization (MİT) head Hakan Fidan discovered the coup plot, and the plotters were forced to execute the coup five hours ahead of schedule.One of the main organizers, General Semih Terzi, was shot dead by loyalist Sgt.Maj.Ömer Halisdemir at the onset, demoralizing and disrupting command and control of the rebels.These two incidents resulted in the coup being carried out in an uncoordinated manner.The highest ranking staff officers opposed the coup, and publicly ordered all personnel to return to their barracks.Acting outside the military chain of command, the rebels lacked the coordination and resources to achieve their goals.The conscripted soldiers that the rebels mobilized were uninformed of their mission\'s true purpose and became demoralized.Many surrendered rather than shoot demonstrators.The commander of the First Army in Istanbul, General Ümit Dündar, personally called Erdoğan to warn him of the plot, persuading him to evacuate his hotel ahead of the plotters, and helped to secure Istanbul for Erdoğan to land.The MİT also mobilized its anti-aircraft guns, which the plotters were unaware existed, deterring rebel jets and commando teams.\n\nEqually important to the coup\'s failure, according to military strategist Edward N. Luttwak, was the inability of the rebels to neutralize Erdoğan and other high ranking government officials, either by killing or detaining them.A unit of special forces was sent via helicopter to kill or capture the president, but missed because he had been evacuated by his security detail just minutes before.Once Erdoğan landed at Atatürk International Airport (which had been recaptured from the rebels by his supporters), It became highly unlikely that the coup attempt would succeed.According to a military source, several rebel F-16s targeted Erdoğan\'s presidential jet en route to Istanbul, but they did not fire.A senior Turkish counter-terrorism official later stated that the jets did not fire because the fighter jet pilots were told by President Erdoğan\'s pilot over the radio that the (flight of the) Gulfstream IV was a Turkish Airlines flight.\n\nAccording to Naunihal Singh, author of Seizing Power, the coup attempt also failed because the plotters failed to secure control of the media and shape the narrative.Successful coups require that the rebels control the mass media.This allows even small rebel contingents to portray themselves as fully in control, and their victory as inevitable.Consequently, they convince the public, along with neutral and even loyalist soldiers, to defect to them or not resist.The rebels failed to properly broadcast their messages effectively across the media that they controlled.They failed to capture Türksat, Turkey\'s main cable and satellite communications company, and failed to gain control of the country\'s television and mobile phone networks.This allowed Erdoğan to make his Facetime call, and to speak on television.\n\nOther scholars of civil-military relations, like Drew H. Kinney, have said reports like Luttwak and Singh\'s miss the point of their own analysis: civil resistance thwarted the coup.Luttwak argues that wayward elements of the Turkish armed forces could not silence Erdoğan.Singh says that the rebels could not project success because they couldn\'t control the message.Kinney states that neither of these reasons on their own matter, but rather it\'s their effect—civil disobedience—that is important.We might find that ""[Gülen\'s movement] ...[might] have had nothing to do with the attempted takeover in July, but civilians [nevertheless] definitely played a role in thwarting the coup,"" writes Kinney.""...[A]n unhappy civilian populace mobilized to face down the military.""\n\nErdoğan wasn\'t censored (Luttwak\'s point) and was therefore able to use FaceTime to mobilize resistance, which in turn hindered the conspirators\' ability to project success (Singh\'s point).The result is civilian resistance to soldiers, i.e., people power.The reason Singh, Luttwak, and other scholars of civil-military relations miss this is, according to Kinney, because they ""usually do not study extra-military reasons for coup failures/successes,"" but rather put a premium on ""the inner-workings of the [military] operation.""In short, they blame the military for its failure rather than acknowledge the power of the masses and their successes.\n\nPro-state forces sent text messages to every Turkish citizen calling for them to protest against the coup attempt.Throughout the night sela prayers were repeatedly called from mosque minarets across the country to encourage people to resist the coup plotters.While the sela is usually called from minarets to inform the public of a funeral, they are also traditionally performed to notify of a significant event, in this case ""to rally people"".\n\nThe coup plotters initiated their operation hours ahead of the planned time when they understood that their plans had been compromised.Had the coup been launched at its original time, the middle of the night, much of the population would have been asleep.The streets would have been mostly empty.\n\nReports have emerged, neither confirmed nor denied by Russia or Turkey that the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate intercepted signals on an imminent coup passed on to loyal Turkish operatives.The intercepted plans revealed several helicopters with commandos were on the way to Marmaris\'s coastal resort, where Erdoğan stayed, capturing or killing him.Pre-warned, Erdoğan left quickly to avoid them.\n\nAn extensive purge of the Turkish civil service began in the wake of the coup attempt, with President Erdoğan warning his opponents that ""they will pay a heavy price for this.""The New York Times along with some other Western media such as The Economist, described the purges as a ""counter-coup"", with the Times expecting the president to ""become more vengeful and obsessed with control than ever, exploiting the crisis not just to punish mutinous soldiers but to further quash whatever dissent is left in Turkey,"".As of 20 July 2016, the purge already had seen over 45,000 military officials, police officers, judges, governors and civil servants arrested or suspended, including 2,700 judges, 15,000 teachers, and every university dean in the country.\n\n163 generals and admirals were detained, around 45% of the Turkish military\'s total.\n\nOn 18 July 2016, United States State Secretary John Kerry urged Turkish authorities to halt the increasing crackdown on its citizens, indicating that the crackdown was meant to ""suppress dissent.""French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault voiced concern, warning against a ""political system which turns away from democracy"" in response to the purges.\n\nOn 17 August 2016, Turkey started releasing what was expected to eventually amount to about 38,000 prison inmates, to make more space in the penal system for detainees, numbering about 35,000, who were arrested or detained after being involved in or suspected of association, with the 2016 failed coup.\n\nOn 28 September 2016, Turkish justice minister Bekir Bozdağ said 70,000 people had been processed and 32,000 were formally arrested.\n\nMajor General Cahit Bakir, who commanded Turkish forces under NATO in Afghanistan, and Brigadier General Sener Topuc, responsible for education and aid in Afghanistan, were detained by authorities in Dubai connected with the failed coup.\n\nGeneral Akın Öztürk, former Commander of the Turkish Air Force, was the Turkish military attaché to Israel.He was arrested on charges of having played a leading role in the failed coup.Öztürk has denied the charges.\n\nGeneral Adem Huduti, the commander of the Second Army, positioned along the southern borders with Syria and Iraq, and General Erdal Öztürk, the commander of the 3rd Corps, were also arrested.\n\nRear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been stationed at NATO\'s Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk, Virginia, sought asylum in the United States after being recalled by the Turkish government.\n\nIn July 2018, Istanbul\'s 25th Criminal Court sentenced 72 former soldiers involved in the coup attempt to life in prison.\n\nOn 20 June 2019, a terrorism court in Turkey sentenced 151 people to life in prison, including General Akın Öztürk, former commander of Turkish Air Force and the most senior officer involved in the coup.128 people received ""aggravated life"" sentences, which indicates harsh conditions without parole, for their role in the coup, with another 23 receiving standard life sentences.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom President Erdoğan said as one of the principal conspirators, condemned the coup attempt and denied any role in it.""I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey,"" he said in an emailed statement reported by The New York Times.""Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force.I pray to God for Turkey, Turkish citizens, and all those currently in Turkey that this situation is resolved peacefully and quickly.As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nPresident Erdoğan asked the United States to extradite Gülen: ""I call on you again, after there was a coup attempt.Extradite this man in Pennsylvania to Turkey!If we are strategic partners or model partners, do what is necessary.""Prime Minister Yildirim has threatened war against any country that would support Gülen.Turkish Labor Minister Süleyman Soylu said that ""America is behind the coup.""\n\nRegarding the AKP\'s statement against Gülen, Secretary of State Kerry invited the Turkish government ""to present us with any legitimate evidence that withstands scrutiny,"" before they would accept an extradition request.\n\nOn 15 August 2016, former United States diplomat James Jeffrey, who was the United States ambassador to Turkey from 2008 until 2010 made the following remarks: ""The Gülen movement has some infiltration at the least in the military that I am aware of.They of course had extreme infiltration into the police and judiciary earlier.I saw that when I was in Turkey previously, particularly in the Sledgehammer case, Hakan Fidan case, and the corruption cases in 2013.Obviously, significant segment of Turkey\'s bureaucracy was infiltrated and had their allegiance to a movement.That of course is absolutely unacceptable and extremely dangerous.It likely led to the coup attempt.""\n\nOutside Turkey, in Beringen, Belgium, anti-coup protesters attempted to attack a building owned by the pro-Gülen movement group \'Vuslat\'.The police brought in a water cannon to keep the attackers at bay.In news articles it was stated that the police also protected the houses of Gülen supporters.People advocated on social media to go to Beringen once more, and there was unrest in Heusden-Zolder, elsewhere in Belgium.Furthermore, in Somalia the government ordered ""the total closure of all activities"" of an organization linked to the Gülen movement, and gave its staff seven days to leave the country.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, President Erdoğan said Western countries were ""supporting terrorism"" and the military coup, saying ""I\'m calling on the United States: what kind of strategic partners are we, that you can still host someone whose extradition I have asked for?""\n\nOn 31 January 2017, British Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, Alan Duncan said he believed the Gülen movement was responsible for the coup attempt.Duncan went on saying ""the organization which incorporated itself into the state tried to topple the democratic structure in Turkey"".\n\nIn a speech on 29 July 2016, President Erdoğan said U.S. Central Command chief Joseph Votel was ""siding with coup plotters""; Erdoğan said the United States was protecting Fethullah Gülen, whom the Turkish government blames for the coup attempt.Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim made similar comments.In response, Votel said that the Turkish government\'s statements were ""unfortunate and completely inaccurate"" and expressed concern that the mass arrests and firings of military officers would damage military cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey.Similarly, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said that the Turkish military purges were impairing the fight against ISIS.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, in an escalation of tensions with the United States, Erdoğan questioned Turkey\'s relationship with the United States and criticized the West, saying that ""script"" for the abortive putsch last month was ""written abroad"".Erdoğan stated that he had personally asked Obama to extradite Gülen to Turkey.When the U.S. government replied it would need evidence of the cleric\'s guilt before extradition, to which Erdoğan said: ""When you asked for the return of a terrorist, we did not ask for documentation. ...Let us put him on trial.""\n\nYeni Şafak daily, a Turkish pro-state newspaper, stated that the former commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, now-retired United States Army General John F. Campbell, was the ""mastermind"" behind the coup attempt in Turkey.Campbell called the statement ""absolutely ridiculous"" and President Obama said ""Any reports that we had any previous knowledge of a coup attempt, that there was any U.S. involvement in it, that we were anything other than entirely supportive of Turkish democracy are completely false, unequivocally false.""\n\nOn 1 December 2017, Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for American political analyst, former CIA official and former vice chairman of US National Intelligence Council Graham Fuller, stating his involvement in the coup.A career US State Department official who was once CIA Station Chief in Kabul and later went on to be a political scientist in Rand Corporation specializing in the Middle East, Turkish authorities said Fuller attended a meeting in Istanbul on 15 July 2016 involving organization and coordination of the botched coup.Another American among the attendance, as stated by the Turkish prosecutors, was academic Henri Barkey who was named a suspect a week after the failed coup.\n\nThe U.S. consulate in Turkey issued an advisory to U.S. citizens to avoid the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey, which houses about 50 nuclear bombs, until ""normal operations have been restored"".They stated that local authorities were denying access to the air base and that power supplying the air base was shut off.\n\nThe Incirlik base is important to the U.S.-led effort in Syria to combat ISIL and other militants.Nearly 1,500 American personnel are housed in the base.\n\nTwenty-four hours after initial reports that the air base was shut down, United States defense department officials confirmed that the base and its airspace had re-opened to military aircraft and that operations by American aircraft will resume.The Turkish commander of the air base, brig.Gen. Bekir Ercan Van was arrested.After the failure of the coup Gen Bekir Ercan Van sought asylum from the U.S., but his request was denied by U.S.\n\nFollowing the failed coup attempt multiple media outlets have published editorials advocating the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Incirlik Air base as Turkey is unstable.\n\nOn 16 July, anti-coup protesters chanted against locals in areas of Istanbul with high concentration of Alevis, including Okmeydanı and Gazi.Such incidents also occurred in a quarter of Antakya with a high Alevi population, where a motorcyclist stating to be a sharia advocate was lynched.In a neighbourhood of Ankara, shops belonging to Syrians were attacked by a mob.In Malatya, Sunni Islamists harassed residents of an Alevi neighbourhood, particularly the women, and attempted to enter the neighbourhood en masse.Police intervened and blocked all roads leading there.In Kadıköy, people drinking alcohol in public were attacked by a group of religious fundamentalists.\n\nFollowing the arrests, thousands of anti-coup protesters demanded instituting the death penalty against detainees connected with the coup, chanting ""we want the death penalty"".President Erdoğan has been open to reinstituting the death penalty, noting that ""in a democracy, whatever the people want they will get.""Turkish authorities have not executed anyone since 1984, but legally abolished capital punishment only in 2004 as a pre-condition to join the European Union.\n\nEuropean Union officials have been vocal about their opposition to purges by Turkish authorities in connection to the coup.French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that Turkey must work within the framework of the law to uphold Europe\'s democratic principles.Furthermore, on 18 July 2016, Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of Foreign Affairs of the European Union, announced that no country will be admitted into the European Union ""if it introduces the death penalty"".Moreover, German press secretary, Steffen Seibert, stated that reinstituting the death penalty will end Turkey\'s accession talks with the European Union.\n\nTurkey is a member of the Council of Europe, and ratified the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) as part of its terms of membership.The ECHR is an international treaty that includes the abolition of the death penalty among its terms.As such, Turkey is legally bound not to reintroduce the death penalty.\n\nOn 20 July 2016, President Erdoğan announced a three-month state of emergency in response to the attempted coup, invoking Article 120 of the Constitution of Turkey (""Declaration of state of emergency because of widespread acts of violence and serious deterioration of public order"").Under the state of emergency, under Article 121, ""the Council of Ministers, meeting under the chairpersonship of the President of the Republic, may issue decrees having the force of law on matters necessitated by the state of emergency"", with decrees subject to subsequent parliamentary approval.The state of emergency was endorsed by the Parliament on 21 July by 346 votes to 115.The Justice and Development Party and the Nationalist Movement Party supported the state of emergency, whilst the Republican People\'s Party and the Peoples\' Democratic Party opposed it.Prime Minister Yıldırım said at the Parliament that the state of emergency was necessary to ""get rid of this scourge rapidly"".\n\nAs part of the state of emergency, deputy prime minister Kurtulmuş announced that Turkey was temporarily suspending part of the European Convention on Human Rights following the attempted coup, invoking Article 15 of the Convention (""war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation"").The suspensions must be notified to the Council of Europe and may not affect the right to a fair trial or the prohibition on torture.\n\nThis state of emergency in Turkey as well as the hindrance of the right to protest that occurred within such framework have been layered onto a longer history of emergency rules, oppressive legislation and daily government practice that have reinforced both.We can see from this the ""autocratisation"" process in Turkey has thrived of existing legal framework deeply associated in legacies of past ""emergencies"".\n\nOn 3 October 2016 Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş declared the governments intention to extend the state of emergency by a further three months raising objections from both the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) and Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) were critical of the governments use of their emergency powers and declared that they would vote against an extension.\n\nFollowing the National Security Council\'s recommendation for the extension President Erdoğan stated that it was possible that the state of emergency could last for longer than a year prompting outcry from the opposition, Leader of the Main Opposition Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu said that ""The president saying that the state of emergency can last longer than 12 months is strengthening the fear of a counter-coup"" and that it was ""raising the prospect of opportunist measures.""\n\nThe AKP\'s governmental majority allowed the three-month extension to take effect on 19 October 2016.The two-year-long state of emergency was ended on 19 July 2018.\n\nOn 16 July 2016, the media reported that eight Turkish military personnel of various ranks had landed in Greece\'s northeastern city of Alexandroupolis on board a Black Hawk helicopter and claimed political asylum in Greece.While the Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu demanded extradition of ""the eight traitors as soon as possible"", the Greek authorities stated: ""We will follow the procedures of international law.However, we give severe considerations to the fact that [the Turkish military men] are accused, in their own country, of violating the constitutional order and trying to overthrow democracy.""The helicopter was returned to Turkey shortly thereafter.The eight asylum seekers, their asylum case pending, were later transferred to Athens, mainly for safety reasons.On 26 January, the Supreme Court of Greece eventually ruled against their extradition, on the grounds that the eight were unlikely to face a fair trial if returned to their home country and due to concerns over their safety.\n\nOn 15 February 2017, five Turkish commandos illegally entered Greece through the Evros river.However, once they entered the country, the group split.The two of them surrendered to the police and on 20 February 2017, requested political asylum.They were being held in the city of Alexandroupolis.The two men belonged to the Turkish navy.The names given by the two reportedly match the names of two fugitives wanted in relation to the shadowy operation against Erdoğan himself.The Greek government mentioned that the Greek authorities will not allow the country to be dragged into the ongoing feud between the Turkish state and the followers of Gulen.But there were no sign of the other three.According to a lawyer there were indications that the other three have been arrested by Greek authorities who were about to expel them to Turkey.According to new evidence and new information these three ""arrested"" marines were delivered under fast and informal procedures from Greek to Turkish services.\n\nAfter the coup attempt, two Turkish military attachés in Athens, Staff Col. İlhan Yaşıtlı and naval attaché Col. Halis Tunç, had reportedly disappeared along with their families.The Greek foreign ministry canceled the two attachés\' accreditations on 7 August 2016, upon the request of the Turkish foreign ministry.Greek media reported that they might have fled to Italy.On 11 August 2016, the Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu confirmed the reports saying that they had left Greece for Italy on 6 August and adding that Turkey would officially ask the Italian authorities to extradite the two soldiers.\n\nOn 9 August 2016, the media reported that Turkey\'s Rear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been on a United States-based assignment for NATO and after the coup was subject to a detention order in Turkey, had sought asylum in the United States.\n\nIn mid-November 2016, it was officially confirmed that about 40 Turkish military servicemen of various ranks stationed at NATO command structures had applied for asylum in Germany and Belgium.\n\nIn January 2017, Der Spiegel magazine and ARD broadcaster reported that about 40 mostly high-ranking Turkish soldiers who worked at NATO facilities in Germany requested asylum in Germany.\n\nAt the end of February 2017, Germany said it had received 136 asylum requests from Turks holding diplomatic passports since the July coup attempt.The figure was a total for August 2016 to January 2017; some were presumed to be military officers posted to NATO bases in Germany.\n\nIn November 2016, NATO\'s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that Turkish NATO Officers had requested asylum in the countries where they had been posted.He did not name the nations involved or the number of officers, saying it was a matter for those countries to decide.He said: ""Some Turkish officers working in NATO command structure ... have requested asylum in the countries where they are working. ...As always, this is an issue that is going to be assessed and decided by the different NATO allies as a national issue.""\n\nAs of March 2017, Norway have granted asylum for four Turkish soldiers and a military attache.\n\nSeveral Turkish citizens with diplomatic passports have sought political asylum in Switzerland.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, detainees in Turkey have been denied access to legal counsel, have been beaten and tortured.They have not been provided with adequate food, water, or medical care.At least one has attempted suicide.Amnesty International wanted the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture to send people to check on detainees conditions.A person who had been on duty at the Ankara police headquarters said that police denied medical treatment to a detainee.""Let him die.We will say he came to us dead,"" the witness quoted a police doctor as saying.\n\nAlso, Erdoğan has extended the maximum period of detention for suspects from four days to 30, a move Amnesty said increased the risk of torture or other maltreatment of detainees.\n\nTurkish Justice Ministry denied the reports and the Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said on his Twitter account: ""There has not been any torture or assault of detainees in custody,"" in response to reports by Amnesty International.""The claims of torture and assault make up a pre-packaged misinformation campaign formed by members of FETÖ, one which is untrue and distorted,""\n\nOn 7 August, between three and five million people gathered for an anti-coup rally organized by the Turkish authorities in Istanbul.President Erdoğan and the two leaders of the major opposition parties (the Republican People\'s Party and the Nationalist Movement Party) were present.\n\nGreek authorities on several Aegean islands have called for emergency measures to curtail a growing flow of refugees from Turkey; the number of migrants and refugees willing to make the journey across the Aegean has increased noticeably after the failed coup.At Athens officials voiced worries because Turkish monitors overseeing the deal in Greece had been abruptly pulled out after the failed coup without being replaced.Also, the mayor of Kos expressed concern in a letter to the Greek Prime Minister citing the growing influx of refugees and migrants after the failed coup.The Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises (SETE) warned about the prospect of another flare-up in the refugee/migrant crisis due to the Turkish political instability.\n\nVincent Cochetel, the director of the Europe Bureau of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in August 2016 that parts of the EU-Turkey deal about immigration were already de facto suspended because no Turkish police were present at Greek detention centres to oversee deportations.\n\nOn 25 August 2016, seven Turkish citizens sought asylum in Greece.Two were university professors, and their two children applied for asylum in Alexandroupoli after they illegally entered the country from the northeastern border.Also, three businessmen illegally reached the Greek island of Rhodes, and they also applied for asylum.\n\nOn 30 August 2016, a Turkish judge arrived at the Greek island of Chios on a migrant boat, with six Syrian nationals, and sought asylum in the country.He told the Greek coastguard and police officers that he is being persecuted in Turkey for his political beliefs by President Tayyip Erdoğan.The Turkish judge had been arrested for illegally entering the country and was transferred to Athens for his asylum proceedings.The Syrian nationals claimed refugee status.\n\nOn 11 September 2016, four Turkish civilians were arrested by Turkish police.An academic and a teacher attempted to escape to Greece illegally by crossing the Evros river, and the other two because they organized the escape attempt.The academic and the teacher paid a total of 12,500 euros in Istanbul to arrange their escape to Greece.Before their attempt, both the academic and the teacher were suspended from their duties as part of the ongoing probe into the failed coup attempt.Police also seized an air raft, an oar and a pump while detaining the suspects.The court later ordered the two\'s release while the other two suspects, who organized the escape attempt, were arrested.\n\nOn 21 September 2016, ten Turkish civilians, two men, two women and six children landed by boat illegally on the Greek island of Rhodes and sought asylum.They told the Greek authorities they were working in the private sector in Turkey and the Turkish government was persecuting them due to their political beliefs.\n\nOn 29 September 2016, five Turkish nationals, a couple and their child and two other men, arrived in Greece, at Alexandroupolis by crossing the Evros River by boat illegally and requested political asylum.\n\nOn 12 December 2016, one female Turkish national, landed by boat, full of refugees and immigrants, illegally on the Greek island of Lesbos.She requested political asylum.\n\nOn 24 October 2017, Turkish authorities obtained information that 995 Turks have applied for asylum in Greece after the coup attempt.\n\nMore than 1,800 Turkish citizens requested asylum in Greece in 2017.\n\nOn 18 February 2018, seventeen Turkish nationals, including six children, requested asylum in Greece at Oinousses island.\n\nIn August 2018, the former lawmaker for the Peoples\' Democratic Party, Leyla Birlik, requested asylum in Greece after illegally crossing the border near Alexandroupolis.\n\nBerlin mayor, Michael Müller (SPD), said Turkey was waging war on supporters of the Gülen movement in Germany.He said that Turkish officials had approached him and asked him whether he would be prepared to confront the Gülen movement in Berlin critically and, if necessary, to support measures against it.The mayor rejected the idea and made it very clear that Turkish conflicts could not be waged in the city.\n\nDer Spiegel presented classified documents, which showed that Turkey\'s secret service (MIT) had asked Germany\'s foreign intelligence agency (BND) for help in rounding up Gülen supporters in Germany.The Turkish secret service wanted the BND to use its influence to spur German lawmakers into taking action against Gülen supporters and extraditing them to Turkey.Also, Turkey\'s government has sent German authorities requests for searches and extraditions linked to supporters of Fethullah Gülen in Germany.\n\nIn Germany businesses thought to be in support of the Gülen movement have been harassed by Erdoğan supporters.\n\nAfter the failed coup, there was a massive demonstration in Cologne at Germany, in late July, in support of Turkish President Erdoğan.Erdoğan wanted to address the participants via video but was rejected by the local authorities and the German Constitutional Court due to security concerns.Turkey said that the ban was unacceptable and a violation of freedom of expression.\n\nGerman authorities said Turkish mosques in Germany were playing Turkish politics and worried that Turkey\'s internal politics spilled over into German cities.For years, German authorities had encouraged Turkey\'s state-run religious institution Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs usually referred to as DİTİB to provide Islamic preachers and teachers and Gülen Movement Schools for the large Turkish diaspora in Germany.DİTİB manages some 900 mosques in Germany.Gülen movement runs 100 educational facilities in Germany.\n\nAfter the failed coup DİTİB published a sermon praising ""our noble nation"" for rising against ""a wretched network"" that had sown ""seeds of sedition, rebellion and hostility.""According to Volker Beck, a member of the center-left Greens in Germany\'s Bundestag, ""That was not a religious text.It was a declaration of obedience to Mr. Erdoğan and his measures since the coup attempt,"" Volker Kauder, parliamentary group leader of the Germany\'s ruling Christian Democrats, the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU)/Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) faction, said Turkish-Germans should be loyal to Germany first and foremost.\n\nGermans of Turkish origin are being pressured in Germany by informers and officers of Turkey\'s MIT spy agency.According to reports Turkey had 6,000 informants plus MIT officers in Germany who were putting pressure on ""German Turks"".Hans-Christian Ströbele said that there was an ""unbelievable"" level of ""secret activities"" in Germany by Turkey\'s MIT agency.According to Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, not even the former communist East German Stasi secret police had managed to run such a large ""army of agents"" in the former West Germany: ""Here, it\'s not just about intelligence gathering, but increasingly about intelligence service repression.""\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nGermany\'s Office for Migration and Refugees said on 18 November 2016, it had received 4,437 political asylum requests from Turkish citizens up to October, compared to 1,767 for the whole of last year.""We must expect that the number of Turks who are seeking political asylum in Germany will continue to rise,"" said Stephan Mayer, the domestic policy speaker of the union coalition in the Bundestag.\n\nOn 10 December 2016, eleven Turkish nationals, 10 adults and one child, in a martial arts group have applied for asylum in Germany.\n\nAs of January 2018, Germany was first place and Greece second as EU destinations of choice for Turkish nationals requesting asylum after the coup attempt.\n\nTurkish police have carried out simultaneous raids in 18 cities against companies associated with United States-based Fethullah Gülen.The state-run Anadolu Agency said police searched 204 premises and detained 187 businessmen for ""membership in a terror organization"" and ""providing financial support to a terror organization"".All suspects\' assets were seized.\n\nWikiLeaks released Turkish emails and documents to respond to the Turkish government\'s purges that followed the coup attempt.In turn, the Turkish Telecommunications Communications Board blocked access to the WikiLeaks website.On 17 July 2016 Wikileaks had announced on Twitter, the leak of approximately 300,000 emails and over 500,000 documents, including those to and from AKP.\n\nWikiLeaks stated that it was attacked shortly after 17 July announcement of the planned publication and hypothesized that Turkish authorities were responsible.WikiLeaks stated in a tweet, ""our infrastructure is under sustained attack.""Tweets from WikiLeaks include ""We are unsure of the true origin of the attack.The timing suggests a Turkish state power faction or its allies.We will prevail & publish.""and: ""Turks will likely be censored to prevent them reading our pending release of 100k+ docs on politics leading up to the coup."", ""We ask that Turks are ready with censorship bypassing systems such as TorBrowser and uTorrent""; ""And that everyone else is ready to help them bypass censorship and push our links through the censorship to come.""\n\nUpon the release of the email dump, it has been reported that the emails contain little to no damning information, and instead are just mails from a public mailing list, but also linked externally to ""voter information on all of the women registered to vote in 78 out of Turkey\'s 81 provinces"".\n\nSeveral places were renamed to commemorate the failed coup: Boğaziçi Köprüsü (Bosphorus Bridge) → 15 Temmuz Şehitler Köprüsü Kızılay Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Kızılay Demokrasi Meydanı Ahmet Taner Kışlalı Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Milli İrade Meydanı (Reverted to original name a few days later) Büyük İstanbul Otogarı → İstanbul 15 Temmuz Demokrasi Otogarı In TRT, Yeni Haber Stüdyosu → 15 Temmuz Millet Stüdyosu Kazan → Kahramankazan about the province\'s local people\'s resistance to the coup plotters.Kahraman means ""hero"" in Turkish Niğde University → Niğde Ömer Halisdemir University\n\nIn 2018, the Istanbul Municipal Council decided to change the names of a total of 90 streets that included words which could be associated with FETÖ.\n\nThe Presidency of Religious Affairs stated that it would not be providing religious funeral services to the dead coupists, except for ""privates and low-ranking officers compelled by force and threats who found themselves in the midst of the conflict without full knowledge of anything"".\n\nA document dated 26 September 2016 showed that Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) asked Turkish missions and religious representatives abroad to profile Gülen movement expatriates living in their respective foreign countries.Gülen-linked schools, businesses, foundations, associations, media outlets and others were also included in the reports.Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs has gathered intelligence via imams from 38 countries.\n\nBelgium officials said they would withdraw recognition of Diyanet mosques in the country if necessary.\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nOn 21 December 2016, the Turkish government has recalled Yusuf Acar, the religious affairs attaché of the Turkish Embassy in the Netherlands, after Dutch authorities said he was spying.Acar collected information of people who sympathize with Fethullah Gülen at Netherlands and passed it on to the Turkish authorities.The Dutch government called spying activities an ""unwanted and non-acceptable interference in the lives of Dutch citizens.""and the attaché was reportedly declared persona non grata and received a ""deportation warning"" by Dutch authorities.\n\nOn 26 January 2017, President Erdoğan, during his visit to Tanzania, asked his Tanzanian counterpart John Magufuli to take action against the network of Fethullah Gülen.\n\nIn April 2017 it was announced that President Erdoğan planned to establish a purpose-built museum dedicated to the coup events, called the ""Museum of the 15 July: Martyrs and Democracy"", to be located in Kahramankazan, a town near Ankara.Paid for by Turkish Ministry of Culture funds, it is planned to open at the end of 2018.The museum opened in December 2019\n\nAmong the Turkish opposition parties, the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) issued a statement expressing their public opposition to the coup, and the Hürriyet Daily News reported that Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bahçeli telephoned Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım to express his opposition to the coup.The co-chairs of the opposition Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) issued a statement saying that the party was ""under all circumstances and as a matter of principle against all kinds of coup.""Amongst the minor parties, left-wing nationalist Patriotic Party\'s Doğu Perinçek backed democracy, when he held Gülen and the Americans responsible.Kurdish militant separatist organization Kurdistan Workers\' Party, which Turkey and its allies label as a terrorist organization, urged their supporters to stay away from the coup and rather defend their people, while the Communist Party called upon the people to overthrow the AKP government which they called an ""enemy of humanity"".\n\nDuring the first hours of the coup plotters\' moves of blocking Istanbul\'s bridges and flying fighter jets low over Istanbul and Ankara, Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjørn Jagland tweeted against the coup attempt and underlined that ""any attempt to overthrow the democratically elected leaders is unacceptable"".\n\nRussia\'s President Vladimir Putin called Erdoğan out of solidarity before all NATO member countries\' heads following the coup attempt.Erdoğan thanked the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev – who was the first president to show solidarity after the coup attempt – for his support in solving the 7-month crisis over downed Russian Sukhoi Su-24 and the Prime Minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, who was among the first NATO country leaders to condemn the coup attempt, already from the early hours of Saturday.\n\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the then prime minister of Pakistan, was all praise for the people of Turkey and the AKP government and strongly condemned what he termed as an attempt to undermine democracy in Turkey.""We deeply admire the resolve of the brave and resilient Turkish people, who stood up against the forces of darkness and anarchy to express their support and commitment to democracy,"" the PM said in a statement issued from his office.\n\nThe majority of countries either expressed their support for the government or called for restraint.On 16 July 2016, however, a proposed United Nations Security Council statement denouncing the coup was not accepted by Egypt, a non-permanent member of the Council at the time, due to textual disagreements.Egyptian diplomats said that the council is ""in no position to qualify, or label [the Turkish] government – or any other government for that matter – as democratically elected or not"".Objection by the United States and the UK – permanent members of the Security Council – led to Egypt proposing a new statement calling for all sides to ""respect the democratic and constitutional principles and the rule of law"", which was rejected, preventing the condemnation of the coup attempt by the Security Council.The leader of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky supported the coup attempt.\n\nAl-Monitor reported that ""Unlike Ankara\'s Western allies, Iran did not wait for the coup\'s failure to speak up.Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif voiced support for democracy in a Twitter message in the early hours of the unrest, writing ""Stability, and democracy in Turkey are paramount"".In a subsequent phone call after the failure of the coup attempt, President Hassan Rouhani told Erdoğan the coup attempt was ""a test to identify your domestic and foreign friends and enemies.""An Iranian official pointed out parallels between the coup attempt in Turkey and the coup against Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mussadiq in 1953: ""What we know is that this attempt was triggered by foreign hands.We have experienced the same thing in the past.Since Mr. Erdogan wants to play a more positive path in the region today, they want to overthrow him.""\n\nMustafa Akıncı, President of Northern Cyprus, welcomed the fact that ""no community in Turkey ... applauded the coup as they have done in the past.""Azerbaijan strongly condemned the attempted military coup in Turkey and considered such actions unacceptable according to a statement from Novruz Mammadov, deputy head of the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration and chief of the foreign relations department.\n\nEuropean Commissioner dealing with Turkey\'s EU membership bid, Johannes Hahn, said it appears Turkey\'s government prepared arrest lists of political opponents before the coup attempt and had been waiting for the right time to act.In this sense, EU reported that as a main criticism to put this issue in the category of terrorism become the violation of the fundamental rights and fundamental values of the citizens.Hence, it underlines a total divergence of opinions and mentality between EU and Turkey which reached a deadlock here especially after the 15th of July in 2016.\n\nOn 19 July 2016, White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said during a press briefing that President Barack Obama has held a phone conversation with President Erdoğan: ""The President used the phone call to reiterate once again the strong commitment of the United States to the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey.The President pledged any needed assistance to the Turkish government as they conduct an investigation to determine exactly what happened.""\n\nOn 20 July 2016, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""Turkey has a large armed force, professional armed forces and ...I am certain they will continue as a committed and strong NATO ally.""On a statement released on 10 August 2016, the Secretary General once more strongly condemned the attempted coup and reiterated full support for Turkey\'s democratic institutions.He also expressed support for the elected Turkish government and respect for the courage of the Turkish people for resisting the coup plotters.\n\nOn 29 July 2016, the commander of U.S. Central Command, General Joseph Votel, denied statements by Turkey\'s president Erdoğan that he has supported the coup attempt in Turkey.\n\nOn 1 August 2016, United States Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, General Joseph Dunford, visited Turkey and condemned the coup attempt.Dunford said: ""The consistent theme throughout the day was a reaffirmation of the importance of the U.S.-Turkey relationship – the need for us to cooperate.""\n\nOn July, 20, there were reports that a group of Turkish military commandos coup fugitives would try to cross from Turkey to the island of Symi, in the southeastern Aegean, at Greece.The Hellenic Coast Guard was on alert and increased the patrols in the area, especially after a group of inflatable dinghies and other vessels were seen departing from Datça, on the Turkish coast, in the direction of Symi, they monitored the movements of the Turkish vessels, which remained in Turkish waters.Furthermore, a contingent of the Hellenic Police was dispatched to Symi to conduct checks there.The Greek government had been anticipating a possible attempt by participants in the failed coup to come to Greece and took the reports seriously.Turkish F-16 fighter jets were also scrambled to check reports that missing Turkish coast guard vessels had appeared in Greek waters in the Aegean.Later on the day, the Turkish interior ministry denied reports that rebel soldiers might have ""hijacked"" a vessel to flee to Greece.The Greek armed forces remained on alert the throughout the day for potential coup fugitives.\n\nAccording to Michael Rubin, from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Erdoğan had himself to blame for the coup.Following an increasingly Islamist agenda, Erdoğan had reportedly ""dropped any pretense of governing for all Turks.""After ""fanning the flames"" at the 2013 Gezi Park protests, he transformed the predominantly Kurdish-inhabited areas of southeastern Turkey ""into a war zone reminiscent of the worst days of the 1980s.""The biggest problem, according to Rubin, might have been Erdoğan\'s foreign policy, which managed to turn the initial ""no problems with neighbors"" doctrine into a situation where the country has problems with almost every neighbor and has even alienated some of its allies and friends.Rubin previously worked as an official at the Pentagon and less than 4 months before the coup, he wrote an article in Newsweek magazine titled, ""Will There Be a Coup Against Erdogan in Turkey?""\n\nBritish Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk warned that ""too late did Erdoğan realize the cost of the role he had chosen for his country.It\'s one thing to say sorry to Putin and patch up relations with Netanyahu; but when you can no longer trust your army, there are more serious matters to concentrate upon.""Even if this coup may have failed, Fisk expected another to follow in the months or years to come.\n\nTurkish professor Akın Ünver described the coup d\'état attempt as ""more of a mutiny"".\n\nThe name of the ""Peace at Home Council"" – Yurtta Sulh Konseyi – is derived from Atatürk\'s famous saying \'Peace at Home, Peace in the World\'.Journalist Ezgi Başaran said that ""the statement of the junta, that was [...] read on the [...] government TV [channel] as the coup got under way, bore a strong resemblance to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk\'s famous address to the Turkish Youth.[...] On the other hand, given that these references are too obvious, they may have been intentionally included to insinuate a Kemalist junta rather than a Gülenist one.""\n\nThe citizen journalism site Bellingcat published an analysis of the messages of a WhatsApp group consisting of high-ranking military officials who had taken part in the coup covering their activities including them killing several people.The messages were cross referenced with video footage.The group was named ""Yurtta sulh"" which refers to a peace at home speech and they seem secular and military with no references to Gülen or anything related during the several hours of messaging.\n\nNews reports have suggested that the coup ringleader was Adil Öksüz.Some believe Öksüz to have been an operative with Turkish intelligence.\n\nGerman Islamic studies scholar said the putschists tried to forestall a large-scale purge of judiciary and military, the implementation of which had already started on Saturday, the day after the coup attempt.According to Turkish investigative journalist Ahmet Şık, a list of officials to be purged had been ready compiled by the attorney-general of Izmir, Okan Bato, and was approved by President Erdoğan.According to this version, the putschists had to quickly bring forward their coup attempt before being disposed and arrested.\n\nDuring and after the events, several politicians and commentators suggested that the government knew about the coup in advance and possibly directed it.The facts that the coup attempt began in the evening rather than at a more inconspicuous time and that the events were largely confined to Ankara and Istanbul contributed to doubts about the authenticity of the coup attempt.Journalists and opposition politicians branded it a \'tragic comedy\' and \'theatre play\'.Advocates of such theories pointed to how Erdoğan stood to gain from the coup attempt in terms of increasing his popularity and support for his calls for an executive presidency, while being able to legitimize further crackdowns on judicial independence and the opposition in general.\n\nOther elements that were reported to support the theory included: no list of demands by the coup plotters, the organization and response of the police, the long lists of arrests that seemed to be ready surprisingly quickly (including arrests of 2,745 judges and 2,839 soldiers), and the obvious nature of the coup actions.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom Erdoğan had said as being one of the principal conspirators, commented, ""I don\'t believe that the world believes the accusations made by President Erdoğan.There is a possibility that it could be a staged coup and it could be meant for further accusations [against the Gülenists].""Journalist Cengiz Çandar, a veteran observer of Turkey\'s coups, said ""I have never seen any with this magnitude of such inexplicable sloppiness.""Prominent Hizmet (Gülen movement) spokesman Alp Aslandogan said, referencing that the Turkish Air Force commander met with Erdoğan before 15 July, that certain legal documentation related to the coup seemed written beforehand, arguing that within ""the indictment written by a prosecutor on the night of 15 July to 16 July, there were events there that didn\'t actually happen.Some events did happen, but those events didn\'t happen by the time the document started.It looks like a bigger plan was there, and part of the plan did not come to pass.""\n\nThe organization and spontaneous synchronization by large numbers of mosques was perceived to be unachievable unless there had been prior preparation, with journalists also pointing to how Erdoğan could have strategically used the call to prayer to invoke religious sentiment in a political situation as a veiled attack on state secularism.\n\nThousands of arrests and purges were conducted by Turkish authorities between 16 and 18 July 2016.The sheer number of these arrests made at such a speed could only be done so if the ""Turkish government had all those lists ready"", as suggested by Johannes Hahn, European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, on 18 July 2016.Hahn also said that because these lists were already available immediately after the coup, the ""event was prepared"" and the lists were to be used ""at a certain stage"".\n\nMehmet Dişli, who was seen giving orders to the coup plotters and who was the one who put a belt around Hulusi Akar\'s neck to make him sign, is the brother of Şaban Dişli, a former vice president of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and confidant of Erdoğan.\n\nSeveral social media users have compared the coup attempt to the Reichstag fire in 1933, which Adolf Hitler used as an excuse to suspend civil liberties and order mass arrests of his opponents.Politico correspondent Ryan Heath said that ""the coup was staged to allow Erdoğan to purge the military of opponents and increase his grip on the country"".Heath used Twitter to share comments from his Turkish source, who called the events of Friday night a ""fake coup"" which would help a ""fake democracy warrior"" (referring to Erdoğan).The source said: ""Probably we\'ll see an early election [in] which he\'ll try to guarantee an unbelievable majority of the votes.And this will probably guarantee another 10–15 years of authoritarian, elected dictatorship.""\n\nThe New York Times reported that some Turkish citizens believed the coup attempt was staged by Erdoğan to improve his public image and popularity, while cracking down on political opponents and expanding his power.Critics found it suspect that reportedly no government officials were arrested or harmed during the attempted coup, which—among other factors—raised the suspicion of a false flag event staged by the Turkish government to crack down on opposition parties.Those in Turkey suggesting that the coup was staged are also being questioned by the government.\n\nPoliticians and journalists who were skeptical of the authenticity of the coup plot said that in reality, a \'civil coup\' had effectively been staged against the Armed Forces and Judiciary, both of which were extensively purged of stated Gülen supporters by the government shortly after the events.Skeptics said that the coup would be used as an excuse for further erosion of judicial independence and a crackdown on the opposition, giving the AKP greater and unstoppable power over all state institutions and paving the way for a more radical Islamist agenda at odds with the founding principles of the Turkish Republic.\n\nJustice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said in late July 2016 that Turkish social media users who said the government was staging the coup faced investigation: ""Just look at the people who are saying on social media that this was theatre.Public prosecutors are already investigating them.Most of them are losers who think it is an honor to die for Fethullah Gülen\'s command.""\n\nOn 12 July 2017, Stockholm Center for Freedom, a monitoring group with reported links to the Gülen movement, published a controversial report stating that President Erdogan orchestrated the coup bid as a false flag to consolidate his powers, set up his opposition for a mass persecution, and push Turkish Armed Forces into a military incursion into Syria.According to the report, it uncovered new evidence from 11 July 2016, four days before the planned coup bid, that a secret plan was circulated among select group of Armed Forces to give an appearance of a coup attempt.The plan was sanctioned by intelligence and military chiefs with the approval of Erdogan.\n\nIn early November 2017, Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for , former Director of the Middle East Program of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, stating that he is an agent of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), that he was present in Istanbul during the 2016 Turkish coup attempt, and that he was one of the key organizers behind the coup attempt.Around 1 December, the Istanbul prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for Graham E. Fuller, an American author and political analyst specializing in Islamic extremism after a long CIA career and holding the role of vice-chair of the United States National Intelligence Council.The prosecutor\'s office based the warrant on suspicion of Fuller helping to plan the coup attempt.Hürriyet stated that Turkish authorities believed that they had traced Fuller\'s location before the attempted coup and afterward when he left Turkey.\n\nBarkey denied his reported role in the coup, describing the claims as ""so ludicrous that they do not even deserve the term \'science fiction\'.""\n\nDeep state in Turkey The Imam\'s Army List of coups and coup attempts since 2010 List of modern conflicts in the Middle East List of attacks on legislatures\n', 'Claim_Context': 'In March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.

114,"{'Wiki_Title': '2016 Turkish coup attempt', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'On 15 July 2016, a faction within the Turkish Armed Forces, organized as the Peace at Home Council, attempted a coup d\'état against state institutions, including the government and president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.They attempted to seize control of several places in Ankara, Istanbul, Marmaris and elsewhere, such as the Asian side entrance of the Bosphorus Bridge, but failed to do so after forces and civilians loyal to the state defeated them.The Council cited an erosion of secularism, elimination of democratic rule, disregard for human rights, and Turkey\'s loss of credibility in the international arena as reasons for the coup.The government said it had evidence the coup leaders were linked to the Gülen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the Republic of Turkey and led by Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish businessman and a well-known Islamic scholar who lives in exile in Pennsylvania.The Turkish government alleged that Gülen was behind the coup (which Gülen denied) and that the United States was harboring him.Events surrounding the coup attempt and the purges in its aftermath reflect a complex power struggle between Islamist elites in Turkey.\n\nDuring the coup attempt, over 300 people were killed and more than 2,100 were injured.Many government buildings, including the Turkish Parliament and the Presidential Palace, were bombed from the air.Mass arrests followed, with at least 40,000 detained, including at least 10,000 soldiers and 2,745 judges, for being affiliated with the coup attempt.15,000 education staff were also suspended and the licenses of 21,000 teachers working at private institutions were revoked after the government stated they were loyal to Gülen.More than 77,000 people have been arrested and over 160,000 fired from their jobs, on reports of connections to Gülen.\n\nThere were many reactions against the coup attempt, both domestically and internationally.The main opposition parties in Turkey condemned the attempt, while several international leaders—such as those of the United States, NATO, the European Union, and neighboring countries—called for ""respect of the democratic institutions in Turkey and its elected officials.""Many international organizations also opposed the coup.The United Nations Security Council, however, did not denounce the coup after disagreements over the phrasing of a statement.Iran opposed the coup and advised Erdogan to defeat the coup plotters.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the head of United States Central Command, General Joseph Votel, was ""siding with coup plotters"", after Votel criticized the Turkish government for arresting the Pentagon\'s contacts in Turkey.\n\nIn March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.The same month, the British Parliament\'s Foreign Affairs Select Committee said some Gulenists were involved in the coup d\'état attempt but found no hard evidence that Fethullah Gülen masterminded the failed coup and found no evidence to justify the United Kingdom designating the Gülen movement as a ""terrorist organization"".\n\nSince the 1970s, followers of the influential cleric Fethullah Gülen had assumed increasingly important positions within the Turkish state apparatus.Gülen several times advised his followers to take key positions in society and government, if necessary with a secret identity to avoid opposition from the laicistic Turkish army and government.Nevertheless, at the start of the 21st century, Gülen\'s followers achieved crucial positions of power in Turkey (and beyond) with a vast network of newspapers, TV channels, schools, associations, lobby organizations, financial institutions and positions within the state such as the army and the judiciary.Initially, the then Prime Minister Erdogan seemingly tolerated the power of the Gülen movement because of common interests such as limiting the undemocratic political power of the military, but also because of impotence and fear of Gülen\'s power within Turkey.\n\nA series of events eventually led to a rift between Erdogan and Gülen.For example, prosecutors that allegedly were aligned with the Gülen movement tried to arrest the intelligence chief Hakan Fidan for the peace negotiations with the PKK, and by extension PM Erdogan subsequently, as the Turkish secret service is directly subordinate to the prime minister of Turkey.During this period (2010-2013), state secrets were leaked, fraud was committed with the entrance exams for government employees (KPSS), a change of power occurred at the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) and (sex)tapes of both government members and opposition members were leaked.Following these events and other incidents, the Turkish government decided to designate the Gülen movement as parallel state and FETÖ (Fethullahist Terror Organization).Alleged Gülen supporters were fired or arrested.The coup attempt that followed is therefore also described by some analysts as a last desperate attempt by Gülenists to retain power.\n\nIt is widely reported that Kemalist ideology played a huge role in motivating the 15 July 2016 coup attempt, like all previous political interventions in the history of Turkey\'s military coups.Since the establishment of multiparty democracy in Turkey in 1946, the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), together with the judiciary, have viewed themselves as guardians of Kemalist ideals and the secular Turkish nationalist state established under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk against political parties that have promoted a larger role for Islam and minorities in public life.The military and judiciary have regularly intervened in politics to block or ban popular parties representing conservative Muslim Turks, attempting to relax the restrictions on traditional religious practices, such as women\'s wearing of headscarves.The military has toppled four elected governments: by coups in 1960 and 1980, and by military decisions in 1971 and 1997.The military has also banned several major political parties.In 1998, Erdoğan, then-mayor of Istanbul, was banned for life from politics and jailed because he had read a religious poem by Ziya Gökalp several years before, at a public meeting.In 2007, the military expressed its opposition to the election of Abdullah Gül, of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), as president, by issuing an e-memorandum.Still, Gül was eventually elected when the AKP won both a referendum on the matter.Also, a snap election, and the party returned with a larger majority in the parliament.The military cited erosion of secularism as one of the reasons for the coup in the statement published on the day of the coup.\n\nAs opposed to previous political interventions by the Turkish military, Turkey\'s AKP government and pro-state media maintain that the 15 July 2016 coup attempt was not motivated by allegiance to Kemalist ideology, but rather to the vast political, economic, and religious network led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen.Between 2007 and 2012, high-profile Kemalists, including high-ranking officers of the Turkish Armed Forces, faced a series of trials and purges, under reports of involvement in a secret society codenamed ""Ergenekon.""Supported by Islamist (both pro-Gülen and pro-Erdoğan) prosecutors, security officials, and media, the purges allowed lower-rank Islamist officers to assume high-ranking military positions.They were seen as a bid by Turkey\'s civilian leaders under President Erdoğan to establish dominance over the military.In these trials in 2013 – viewed as ""sensational"" and ""one of the biggest in recent Turkish history"" – 275 people, including senior military officers, journalists, lawyers, and academics, were said to be involved in the so-called ""Ergenekon"" conspiracy, reportedly plotting a coup in 2003/04 against then–Prime Minister Erdoğan.Additionally, some military officers were said to be involved in a separate reported plot, Sledgehammer.Simultaneously, Erdoğan promoted lower-ranking officers up the chain of command, ensuring that the military chief of staff was loyal to him and thereby demoralizing the army.\n\nThe AKP\'s alliance with Gülen started to collapse during 2013 as Gülenists targeted the AKP using corruption charges.After the split, Erdoğan decided it would be advantageous to rehabilitate the army.The ""Ergenekon"" convictions were overturned in April 2016 by the Court of Cassation, which ruled that the existence of the network was unproven.\n\nIn 2013, law enforcement efforts to fight corruption, which had led to the 2013 corruption scandal in Turkey, were faulted by Erdoğan.The anti-corruption efforts were a source of tension between the Gülenists and the AKP.In political analysis in the months prior to the coup attempt, the incidence of corruption was reported to be ""rife"" in Turkey.Following the coup attempt, some coup leaders cited corruption as a reason for their actions.\n\nOn 13 July, less than two days before the coup was launched, Erdoğan signed a bill giving Turkish soldiers immunity from prosecution while taking part in domestic operations.The bill requires cases against commanders to be approved by the prime minister, while district governors may sign cases against lower-ranking soldiers.The immunity bill was seen as part of the détente between the government and the armed forces.The latter has increasingly been taking over military operations in Kurdish-inhabited areas from police and paramilitary units.\n\nOn 15 July 2016, as reported just before 23:00 EEST (UTC+3), military jets were spotted flying over Ankara, and both the Fatih Sultan Mehmet and Bosphorus bridges in Istanbul were closed.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said military action was being ""taken outside the chain of command"" and it was an ""illegal attempt"" to seize power by ""part of the military"".He further said that those involved ""will pay the highest price.""Local media also reported tanks in Istanbul\'s Atatürk Airport.It was reported that Internet users within Turkey were blocked from accessing Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.Twitter later stated that it had ""no reason to think we\'ve been fully blocked"".Some hostages were taken at military headquarters, including the Turkish Chief of the General Staff Hulusi Akar.At around 21:00, the coupists had invited Salih Zeki Çolak, the commander of the Turkish Land Forces to the military headquarters.When he arrived, he was immediately apprehended.Abidin Ünal, head of the Turkish Air Force, who had been attending a wedding in Istanbul, was abducted from there by soldiers who descended from a helicopter.The coupists then tried to force Akar to sign the coup declaration, almost strangling him using a belt in the process.He refused and was then taken to the Akıncı Air Base and other commanders at the headquarters.The military also entered the Justice and Development Party\'s offices in Istanbul and asked people to leave.\n\nEarly reports said President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was safe in Marmaris, south-west Turkey, where he had been on holiday.\n\nFrom around 23:00 to midnight, helicopters bombed the police special forces headquarters and police air force headquarters in Gölbaşı, just outside of Ankara.The attacks left 42 dead and 43 injured.Türksat headquarters in Gölbaşı was also attacked, killing two security personnel.\n\nAt around 23:50, soldiers occupied Taksim Square in central Istanbul.\n\nAt 00:02, it was reported by Reuters that soldiers were inside the buildings of the state broadcaster, the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), in Ankara.During the coup attempt, soldiers forced anchor Tijen Karaş to read out a statement saying that ""the democratic and secular rule of law has been eroded by the current government"" and that Turkey was now led by the Peace at Home Council who would ""ensure the safety of the population.""The statement read in part: ""Turkish Armed Forces have completely taken over the administration of the country to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedoms, the rule of law and general security that was damaged.[...] All international agreements are still valid.We hope that all of our good relationships with all countries will continue.""The plotters said they had ""done so to preserve democratic order, and that the rule of law must remain a priority"".The statement also ordered temporary martial law (sıkıyönetim), and said a new constitution would be prepared ""as soon as possible"".TRT was then taken off air.\n\nOther media outlets were also raided by the putschists, such as Turkish newspaper Hürriyet and private broadcaster CNN Türk.\n\nReuters reported on 15 July that an EU source described the coup as ""well orchestrated,"" and predicted that ""given the scale of the operation, it is difficult to imagine they will stop short of prevailing.""Another EU diplomat said that the Turkish ambassador in his capital was shocked and ""taking it very seriously"".\n\nThe Peace at Home Council was reportedly chaired by Muharrem Köse.\n\nAdana: Upon receiving the intelligence that thirty soldiers from the 10th Air Base Command would move to the base where the regional and provincial gendarmerie commands were located, the police prevented the soldiers from leaving the guardhouse with TOMA and armored vehicles and blocked them.Bitlis: In the Tatvan district of Bitlis, on the orders of Brigade Commander Arif Seddar Afşar, helicopters were circulated in the skies of Tatvan and fired at the city.The brigade command left the municipality\'s construction equipment in front of the barracks in case there was a tank operation in the district.Denizli: Approximately five hundred officers and non-commissioned officers who participated in the coup attempt surrendered to the gendarmerie and police forces.They were interrogated at Çardak District Gendarme Command.Kars: With the order of Kars 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, the soldiers who came with tanks and armored personnel carriers surrounded the Police Headquarters building and wanted to detain Faruk Karaduman, the chief of police.At the same hours, the invitation of Deputy Governors, 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, went to the command.Kocaeli: Turkcell\'s data center in Gebze was raided by soldiers who participated in the coup attempt.Soldiers who tried to interrupt the internet service were detained.Malatya: A rebellious soldier opened fire inside a base of the Turkish 2nd Army, damaging six vehicles.The base was besieged by police and loyal soldiers, and the shooter was captured.Marmaris: Three military helicopters carried out a bomb attack on the hotel where Erdoğan was staying.Forty rebellious soldiers of the Special Forces Command clashed with the police in the region.Mersin: Mersin Garrison and Mediterranean Region Commander Admiral Nejat Atilla Demirhan called Mersin Provincial Police Deputy Chief Yakup Usta and Gendarmerie Colonel Mustafa Bakçepınar and stated that the Turkish Armed Forces had taken over the administration.He introduced himself as the martial law garrison commander and ordered Mersin Governor Özdemir Çakacak and district governors to be taken into custody.Demirhan and Dağdelen, who made the same announcement with the police radio obtained from Mersin Police Department, were detained through the operation of the security forces.Sakarya: Sakarya Governorship was captured with armored personnel carriers, military trucks and many military jeeps from the military unit in the Kandıra district of Kocaeli.As a reinforcement, two military vehicles full of soldiers from the Sakarya central division command had to return to their barracks in the face of the resistance of the police and the harsh reaction of the people who took to the streets against the putschists.The vehicles occupying the Sakarya Governorate were seized by the citizens and the soldiers in them were neutralized and handed over to the security forces.Afterwards, citizens and security forces entered the governor\'s office and neutralized the soldiers there and suppressed the uprising in the province.Eight civilian citizens were injured as a result of the fire opened by the military during the incident.Şırnak: Çakırsöğüt Gendarmerie Commando Brigadier General Ali Osman Gürcan and 309 soldiers, that participated in the coup attempt, were detained by the security forces.\n\nTurkey\'s Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım responded to the events by stating that an ""illegal action is taking place outside of the chain of command"".He also said that ""the government elected by the people remains in charge and this government will only go when the people say so.""The Turkish Presidential office said President Erdoğan was on holiday inside Turkey and condemned the coup attempt as an attack on democracy.A presidential source also said Erdoğan and his government were still in power.The first messages from Erdoğan were transmitted at around 00:23At about 01:00, Erdoğan did a FaceTime interview with CNN Türk, in which he called upon his supporters to take to the streets in defiance of the military-imposed curfew, saying ""There is no power higher than the power of the people.Let them do what they will at the public squares and airports.""Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş appeared on live television, saying Turkey\'s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is still in charge of the government.The mayor of Ankara, Melih Gökçek of the AKP, encouraged people to go out to the city\'s streets in defiance, despite a curfew imposed by the military.Erdoğan\'s plane took off from Dalaman Airport near Marmaris at 23:47, but had to wait in the air south of Atatürk for the airport to be secured.His plane landed at 02:50\n\nThe First Army General Command in Istanbul stated in a news conference that the TSK did not support the coup and the perpetrators represented a tiny faction that were on the verge of being brought under control.Istanbul Atatürk Airport was closed; all flights from the airport were cancelled.There was an explosion in the TRT broadcasting headquarters and gunfire was reported in Ankara.Soon after, it was stormed by a crowd of civilians and police, with four soldiers inside reportedly being ""neutralized"".The channel went back on air and Karaş, who had previously announced the coup, said live that she had been held hostage and forced to read the declaration of the coup at gunpoint.\n\nBy 01:00, it was reported that the military had pulled its forces from the Atatürk airport and people were coming inside, but by 01:13, it was reported that tanks were inside the airport and gunfire was heard.\n\nTanks opened fire near the Turkish Parliament Building.The parliamentary building was also hit from the air.Injuries were reported among protesters following gunfire on Bosphorus Bridge.\n\nA helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was shot down by a Turkish military F-16 fighter jet.There were also reports of pro-state jets flying over Ankara to ""neutralize"" helicopters used by those behind the coup.\n\nAt 03:08, a military helicopter opened fire on the Turkish parliament.At 03:10, Turkish Armed Forces stated on their website that they had complete control over the country.At 03:12, Yıldırım made a statement saying that the situation was under control and that a no-fly zone was declared over Ankara and that military planes that still flew would be shot down.\n\nIt was reported that the Turkish parliament had been bombed again at 03:23 and 03:33.A helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was also seen flying by it.Half an hour following the report of 12 deaths and 2 injuries in the parliament, soldiers entered CNN Türk\'s headquarters and forced the studio to go off air.After an hour of interruption by the pro-coup soldiers, CNN Türk resumed its broadcast.Later, İsmail Kahraman said a bomb exploded at a corner of the public relations building inside the parliament, with no deaths but several injuries among police officers.\n\nAt around 04:00 two or three helicopters attacked Erdogan\'s hotel.According to eyewitness accounts, ten to fifteen heavily armed men landed and started firing.In the ensuing conflict, two policemen were killed and 8 were injured.\n\nThe Doğan News Agency reported that in Istanbul several individuals were injured after soldiers fired on a group of people attempting to cross the Bosphorus Bridge in protest of the attempted coup.\n\nOn Saturday 16 July 2016, at 00:42 EEST (UTC+3), a Turkish Black Hawk helicopter sent a distress signal and requested permission from Greek authorities for an emergency landing, and landed eight minutes later (00:50) at the Dimokritos airport in Alexandroupoli, in Greece, while two Greek F-16s observed the procedure and escorted it to the airport.The first reports said that the passengers were seven military personnel and a civilian.Later, it turned out that all were military personnel (two majors, four captains and two non-commissioned officers).They had removed the badges and insignia from their uniforms, making it impossible to know their rank.All were arrested after landing for illegal entry into the country.They were transferred to the local police station, while the Greek authorities at the airport guarded the helicopter.The eight passengers all requested political asylum in Greece as they believed they would not get a fair trial in Turkey.On 21 September 2016, Greece denied three out of the eight asylum.The men\'s lawyer Stavroula Tomara said they would be appealing the decision and said they had the ""impression that the decision has been predetermined, and that the interview was conducted just as a formality.""On 11 October 2016, four more of the eight were denied asylum.Two of the men who had previously been denied asylum applied for a re-evaluation but their applications were also rejected.\n\nAfter Erdoğan flew into Istanbul, he made a televised speech inside the airport at around 04:00, whilst thousands gathered outside.He addressed a crowd of supporters in the airport, at about 06:30 He said, ""In Turkey, armed forces are not governing the state or leading the state.They cannot.""He blamed ""those in Pennsylvania"" (a reference to Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, and his Hizmet Movement) for the coup attempt.Erdoğan also said he had plans to ""clean up"" the army, saying that ""This uprising is a gift from God to us.""State-run Anadolu Agency named former Colonel Muharrem Köse, who in March 2016 was dishonorably discharged for reported association with Gülen, as the suspected leader of the coup.However, the Alliance for Shared Values, a non-profit organization associated with Gülen, released a statement reiterating that it condemns any military intervention in domestic politics, and saying Erdoğan\'s allegations against the movement were ""highly irresponsible"".Gülen himself said in a brief statement just before midnight: ""As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nReuters reported that in early hours of 16 July, the coup appeared to have ""crumbled"" as crowds defied pro-coup military orders and gathered in major squares of Istanbul and Ankara to oppose it.Reuters also reported pro-coup soldiers surrendering to the police in Taksim Square, Istanbul.It was reported that by 05:18, Atatürk airport had completely been recaptured by the government whilst the police had surrounded the coupists inside the Turkish army headquarters, calling for them to surrender.Between 06:00–08:00 a skirmish took place there.In Akar\'s absence, Ümit Dündar, head of the First Army, was appointed Acting Chief of Staff.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning of 16 July, soldiers blocking the Bosphorus Bridge surrendered to the police.According to the government-run Anadolu Agency, this consisted of a group of 50 soldiers.Some of these soldiers were lynched by civilians despite the police\'s efforts, who fired into the air to protect the surrendering soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile, in the headquarters of the Turkish Army, 700 unarmed soldiers surrendered as the police conducted an operation into the building while 150 armed soldiers were kept inside by the police.The coupists in the TRT building in Istanbul surrendered in the early morning as well.Chief of Staff Akar, held hostage at the Akıncı Air Base in Ankara, was also rescued by pro-state forces.\n\nOne of the primary reasons that the coup failed was chaos among the plotters\' ranks.Turkey\'s National Intelligence Organization (MİT) head Hakan Fidan discovered the coup plot, and the plotters were forced to execute the coup five hours ahead of schedule.One of the main organizers, General Semih Terzi, was shot dead by loyalist Sgt.Maj.Ömer Halisdemir at the onset, demoralizing and disrupting command and control of the rebels.These two incidents resulted in the coup being carried out in an uncoordinated manner.The highest ranking staff officers opposed the coup, and publicly ordered all personnel to return to their barracks.Acting outside the military chain of command, the rebels lacked the coordination and resources to achieve their goals.The conscripted soldiers that the rebels mobilized were uninformed of their mission\'s true purpose and became demoralized.Many surrendered rather than shoot demonstrators.The commander of the First Army in Istanbul, General Ümit Dündar, personally called Erdoğan to warn him of the plot, persuading him to evacuate his hotel ahead of the plotters, and helped to secure Istanbul for Erdoğan to land.The MİT also mobilized its anti-aircraft guns, which the plotters were unaware existed, deterring rebel jets and commando teams.\n\nEqually important to the coup\'s failure, according to military strategist Edward N. Luttwak, was the inability of the rebels to neutralize Erdoğan and other high ranking government officials, either by killing or detaining them.A unit of special forces was sent via helicopter to kill or capture the president, but missed because he had been evacuated by his security detail just minutes before.Once Erdoğan landed at Atatürk International Airport (which had been recaptured from the rebels by his supporters), It became highly unlikely that the coup attempt would succeed.According to a military source, several rebel F-16s targeted Erdoğan\'s presidential jet en route to Istanbul, but they did not fire.A senior Turkish counter-terrorism official later stated that the jets did not fire because the fighter jet pilots were told by President Erdoğan\'s pilot over the radio that the (flight of the) Gulfstream IV was a Turkish Airlines flight.\n\nAccording to Naunihal Singh, author of Seizing Power, the coup attempt also failed because the plotters failed to secure control of the media and shape the narrative.Successful coups require that the rebels control the mass media.This allows even small rebel contingents to portray themselves as fully in control, and their victory as inevitable.Consequently, they convince the public, along with neutral and even loyalist soldiers, to defect to them or not resist.The rebels failed to properly broadcast their messages effectively across the media that they controlled.They failed to capture Türksat, Turkey\'s main cable and satellite communications company, and failed to gain control of the country\'s television and mobile phone networks.This allowed Erdoğan to make his Facetime call, and to speak on television.\n\nOther scholars of civil-military relations, like Drew H. Kinney, have said reports like Luttwak and Singh\'s miss the point of their own analysis: civil resistance thwarted the coup.Luttwak argues that wayward elements of the Turkish armed forces could not silence Erdoğan.Singh says that the rebels could not project success because they couldn\'t control the message.Kinney states that neither of these reasons on their own matter, but rather it\'s their effect—civil disobedience—that is important.We might find that ""[Gülen\'s movement] ...[might] have had nothing to do with the attempted takeover in July, but civilians [nevertheless] definitely played a role in thwarting the coup,"" writes Kinney.""...[A]n unhappy civilian populace mobilized to face down the military.""\n\nErdoğan wasn\'t censored (Luttwak\'s point) and was therefore able to use FaceTime to mobilize resistance, which in turn hindered the conspirators\' ability to project success (Singh\'s point).The result is civilian resistance to soldiers, i.e., people power.The reason Singh, Luttwak, and other scholars of civil-military relations miss this is, according to Kinney, because they ""usually do not study extra-military reasons for coup failures/successes,"" but rather put a premium on ""the inner-workings of the [military] operation.""In short, they blame the military for its failure rather than acknowledge the power of the masses and their successes.\n\nPro-state forces sent text messages to every Turkish citizen calling for them to protest against the coup attempt.Throughout the night sela prayers were repeatedly called from mosque minarets across the country to encourage people to resist the coup plotters.While the sela is usually called from minarets to inform the public of a funeral, they are also traditionally performed to notify of a significant event, in this case ""to rally people"".\n\nThe coup plotters initiated their operation hours ahead of the planned time when they understood that their plans had been compromised.Had the coup been launched at its original time, the middle of the night, much of the population would have been asleep.The streets would have been mostly empty.\n\nReports have emerged, neither confirmed nor denied by Russia or Turkey that the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate intercepted signals on an imminent coup passed on to loyal Turkish operatives.The intercepted plans revealed several helicopters with commandos were on the way to Marmaris\'s coastal resort, where Erdoğan stayed, capturing or killing him.Pre-warned, Erdoğan left quickly to avoid them.\n\nAn extensive purge of the Turkish civil service began in the wake of the coup attempt, with President Erdoğan warning his opponents that ""they will pay a heavy price for this.""The New York Times along with some other Western media such as The Economist, described the purges as a ""counter-coup"", with the Times expecting the president to ""become more vengeful and obsessed with control than ever, exploiting the crisis not just to punish mutinous soldiers but to further quash whatever dissent is left in Turkey,"".As of 20 July 2016, the purge already had seen over 45,000 military officials, police officers, judges, governors and civil servants arrested or suspended, including 2,700 judges, 15,000 teachers, and every university dean in the country.\n\n163 generals and admirals were detained, around 45% of the Turkish military\'s total.\n\nOn 18 July 2016, United States State Secretary John Kerry urged Turkish authorities to halt the increasing crackdown on its citizens, indicating that the crackdown was meant to ""suppress dissent.""French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault voiced concern, warning against a ""political system which turns away from democracy"" in response to the purges.\n\nOn 17 August 2016, Turkey started releasing what was expected to eventually amount to about 38,000 prison inmates, to make more space in the penal system for detainees, numbering about 35,000, who were arrested or detained after being involved in or suspected of association, with the 2016 failed coup.\n\nOn 28 September 2016, Turkish justice minister Bekir Bozdağ said 70,000 people had been processed and 32,000 were formally arrested.\n\nMajor General Cahit Bakir, who commanded Turkish forces under NATO in Afghanistan, and Brigadier General Sener Topuc, responsible for education and aid in Afghanistan, were detained by authorities in Dubai connected with the failed coup.\n\nGeneral Akın Öztürk, former Commander of the Turkish Air Force, was the Turkish military attaché to Israel.He was arrested on charges of having played a leading role in the failed coup.Öztürk has denied the charges.\n\nGeneral Adem Huduti, the commander of the Second Army, positioned along the southern borders with Syria and Iraq, and General Erdal Öztürk, the commander of the 3rd Corps, were also arrested.\n\nRear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been stationed at NATO\'s Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk, Virginia, sought asylum in the United States after being recalled by the Turkish government.\n\nIn July 2018, Istanbul\'s 25th Criminal Court sentenced 72 former soldiers involved in the coup attempt to life in prison.\n\nOn 20 June 2019, a terrorism court in Turkey sentenced 151 people to life in prison, including General Akın Öztürk, former commander of Turkish Air Force and the most senior officer involved in the coup.128 people received ""aggravated life"" sentences, which indicates harsh conditions without parole, for their role in the coup, with another 23 receiving standard life sentences.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom President Erdoğan said as one of the principal conspirators, condemned the coup attempt and denied any role in it.""I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey,"" he said in an emailed statement reported by The New York Times.""Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force.I pray to God for Turkey, Turkish citizens, and all those currently in Turkey that this situation is resolved peacefully and quickly.As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nPresident Erdoğan asked the United States to extradite Gülen: ""I call on you again, after there was a coup attempt.Extradite this man in Pennsylvania to Turkey!If we are strategic partners or model partners, do what is necessary.""Prime Minister Yildirim has threatened war against any country that would support Gülen.Turkish Labor Minister Süleyman Soylu said that ""America is behind the coup.""\n\nRegarding the AKP\'s statement against Gülen, Secretary of State Kerry invited the Turkish government ""to present us with any legitimate evidence that withstands scrutiny,"" before they would accept an extradition request.\n\nOn 15 August 2016, former United States diplomat James Jeffrey, who was the United States ambassador to Turkey from 2008 until 2010 made the following remarks: ""The Gülen movement has some infiltration at the least in the military that I am aware of.They of course had extreme infiltration into the police and judiciary earlier.I saw that when I was in Turkey previously, particularly in the Sledgehammer case, Hakan Fidan case, and the corruption cases in 2013.Obviously, significant segment of Turkey\'s bureaucracy was infiltrated and had their allegiance to a movement.That of course is absolutely unacceptable and extremely dangerous.It likely led to the coup attempt.""\n\nOutside Turkey, in Beringen, Belgium, anti-coup protesters attempted to attack a building owned by the pro-Gülen movement group \'Vuslat\'.The police brought in a water cannon to keep the attackers at bay.In news articles it was stated that the police also protected the houses of Gülen supporters.People advocated on social media to go to Beringen once more, and there was unrest in Heusden-Zolder, elsewhere in Belgium.Furthermore, in Somalia the government ordered ""the total closure of all activities"" of an organization linked to the Gülen movement, and gave its staff seven days to leave the country.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, President Erdoğan said Western countries were ""supporting terrorism"" and the military coup, saying ""I\'m calling on the United States: what kind of strategic partners are we, that you can still host someone whose extradition I have asked for?""\n\nOn 31 January 2017, British Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, Alan Duncan said he believed the Gülen movement was responsible for the coup attempt.Duncan went on saying ""the organization which incorporated itself into the state tried to topple the democratic structure in Turkey"".\n\nIn a speech on 29 July 2016, President Erdoğan said U.S. Central Command chief Joseph Votel was ""siding with coup plotters""; Erdoğan said the United States was protecting Fethullah Gülen, whom the Turkish government blames for the coup attempt.Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim made similar comments.In response, Votel said that the Turkish government\'s statements were ""unfortunate and completely inaccurate"" and expressed concern that the mass arrests and firings of military officers would damage military cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey.Similarly, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said that the Turkish military purges were impairing the fight against ISIS.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, in an escalation of tensions with the United States, Erdoğan questioned Turkey\'s relationship with the United States and criticized the West, saying that ""script"" for the abortive putsch last month was ""written abroad"".Erdoğan stated that he had personally asked Obama to extradite Gülen to Turkey.When the U.S. government replied it would need evidence of the cleric\'s guilt before extradition, to which Erdoğan said: ""When you asked for the return of a terrorist, we did not ask for documentation. ...Let us put him on trial.""\n\nYeni Şafak daily, a Turkish pro-state newspaper, stated that the former commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, now-retired United States Army General John F. Campbell, was the ""mastermind"" behind the coup attempt in Turkey.Campbell called the statement ""absolutely ridiculous"" and President Obama said ""Any reports that we had any previous knowledge of a coup attempt, that there was any U.S. involvement in it, that we were anything other than entirely supportive of Turkish democracy are completely false, unequivocally false.""\n\nOn 1 December 2017, Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for American political analyst, former CIA official and former vice chairman of US National Intelligence Council Graham Fuller, stating his involvement in the coup.A career US State Department official who was once CIA Station Chief in Kabul and later went on to be a political scientist in Rand Corporation specializing in the Middle East, Turkish authorities said Fuller attended a meeting in Istanbul on 15 July 2016 involving organization and coordination of the botched coup.Another American among the attendance, as stated by the Turkish prosecutors, was academic Henri Barkey who was named a suspect a week after the failed coup.\n\nThe U.S. consulate in Turkey issued an advisory to U.S. citizens to avoid the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey, which houses about 50 nuclear bombs, until ""normal operations have been restored"".They stated that local authorities were denying access to the air base and that power supplying the air base was shut off.\n\nThe Incirlik base is important to the U.S.-led effort in Syria to combat ISIL and other militants.Nearly 1,500 American personnel are housed in the base.\n\nTwenty-four hours after initial reports that the air base was shut down, United States defense department officials confirmed that the base and its airspace had re-opened to military aircraft and that operations by American aircraft will resume.The Turkish commander of the air base, brig.Gen. Bekir Ercan Van was arrested.After the failure of the coup Gen Bekir Ercan Van sought asylum from the U.S., but his request was denied by U.S.\n\nFollowing the failed coup attempt multiple media outlets have published editorials advocating the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Incirlik Air base as Turkey is unstable.\n\nOn 16 July, anti-coup protesters chanted against locals in areas of Istanbul with high concentration of Alevis, including Okmeydanı and Gazi.Such incidents also occurred in a quarter of Antakya with a high Alevi population, where a motorcyclist stating to be a sharia advocate was lynched.In a neighbourhood of Ankara, shops belonging to Syrians were attacked by a mob.In Malatya, Sunni Islamists harassed residents of an Alevi neighbourhood, particularly the women, and attempted to enter the neighbourhood en masse.Police intervened and blocked all roads leading there.In Kadıköy, people drinking alcohol in public were attacked by a group of religious fundamentalists.\n\nFollowing the arrests, thousands of anti-coup protesters demanded instituting the death penalty against detainees connected with the coup, chanting ""we want the death penalty"".President Erdoğan has been open to reinstituting the death penalty, noting that ""in a democracy, whatever the people want they will get.""Turkish authorities have not executed anyone since 1984, but legally abolished capital punishment only in 2004 as a pre-condition to join the European Union.\n\nEuropean Union officials have been vocal about their opposition to purges by Turkish authorities in connection to the coup.French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that Turkey must work within the framework of the law to uphold Europe\'s democratic principles.Furthermore, on 18 July 2016, Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of Foreign Affairs of the European Union, announced that no country will be admitted into the European Union ""if it introduces the death penalty"".Moreover, German press secretary, Steffen Seibert, stated that reinstituting the death penalty will end Turkey\'s accession talks with the European Union.\n\nTurkey is a member of the Council of Europe, and ratified the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) as part of its terms of membership.The ECHR is an international treaty that includes the abolition of the death penalty among its terms.As such, Turkey is legally bound not to reintroduce the death penalty.\n\nOn 20 July 2016, President Erdoğan announced a three-month state of emergency in response to the attempted coup, invoking Article 120 of the Constitution of Turkey (""Declaration of state of emergency because of widespread acts of violence and serious deterioration of public order"").Under the state of emergency, under Article 121, ""the Council of Ministers, meeting under the chairpersonship of the President of the Republic, may issue decrees having the force of law on matters necessitated by the state of emergency"", with decrees subject to subsequent parliamentary approval.The state of emergency was endorsed by the Parliament on 21 July by 346 votes to 115.The Justice and Development Party and the Nationalist Movement Party supported the state of emergency, whilst the Republican People\'s Party and the Peoples\' Democratic Party opposed it.Prime Minister Yıldırım said at the Parliament that the state of emergency was necessary to ""get rid of this scourge rapidly"".\n\nAs part of the state of emergency, deputy prime minister Kurtulmuş announced that Turkey was temporarily suspending part of the European Convention on Human Rights following the attempted coup, invoking Article 15 of the Convention (""war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation"").The suspensions must be notified to the Council of Europe and may not affect the right to a fair trial or the prohibition on torture.\n\nThis state of emergency in Turkey as well as the hindrance of the right to protest that occurred within such framework have been layered onto a longer history of emergency rules, oppressive legislation and daily government practice that have reinforced both.We can see from this the ""autocratisation"" process in Turkey has thrived of existing legal framework deeply associated in legacies of past ""emergencies"".\n\nOn 3 October 2016 Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş declared the governments intention to extend the state of emergency by a further three months raising objections from both the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) and Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) were critical of the governments use of their emergency powers and declared that they would vote against an extension.\n\nFollowing the National Security Council\'s recommendation for the extension President Erdoğan stated that it was possible that the state of emergency could last for longer than a year prompting outcry from the opposition, Leader of the Main Opposition Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu said that ""The president saying that the state of emergency can last longer than 12 months is strengthening the fear of a counter-coup"" and that it was ""raising the prospect of opportunist measures.""\n\nThe AKP\'s governmental majority allowed the three-month extension to take effect on 19 October 2016.The two-year-long state of emergency was ended on 19 July 2018.\n\nOn 16 July 2016, the media reported that eight Turkish military personnel of various ranks had landed in Greece\'s northeastern city of Alexandroupolis on board a Black Hawk helicopter and claimed political asylum in Greece.While the Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu demanded extradition of ""the eight traitors as soon as possible"", the Greek authorities stated: ""We will follow the procedures of international law.However, we give severe considerations to the fact that [the Turkish military men] are accused, in their own country, of violating the constitutional order and trying to overthrow democracy.""The helicopter was returned to Turkey shortly thereafter.The eight asylum seekers, their asylum case pending, were later transferred to Athens, mainly for safety reasons.On 26 January, the Supreme Court of Greece eventually ruled against their extradition, on the grounds that the eight were unlikely to face a fair trial if returned to their home country and due to concerns over their safety.\n\nOn 15 February 2017, five Turkish commandos illegally entered Greece through the Evros river.However, once they entered the country, the group split.The two of them surrendered to the police and on 20 February 2017, requested political asylum.They were being held in the city of Alexandroupolis.The two men belonged to the Turkish navy.The names given by the two reportedly match the names of two fugitives wanted in relation to the shadowy operation against Erdoğan himself.The Greek government mentioned that the Greek authorities will not allow the country to be dragged into the ongoing feud between the Turkish state and the followers of Gulen.But there were no sign of the other three.According to a lawyer there were indications that the other three have been arrested by Greek authorities who were about to expel them to Turkey.According to new evidence and new information these three ""arrested"" marines were delivered under fast and informal procedures from Greek to Turkish services.\n\nAfter the coup attempt, two Turkish military attachés in Athens, Staff Col. İlhan Yaşıtlı and naval attaché Col. Halis Tunç, had reportedly disappeared along with their families.The Greek foreign ministry canceled the two attachés\' accreditations on 7 August 2016, upon the request of the Turkish foreign ministry.Greek media reported that they might have fled to Italy.On 11 August 2016, the Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu confirmed the reports saying that they had left Greece for Italy on 6 August and adding that Turkey would officially ask the Italian authorities to extradite the two soldiers.\n\nOn 9 August 2016, the media reported that Turkey\'s Rear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been on a United States-based assignment for NATO and after the coup was subject to a detention order in Turkey, had sought asylum in the United States.\n\nIn mid-November 2016, it was officially confirmed that about 40 Turkish military servicemen of various ranks stationed at NATO command structures had applied for asylum in Germany and Belgium.\n\nIn January 2017, Der Spiegel magazine and ARD broadcaster reported that about 40 mostly high-ranking Turkish soldiers who worked at NATO facilities in Germany requested asylum in Germany.\n\nAt the end of February 2017, Germany said it had received 136 asylum requests from Turks holding diplomatic passports since the July coup attempt.The figure was a total for August 2016 to January 2017; some were presumed to be military officers posted to NATO bases in Germany.\n\nIn November 2016, NATO\'s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that Turkish NATO Officers had requested asylum in the countries where they had been posted.He did not name the nations involved or the number of officers, saying it was a matter for those countries to decide.He said: ""Some Turkish officers working in NATO command structure ... have requested asylum in the countries where they are working. ...As always, this is an issue that is going to be assessed and decided by the different NATO allies as a national issue.""\n\nAs of March 2017, Norway have granted asylum for four Turkish soldiers and a military attache.\n\nSeveral Turkish citizens with diplomatic passports have sought political asylum in Switzerland.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, detainees in Turkey have been denied access to legal counsel, have been beaten and tortured.They have not been provided with adequate food, water, or medical care.At least one has attempted suicide.Amnesty International wanted the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture to send people to check on detainees conditions.A person who had been on duty at the Ankara police headquarters said that police denied medical treatment to a detainee.""Let him die.We will say he came to us dead,"" the witness quoted a police doctor as saying.\n\nAlso, Erdoğan has extended the maximum period of detention for suspects from four days to 30, a move Amnesty said increased the risk of torture or other maltreatment of detainees.\n\nTurkish Justice Ministry denied the reports and the Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said on his Twitter account: ""There has not been any torture or assault of detainees in custody,"" in response to reports by Amnesty International.""The claims of torture and assault make up a pre-packaged misinformation campaign formed by members of FETÖ, one which is untrue and distorted,""\n\nOn 7 August, between three and five million people gathered for an anti-coup rally organized by the Turkish authorities in Istanbul.President Erdoğan and the two leaders of the major opposition parties (the Republican People\'s Party and the Nationalist Movement Party) were present.\n\nGreek authorities on several Aegean islands have called for emergency measures to curtail a growing flow of refugees from Turkey; the number of migrants and refugees willing to make the journey across the Aegean has increased noticeably after the failed coup.At Athens officials voiced worries because Turkish monitors overseeing the deal in Greece had been abruptly pulled out after the failed coup without being replaced.Also, the mayor of Kos expressed concern in a letter to the Greek Prime Minister citing the growing influx of refugees and migrants after the failed coup.The Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises (SETE) warned about the prospect of another flare-up in the refugee/migrant crisis due to the Turkish political instability.\n\nVincent Cochetel, the director of the Europe Bureau of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in August 2016 that parts of the EU-Turkey deal about immigration were already de facto suspended because no Turkish police were present at Greek detention centres to oversee deportations.\n\nOn 25 August 2016, seven Turkish citizens sought asylum in Greece.Two were university professors, and their two children applied for asylum in Alexandroupoli after they illegally entered the country from the northeastern border.Also, three businessmen illegally reached the Greek island of Rhodes, and they also applied for asylum.\n\nOn 30 August 2016, a Turkish judge arrived at the Greek island of Chios on a migrant boat, with six Syrian nationals, and sought asylum in the country.He told the Greek coastguard and police officers that he is being persecuted in Turkey for his political beliefs by President Tayyip Erdoğan.The Turkish judge had been arrested for illegally entering the country and was transferred to Athens for his asylum proceedings.The Syrian nationals claimed refugee status.\n\nOn 11 September 2016, four Turkish civilians were arrested by Turkish police.An academic and a teacher attempted to escape to Greece illegally by crossing the Evros river, and the other two because they organized the escape attempt.The academic and the teacher paid a total of 12,500 euros in Istanbul to arrange their escape to Greece.Before their attempt, both the academic and the teacher were suspended from their duties as part of the ongoing probe into the failed coup attempt.Police also seized an air raft, an oar and a pump while detaining the suspects.The court later ordered the two\'s release while the other two suspects, who organized the escape attempt, were arrested.\n\nOn 21 September 2016, ten Turkish civilians, two men, two women and six children landed by boat illegally on the Greek island of Rhodes and sought asylum.They told the Greek authorities they were working in the private sector in Turkey and the Turkish government was persecuting them due to their political beliefs.\n\nOn 29 September 2016, five Turkish nationals, a couple and their child and two other men, arrived in Greece, at Alexandroupolis by crossing the Evros River by boat illegally and requested political asylum.\n\nOn 12 December 2016, one female Turkish national, landed by boat, full of refugees and immigrants, illegally on the Greek island of Lesbos.She requested political asylum.\n\nOn 24 October 2017, Turkish authorities obtained information that 995 Turks have applied for asylum in Greece after the coup attempt.\n\nMore than 1,800 Turkish citizens requested asylum in Greece in 2017.\n\nOn 18 February 2018, seventeen Turkish nationals, including six children, requested asylum in Greece at Oinousses island.\n\nIn August 2018, the former lawmaker for the Peoples\' Democratic Party, Leyla Birlik, requested asylum in Greece after illegally crossing the border near Alexandroupolis.\n\nBerlin mayor, Michael Müller (SPD), said Turkey was waging war on supporters of the Gülen movement in Germany.He said that Turkish officials had approached him and asked him whether he would be prepared to confront the Gülen movement in Berlin critically and, if necessary, to support measures against it.The mayor rejected the idea and made it very clear that Turkish conflicts could not be waged in the city.\n\nDer Spiegel presented classified documents, which showed that Turkey\'s secret service (MIT) had asked Germany\'s foreign intelligence agency (BND) for help in rounding up Gülen supporters in Germany.The Turkish secret service wanted the BND to use its influence to spur German lawmakers into taking action against Gülen supporters and extraditing them to Turkey.Also, Turkey\'s government has sent German authorities requests for searches and extraditions linked to supporters of Fethullah Gülen in Germany.\n\nIn Germany businesses thought to be in support of the Gülen movement have been harassed by Erdoğan supporters.\n\nAfter the failed coup, there was a massive demonstration in Cologne at Germany, in late July, in support of Turkish President Erdoğan.Erdoğan wanted to address the participants via video but was rejected by the local authorities and the German Constitutional Court due to security concerns.Turkey said that the ban was unacceptable and a violation of freedom of expression.\n\nGerman authorities said Turkish mosques in Germany were playing Turkish politics and worried that Turkey\'s internal politics spilled over into German cities.For years, German authorities had encouraged Turkey\'s state-run religious institution Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs usually referred to as DİTİB to provide Islamic preachers and teachers and Gülen Movement Schools for the large Turkish diaspora in Germany.DİTİB manages some 900 mosques in Germany.Gülen movement runs 100 educational facilities in Germany.\n\nAfter the failed coup DİTİB published a sermon praising ""our noble nation"" for rising against ""a wretched network"" that had sown ""seeds of sedition, rebellion and hostility.""According to Volker Beck, a member of the center-left Greens in Germany\'s Bundestag, ""That was not a religious text.It was a declaration of obedience to Mr. Erdoğan and his measures since the coup attempt,"" Volker Kauder, parliamentary group leader of the Germany\'s ruling Christian Democrats, the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU)/Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) faction, said Turkish-Germans should be loyal to Germany first and foremost.\n\nGermans of Turkish origin are being pressured in Germany by informers and officers of Turkey\'s MIT spy agency.According to reports Turkey had 6,000 informants plus MIT officers in Germany who were putting pressure on ""German Turks"".Hans-Christian Ströbele said that there was an ""unbelievable"" level of ""secret activities"" in Germany by Turkey\'s MIT agency.According to Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, not even the former communist East German Stasi secret police had managed to run such a large ""army of agents"" in the former West Germany: ""Here, it\'s not just about intelligence gathering, but increasingly about intelligence service repression.""\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nGermany\'s Office for Migration and Refugees said on 18 November 2016, it had received 4,437 political asylum requests from Turkish citizens up to October, compared to 1,767 for the whole of last year.""We must expect that the number of Turks who are seeking political asylum in Germany will continue to rise,"" said Stephan Mayer, the domestic policy speaker of the union coalition in the Bundestag.\n\nOn 10 December 2016, eleven Turkish nationals, 10 adults and one child, in a martial arts group have applied for asylum in Germany.\n\nAs of January 2018, Germany was first place and Greece second as EU destinations of choice for Turkish nationals requesting asylum after the coup attempt.\n\nTurkish police have carried out simultaneous raids in 18 cities against companies associated with United States-based Fethullah Gülen.The state-run Anadolu Agency said police searched 204 premises and detained 187 businessmen for ""membership in a terror organization"" and ""providing financial support to a terror organization"".All suspects\' assets were seized.\n\nWikiLeaks released Turkish emails and documents to respond to the Turkish government\'s purges that followed the coup attempt.In turn, the Turkish Telecommunications Communications Board blocked access to the WikiLeaks website.On 17 July 2016 Wikileaks had announced on Twitter, the leak of approximately 300,000 emails and over 500,000 documents, including those to and from AKP.\n\nWikiLeaks stated that it was attacked shortly after 17 July announcement of the planned publication and hypothesized that Turkish authorities were responsible.WikiLeaks stated in a tweet, ""our infrastructure is under sustained attack.""Tweets from WikiLeaks include ""We are unsure of the true origin of the attack.The timing suggests a Turkish state power faction or its allies.We will prevail & publish.""and: ""Turks will likely be censored to prevent them reading our pending release of 100k+ docs on politics leading up to the coup."", ""We ask that Turks are ready with censorship bypassing systems such as TorBrowser and uTorrent""; ""And that everyone else is ready to help them bypass censorship and push our links through the censorship to come.""\n\nUpon the release of the email dump, it has been reported that the emails contain little to no damning information, and instead are just mails from a public mailing list, but also linked externally to ""voter information on all of the women registered to vote in 78 out of Turkey\'s 81 provinces"".\n\nSeveral places were renamed to commemorate the failed coup: Boğaziçi Köprüsü (Bosphorus Bridge) → 15 Temmuz Şehitler Köprüsü Kızılay Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Kızılay Demokrasi Meydanı Ahmet Taner Kışlalı Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Milli İrade Meydanı (Reverted to original name a few days later) Büyük İstanbul Otogarı → İstanbul 15 Temmuz Demokrasi Otogarı In TRT, Yeni Haber Stüdyosu → 15 Temmuz Millet Stüdyosu Kazan → Kahramankazan about the province\'s local people\'s resistance to the coup plotters.Kahraman means ""hero"" in Turkish Niğde University → Niğde Ömer Halisdemir University\n\nIn 2018, the Istanbul Municipal Council decided to change the names of a total of 90 streets that included words which could be associated with FETÖ.\n\nThe Presidency of Religious Affairs stated that it would not be providing religious funeral services to the dead coupists, except for ""privates and low-ranking officers compelled by force and threats who found themselves in the midst of the conflict without full knowledge of anything"".\n\nA document dated 26 September 2016 showed that Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) asked Turkish missions and religious representatives abroad to profile Gülen movement expatriates living in their respective foreign countries.Gülen-linked schools, businesses, foundations, associations, media outlets and others were also included in the reports.Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs has gathered intelligence via imams from 38 countries.\n\nBelgium officials said they would withdraw recognition of Diyanet mosques in the country if necessary.\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nOn 21 December 2016, the Turkish government has recalled Yusuf Acar, the religious affairs attaché of the Turkish Embassy in the Netherlands, after Dutch authorities said he was spying.Acar collected information of people who sympathize with Fethullah Gülen at Netherlands and passed it on to the Turkish authorities.The Dutch government called spying activities an ""unwanted and non-acceptable interference in the lives of Dutch citizens.""and the attaché was reportedly declared persona non grata and received a ""deportation warning"" by Dutch authorities.\n\nOn 26 January 2017, President Erdoğan, during his visit to Tanzania, asked his Tanzanian counterpart John Magufuli to take action against the network of Fethullah Gülen.\n\nIn April 2017 it was announced that President Erdoğan planned to establish a purpose-built museum dedicated to the coup events, called the ""Museum of the 15 July: Martyrs and Democracy"", to be located in Kahramankazan, a town near Ankara.Paid for by Turkish Ministry of Culture funds, it is planned to open at the end of 2018.The museum opened in December 2019\n\nAmong the Turkish opposition parties, the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) issued a statement expressing their public opposition to the coup, and the Hürriyet Daily News reported that Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bahçeli telephoned Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım to express his opposition to the coup.The co-chairs of the opposition Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) issued a statement saying that the party was ""under all circumstances and as a matter of principle against all kinds of coup.""Amongst the minor parties, left-wing nationalist Patriotic Party\'s Doğu Perinçek backed democracy, when he held Gülen and the Americans responsible.Kurdish militant separatist organization Kurdistan Workers\' Party, which Turkey and its allies label as a terrorist organization, urged their supporters to stay away from the coup and rather defend their people, while the Communist Party called upon the people to overthrow the AKP government which they called an ""enemy of humanity"".\n\nDuring the first hours of the coup plotters\' moves of blocking Istanbul\'s bridges and flying fighter jets low over Istanbul and Ankara, Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjørn Jagland tweeted against the coup attempt and underlined that ""any attempt to overthrow the democratically elected leaders is unacceptable"".\n\nRussia\'s President Vladimir Putin called Erdoğan out of solidarity before all NATO member countries\' heads following the coup attempt.Erdoğan thanked the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev – who was the first president to show solidarity after the coup attempt – for his support in solving the 7-month crisis over downed Russian Sukhoi Su-24 and the Prime Minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, who was among the first NATO country leaders to condemn the coup attempt, already from the early hours of Saturday.\n\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the then prime minister of Pakistan, was all praise for the people of Turkey and the AKP government and strongly condemned what he termed as an attempt to undermine democracy in Turkey.""We deeply admire the resolve of the brave and resilient Turkish people, who stood up against the forces of darkness and anarchy to express their support and commitment to democracy,"" the PM said in a statement issued from his office.\n\nThe majority of countries either expressed their support for the government or called for restraint.On 16 July 2016, however, a proposed United Nations Security Council statement denouncing the coup was not accepted by Egypt, a non-permanent member of the Council at the time, due to textual disagreements.Egyptian diplomats said that the council is ""in no position to qualify, or label [the Turkish] government – or any other government for that matter – as democratically elected or not"".Objection by the United States and the UK – permanent members of the Security Council – led to Egypt proposing a new statement calling for all sides to ""respect the democratic and constitutional principles and the rule of law"", which was rejected, preventing the condemnation of the coup attempt by the Security Council.The leader of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky supported the coup attempt.\n\nAl-Monitor reported that ""Unlike Ankara\'s Western allies, Iran did not wait for the coup\'s failure to speak up.Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif voiced support for democracy in a Twitter message in the early hours of the unrest, writing ""Stability, and democracy in Turkey are paramount"".In a subsequent phone call after the failure of the coup attempt, President Hassan Rouhani told Erdoğan the coup attempt was ""a test to identify your domestic and foreign friends and enemies.""An Iranian official pointed out parallels between the coup attempt in Turkey and the coup against Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mussadiq in 1953: ""What we know is that this attempt was triggered by foreign hands.We have experienced the same thing in the past.Since Mr. Erdogan wants to play a more positive path in the region today, they want to overthrow him.""\n\nMustafa Akıncı, President of Northern Cyprus, welcomed the fact that ""no community in Turkey ... applauded the coup as they have done in the past.""Azerbaijan strongly condemned the attempted military coup in Turkey and considered such actions unacceptable according to a statement from Novruz Mammadov, deputy head of the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration and chief of the foreign relations department.\n\nEuropean Commissioner dealing with Turkey\'s EU membership bid, Johannes Hahn, said it appears Turkey\'s government prepared arrest lists of political opponents before the coup attempt and had been waiting for the right time to act.In this sense, EU reported that as a main criticism to put this issue in the category of terrorism become the violation of the fundamental rights and fundamental values of the citizens.Hence, it underlines a total divergence of opinions and mentality between EU and Turkey which reached a deadlock here especially after the 15th of July in 2016.\n\nOn 19 July 2016, White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said during a press briefing that President Barack Obama has held a phone conversation with President Erdoğan: ""The President used the phone call to reiterate once again the strong commitment of the United States to the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey.The President pledged any needed assistance to the Turkish government as they conduct an investigation to determine exactly what happened.""\n\nOn 20 July 2016, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""Turkey has a large armed force, professional armed forces and ...I am certain they will continue as a committed and strong NATO ally.""On a statement released on 10 August 2016, the Secretary General once more strongly condemned the attempted coup and reiterated full support for Turkey\'s democratic institutions.He also expressed support for the elected Turkish government and respect for the courage of the Turkish people for resisting the coup plotters.\n\nOn 29 July 2016, the commander of U.S. Central Command, General Joseph Votel, denied statements by Turkey\'s president Erdoğan that he has supported the coup attempt in Turkey.\n\nOn 1 August 2016, United States Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, General Joseph Dunford, visited Turkey and condemned the coup attempt.Dunford said: ""The consistent theme throughout the day was a reaffirmation of the importance of the U.S.-Turkey relationship – the need for us to cooperate.""\n\nOn July, 20, there were reports that a group of Turkish military commandos coup fugitives would try to cross from Turkey to the island of Symi, in the southeastern Aegean, at Greece.The Hellenic Coast Guard was on alert and increased the patrols in the area, especially after a group of inflatable dinghies and other vessels were seen departing from Datça, on the Turkish coast, in the direction of Symi, they monitored the movements of the Turkish vessels, which remained in Turkish waters.Furthermore, a contingent of the Hellenic Police was dispatched to Symi to conduct checks there.The Greek government had been anticipating a possible attempt by participants in the failed coup to come to Greece and took the reports seriously.Turkish F-16 fighter jets were also scrambled to check reports that missing Turkish coast guard vessels had appeared in Greek waters in the Aegean.Later on the day, the Turkish interior ministry denied reports that rebel soldiers might have ""hijacked"" a vessel to flee to Greece.The Greek armed forces remained on alert the throughout the day for potential coup fugitives.\n\nAccording to Michael Rubin, from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Erdoğan had himself to blame for the coup.Following an increasingly Islamist agenda, Erdoğan had reportedly ""dropped any pretense of governing for all Turks.""After ""fanning the flames"" at the 2013 Gezi Park protests, he transformed the predominantly Kurdish-inhabited areas of southeastern Turkey ""into a war zone reminiscent of the worst days of the 1980s.""The biggest problem, according to Rubin, might have been Erdoğan\'s foreign policy, which managed to turn the initial ""no problems with neighbors"" doctrine into a situation where the country has problems with almost every neighbor and has even alienated some of its allies and friends.Rubin previously worked as an official at the Pentagon and less than 4 months before the coup, he wrote an article in Newsweek magazine titled, ""Will There Be a Coup Against Erdogan in Turkey?""\n\nBritish Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk warned that ""too late did Erdoğan realize the cost of the role he had chosen for his country.It\'s one thing to say sorry to Putin and patch up relations with Netanyahu; but when you can no longer trust your army, there are more serious matters to concentrate upon.""Even if this coup may have failed, Fisk expected another to follow in the months or years to come.\n\nTurkish professor Akın Ünver described the coup d\'état attempt as ""more of a mutiny"".\n\nThe name of the ""Peace at Home Council"" – Yurtta Sulh Konseyi – is derived from Atatürk\'s famous saying \'Peace at Home, Peace in the World\'.Journalist Ezgi Başaran said that ""the statement of the junta, that was [...] read on the [...] government TV [channel] as the coup got under way, bore a strong resemblance to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk\'s famous address to the Turkish Youth.[...] On the other hand, given that these references are too obvious, they may have been intentionally included to insinuate a Kemalist junta rather than a Gülenist one.""\n\nThe citizen journalism site Bellingcat published an analysis of the messages of a WhatsApp group consisting of high-ranking military officials who had taken part in the coup covering their activities including them killing several people.The messages were cross referenced with video footage.The group was named ""Yurtta sulh"" which refers to a peace at home speech and they seem secular and military with no references to Gülen or anything related during the several hours of messaging.\n\nNews reports have suggested that the coup ringleader was Adil Öksüz.Some believe Öksüz to have been an operative with Turkish intelligence.\n\nGerman Islamic studies scholar said the putschists tried to forestall a large-scale purge of judiciary and military, the implementation of which had already started on Saturday, the day after the coup attempt.According to Turkish investigative journalist Ahmet Şık, a list of officials to be purged had been ready compiled by the attorney-general of Izmir, Okan Bato, and was approved by President Erdoğan.According to this version, the putschists had to quickly bring forward their coup attempt before being disposed and arrested.\n\nDuring and after the events, several politicians and commentators suggested that the government knew about the coup in advance and possibly directed it.The facts that the coup attempt began in the evening rather than at a more inconspicuous time and that the events were largely confined to Ankara and Istanbul contributed to doubts about the authenticity of the coup attempt.Journalists and opposition politicians branded it a \'tragic comedy\' and \'theatre play\'.Advocates of such theories pointed to how Erdoğan stood to gain from the coup attempt in terms of increasing his popularity and support for his calls for an executive presidency, while being able to legitimize further crackdowns on judicial independence and the opposition in general.\n\nOther elements that were reported to support the theory included: no list of demands by the coup plotters, the organization and response of the police, the long lists of arrests that seemed to be ready surprisingly quickly (including arrests of 2,745 judges and 2,839 soldiers), and the obvious nature of the coup actions.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom Erdoğan had said as being one of the principal conspirators, commented, ""I don\'t believe that the world believes the accusations made by President Erdoğan.There is a possibility that it could be a staged coup and it could be meant for further accusations [against the Gülenists].""Journalist Cengiz Çandar, a veteran observer of Turkey\'s coups, said ""I have never seen any with this magnitude of such inexplicable sloppiness.""Prominent Hizmet (Gülen movement) spokesman Alp Aslandogan said, referencing that the Turkish Air Force commander met with Erdoğan before 15 July, that certain legal documentation related to the coup seemed written beforehand, arguing that within ""the indictment written by a prosecutor on the night of 15 July to 16 July, there were events there that didn\'t actually happen.Some events did happen, but those events didn\'t happen by the time the document started.It looks like a bigger plan was there, and part of the plan did not come to pass.""\n\nThe organization and spontaneous synchronization by large numbers of mosques was perceived to be unachievable unless there had been prior preparation, with journalists also pointing to how Erdoğan could have strategically used the call to prayer to invoke religious sentiment in a political situation as a veiled attack on state secularism.\n\nThousands of arrests and purges were conducted by Turkish authorities between 16 and 18 July 2016.The sheer number of these arrests made at such a speed could only be done so if the ""Turkish government had all those lists ready"", as suggested by Johannes Hahn, European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, on 18 July 2016.Hahn also said that because these lists were already available immediately after the coup, the ""event was prepared"" and the lists were to be used ""at a certain stage"".\n\nMehmet Dişli, who was seen giving orders to the coup plotters and who was the one who put a belt around Hulusi Akar\'s neck to make him sign, is the brother of Şaban Dişli, a former vice president of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and confidant of Erdoğan.\n\nSeveral social media users have compared the coup attempt to the Reichstag fire in 1933, which Adolf Hitler used as an excuse to suspend civil liberties and order mass arrests of his opponents.Politico correspondent Ryan Heath said that ""the coup was staged to allow Erdoğan to purge the military of opponents and increase his grip on the country"".Heath used Twitter to share comments from his Turkish source, who called the events of Friday night a ""fake coup"" which would help a ""fake democracy warrior"" (referring to Erdoğan).The source said: ""Probably we\'ll see an early election [in] which he\'ll try to guarantee an unbelievable majority of the votes.And this will probably guarantee another 10–15 years of authoritarian, elected dictatorship.""\n\nThe New York Times reported that some Turkish citizens believed the coup attempt was staged by Erdoğan to improve his public image and popularity, while cracking down on political opponents and expanding his power.Critics found it suspect that reportedly no government officials were arrested or harmed during the attempted coup, which—among other factors—raised the suspicion of a false flag event staged by the Turkish government to crack down on opposition parties.Those in Turkey suggesting that the coup was staged are also being questioned by the government.\n\nPoliticians and journalists who were skeptical of the authenticity of the coup plot said that in reality, a \'civil coup\' had effectively been staged against the Armed Forces and Judiciary, both of which were extensively purged of stated Gülen supporters by the government shortly after the events.Skeptics said that the coup would be used as an excuse for further erosion of judicial independence and a crackdown on the opposition, giving the AKP greater and unstoppable power over all state institutions and paving the way for a more radical Islamist agenda at odds with the founding principles of the Turkish Republic.\n\nJustice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said in late July 2016 that Turkish social media users who said the government was staging the coup faced investigation: ""Just look at the people who are saying on social media that this was theatre.Public prosecutors are already investigating them.Most of them are losers who think it is an honor to die for Fethullah Gülen\'s command.""\n\nOn 12 July 2017, Stockholm Center for Freedom, a monitoring group with reported links to the Gülen movement, published a controversial report stating that President Erdogan orchestrated the coup bid as a false flag to consolidate his powers, set up his opposition for a mass persecution, and push Turkish Armed Forces into a military incursion into Syria.According to the report, it uncovered new evidence from 11 July 2016, four days before the planned coup bid, that a secret plan was circulated among select group of Armed Forces to give an appearance of a coup attempt.The plan was sanctioned by intelligence and military chiefs with the approval of Erdogan.\n\nIn early November 2017, Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for , former Director of the Middle East Program of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, stating that he is an agent of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), that he was present in Istanbul during the 2016 Turkish coup attempt, and that he was one of the key organizers behind the coup attempt.Around 1 December, the Istanbul prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for Graham E.

115,"{'Wiki_Title': '2016 Turkish coup attempt', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'On 15 July 2016, a faction within the Turkish Armed Forces, organized as the Peace at Home Council, attempted a coup d\'état against state institutions, including the government and president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.They attempted to seize control of several places in Ankara, Istanbul, Marmaris and elsewhere, such as the Asian side entrance of the Bosphorus Bridge, but failed to do so after forces and civilians loyal to the state defeated them.The Council cited an erosion of secularism, elimination of democratic rule, disregard for human rights, and Turkey\'s loss of credibility in the international arena as reasons for the coup.The government said it had evidence the coup leaders were linked to the Gülen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the Republic of Turkey and led by Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish businessman and a well-known Islamic scholar who lives in exile in Pennsylvania.The Turkish government alleged that Gülen was behind the coup (which Gülen denied) and that the United States was harboring him.Events surrounding the coup attempt and the purges in its aftermath reflect a complex power struggle between Islamist elites in Turkey.\n\nDuring the coup attempt, over 300 people were killed and more than 2,100 were injured.Many government buildings, including the Turkish Parliament and the Presidential Palace, were bombed from the air.Mass arrests followed, with at least 40,000 detained, including at least 10,000 soldiers and 2,745 judges, for being affiliated with the coup attempt.15,000 education staff were also suspended and the licenses of 21,000 teachers working at private institutions were revoked after the government stated they were loyal to Gülen.More than 77,000 people have been arrested and over 160,000 fired from their jobs, on reports of connections to Gülen.\n\nThere were many reactions against the coup attempt, both domestically and internationally.The main opposition parties in Turkey condemned the attempt, while several international leaders—such as those of the United States, NATO, the European Union, and neighboring countries—called for ""respect of the democratic institutions in Turkey and its elected officials.""Many international organizations also opposed the coup.The United Nations Security Council, however, did not denounce the coup after disagreements over the phrasing of a statement.Iran opposed the coup and advised Erdogan to defeat the coup plotters.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the head of United States Central Command, General Joseph Votel, was ""siding with coup plotters"", after Votel criticized the Turkish government for arresting the Pentagon\'s contacts in Turkey.\n\nIn March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.The same month, the British Parliament\'s Foreign Affairs Select Committee said some Gulenists were involved in the coup d\'état attempt but found no hard evidence that Fethullah Gülen masterminded the failed coup and found no evidence to justify the United Kingdom designating the Gülen movement as a ""terrorist organization"".\n\nSince the 1970s, followers of the influential cleric Fethullah Gülen had assumed increasingly important positions within the Turkish state apparatus.Gülen several times advised his followers to take key positions in society and government, if necessary with a secret identity to avoid opposition from the laicistic Turkish army and government.Nevertheless, at the start of the 21st century, Gülen\'s followers achieved crucial positions of power in Turkey (and beyond) with a vast network of newspapers, TV channels, schools, associations, lobby organizations, financial institutions and positions within the state such as the army and the judiciary.Initially, the then Prime Minister Erdogan seemingly tolerated the power of the Gülen movement because of common interests such as limiting the undemocratic political power of the military, but also because of impotence and fear of Gülen\'s power within Turkey.\n\nA series of events eventually led to a rift between Erdogan and Gülen.For example, prosecutors that allegedly were aligned with the Gülen movement tried to arrest the intelligence chief Hakan Fidan for the peace negotiations with the PKK, and by extension PM Erdogan subsequently, as the Turkish secret service is directly subordinate to the prime minister of Turkey.During this period (2010-2013), state secrets were leaked, fraud was committed with the entrance exams for government employees (KPSS), a change of power occurred at the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) and (sex)tapes of both government members and opposition members were leaked.Following these events and other incidents, the Turkish government decided to designate the Gülen movement as parallel state and FETÖ (Fethullahist Terror Organization).Alleged Gülen supporters were fired or arrested.The coup attempt that followed is therefore also described by some analysts as a last desperate attempt by Gülenists to retain power.\n\nIt is widely reported that Kemalist ideology played a huge role in motivating the 15 July 2016 coup attempt, like all previous political interventions in the history of Turkey\'s military coups.Since the establishment of multiparty democracy in Turkey in 1946, the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), together with the judiciary, have viewed themselves as guardians of Kemalist ideals and the secular Turkish nationalist state established under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk against political parties that have promoted a larger role for Islam and minorities in public life.The military and judiciary have regularly intervened in politics to block or ban popular parties representing conservative Muslim Turks, attempting to relax the restrictions on traditional religious practices, such as women\'s wearing of headscarves.The military has toppled four elected governments: by coups in 1960 and 1980, and by military decisions in 1971 and 1997.The military has also banned several major political parties.In 1998, Erdoğan, then-mayor of Istanbul, was banned for life from politics and jailed because he had read a religious poem by Ziya Gökalp several years before, at a public meeting.In 2007, the military expressed its opposition to the election of Abdullah Gül, of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), as president, by issuing an e-memorandum.Still, Gül was eventually elected when the AKP won both a referendum on the matter.Also, a snap election, and the party returned with a larger majority in the parliament.The military cited erosion of secularism as one of the reasons for the coup in the statement published on the day of the coup.\n\nAs opposed to previous political interventions by the Turkish military, Turkey\'s AKP government and pro-state media maintain that the 15 July 2016 coup attempt was not motivated by allegiance to Kemalist ideology, but rather to the vast political, economic, and religious network led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen.Between 2007 and 2012, high-profile Kemalists, including high-ranking officers of the Turkish Armed Forces, faced a series of trials and purges, under reports of involvement in a secret society codenamed ""Ergenekon.""Supported by Islamist (both pro-Gülen and pro-Erdoğan) prosecutors, security officials, and media, the purges allowed lower-rank Islamist officers to assume high-ranking military positions.They were seen as a bid by Turkey\'s civilian leaders under President Erdoğan to establish dominance over the military.In these trials in 2013 – viewed as ""sensational"" and ""one of the biggest in recent Turkish history"" – 275 people, including senior military officers, journalists, lawyers, and academics, were said to be involved in the so-called ""Ergenekon"" conspiracy, reportedly plotting a coup in 2003/04 against then–Prime Minister Erdoğan.Additionally, some military officers were said to be involved in a separate reported plot, Sledgehammer.Simultaneously, Erdoğan promoted lower-ranking officers up the chain of command, ensuring that the military chief of staff was loyal to him and thereby demoralizing the army.\n\nThe AKP\'s alliance with Gülen started to collapse during 2013 as Gülenists targeted the AKP using corruption charges.After the split, Erdoğan decided it would be advantageous to rehabilitate the army.The ""Ergenekon"" convictions were overturned in April 2016 by the Court of Cassation, which ruled that the existence of the network was unproven.\n\nIn 2013, law enforcement efforts to fight corruption, which had led to the 2013 corruption scandal in Turkey, were faulted by Erdoğan.The anti-corruption efforts were a source of tension between the Gülenists and the AKP.In political analysis in the months prior to the coup attempt, the incidence of corruption was reported to be ""rife"" in Turkey.Following the coup attempt, some coup leaders cited corruption as a reason for their actions.\n\nOn 13 July, less than two days before the coup was launched, Erdoğan signed a bill giving Turkish soldiers immunity from prosecution while taking part in domestic operations.The bill requires cases against commanders to be approved by the prime minister, while district governors may sign cases against lower-ranking soldiers.The immunity bill was seen as part of the détente between the government and the armed forces.The latter has increasingly been taking over military operations in Kurdish-inhabited areas from police and paramilitary units.\n\nOn 15 July 2016, as reported just before 23:00 EEST (UTC+3), military jets were spotted flying over Ankara, and both the Fatih Sultan Mehmet and Bosphorus bridges in Istanbul were closed.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said military action was being ""taken outside the chain of command"" and it was an ""illegal attempt"" to seize power by ""part of the military"".He further said that those involved ""will pay the highest price.""Local media also reported tanks in Istanbul\'s Atatürk Airport.It was reported that Internet users within Turkey were blocked from accessing Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.Twitter later stated that it had ""no reason to think we\'ve been fully blocked"".Some hostages were taken at military headquarters, including the Turkish Chief of the General Staff Hulusi Akar.At around 21:00, the coupists had invited Salih Zeki Çolak, the commander of the Turkish Land Forces to the military headquarters.When he arrived, he was immediately apprehended.Abidin Ünal, head of the Turkish Air Force, who had been attending a wedding in Istanbul, was abducted from there by soldiers who descended from a helicopter.The coupists then tried to force Akar to sign the coup declaration, almost strangling him using a belt in the process.He refused and was then taken to the Akıncı Air Base and other commanders at the headquarters.The military also entered the Justice and Development Party\'s offices in Istanbul and asked people to leave.\n\nEarly reports said President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was safe in Marmaris, south-west Turkey, where he had been on holiday.\n\nFrom around 23:00 to midnight, helicopters bombed the police special forces headquarters and police air force headquarters in Gölbaşı, just outside of Ankara.The attacks left 42 dead and 43 injured.Türksat headquarters in Gölbaşı was also attacked, killing two security personnel.\n\nAt around 23:50, soldiers occupied Taksim Square in central Istanbul.\n\nAt 00:02, it was reported by Reuters that soldiers were inside the buildings of the state broadcaster, the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), in Ankara.During the coup attempt, soldiers forced anchor Tijen Karaş to read out a statement saying that ""the democratic and secular rule of law has been eroded by the current government"" and that Turkey was now led by the Peace at Home Council who would ""ensure the safety of the population.""The statement read in part: ""Turkish Armed Forces have completely taken over the administration of the country to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedoms, the rule of law and general security that was damaged.[...] All international agreements are still valid.We hope that all of our good relationships with all countries will continue.""The plotters said they had ""done so to preserve democratic order, and that the rule of law must remain a priority"".The statement also ordered temporary martial law (sıkıyönetim), and said a new constitution would be prepared ""as soon as possible"".TRT was then taken off air.\n\nOther media outlets were also raided by the putschists, such as Turkish newspaper Hürriyet and private broadcaster CNN Türk.\n\nReuters reported on 15 July that an EU source described the coup as ""well orchestrated,"" and predicted that ""given the scale of the operation, it is difficult to imagine they will stop short of prevailing.""Another EU diplomat said that the Turkish ambassador in his capital was shocked and ""taking it very seriously"".\n\nThe Peace at Home Council was reportedly chaired by Muharrem Köse.\n\nAdana: Upon receiving the intelligence that thirty soldiers from the 10th Air Base Command would move to the base where the regional and provincial gendarmerie commands were located, the police prevented the soldiers from leaving the guardhouse with TOMA and armored vehicles and blocked them.Bitlis: In the Tatvan district of Bitlis, on the orders of Brigade Commander Arif Seddar Afşar, helicopters were circulated in the skies of Tatvan and fired at the city.The brigade command left the municipality\'s construction equipment in front of the barracks in case there was a tank operation in the district.Denizli: Approximately five hundred officers and non-commissioned officers who participated in the coup attempt surrendered to the gendarmerie and police forces.They were interrogated at Çardak District Gendarme Command.Kars: With the order of Kars 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, the soldiers who came with tanks and armored personnel carriers surrounded the Police Headquarters building and wanted to detain Faruk Karaduman, the chief of police.At the same hours, the invitation of Deputy Governors, 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, went to the command.Kocaeli: Turkcell\'s data center in Gebze was raided by soldiers who participated in the coup attempt.Soldiers who tried to interrupt the internet service were detained.Malatya: A rebellious soldier opened fire inside a base of the Turkish 2nd Army, damaging six vehicles.The base was besieged by police and loyal soldiers, and the shooter was captured.Marmaris: Three military helicopters carried out a bomb attack on the hotel where Erdoğan was staying.Forty rebellious soldiers of the Special Forces Command clashed with the police in the region.Mersin: Mersin Garrison and Mediterranean Region Commander Admiral Nejat Atilla Demirhan called Mersin Provincial Police Deputy Chief Yakup Usta and Gendarmerie Colonel Mustafa Bakçepınar and stated that the Turkish Armed Forces had taken over the administration.He introduced himself as the martial law garrison commander and ordered Mersin Governor Özdemir Çakacak and district governors to be taken into custody.Demirhan and Dağdelen, who made the same announcement with the police radio obtained from Mersin Police Department, were detained through the operation of the security forces.Sakarya: Sakarya Governorship was captured with armored personnel carriers, military trucks and many military jeeps from the military unit in the Kandıra district of Kocaeli.As a reinforcement, two military vehicles full of soldiers from the Sakarya central division command had to return to their barracks in the face of the resistance of the police and the harsh reaction of the people who took to the streets against the putschists.The vehicles occupying the Sakarya Governorate were seized by the citizens and the soldiers in them were neutralized and handed over to the security forces.Afterwards, citizens and security forces entered the governor\'s office and neutralized the soldiers there and suppressed the uprising in the province.Eight civilian citizens were injured as a result of the fire opened by the military during the incident.Şırnak: Çakırsöğüt Gendarmerie Commando Brigadier General Ali Osman Gürcan and 309 soldiers, that participated in the coup attempt, were detained by the security forces.\n\nTurkey\'s Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım responded to the events by stating that an ""illegal action is taking place outside of the chain of command"".He also said that ""the government elected by the people remains in charge and this government will only go when the people say so.""The Turkish Presidential office said President Erdoğan was on holiday inside Turkey and condemned the coup attempt as an attack on democracy.A presidential source also said Erdoğan and his government were still in power.The first messages from Erdoğan were transmitted at around 00:23At about 01:00, Erdoğan did a FaceTime interview with CNN Türk, in which he called upon his supporters to take to the streets in defiance of the military-imposed curfew, saying ""There is no power higher than the power of the people.Let them do what they will at the public squares and airports.""Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş appeared on live television, saying Turkey\'s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is still in charge of the government.The mayor of Ankara, Melih Gökçek of the AKP, encouraged people to go out to the city\'s streets in defiance, despite a curfew imposed by the military.Erdoğan\'s plane took off from Dalaman Airport near Marmaris at 23:47, but had to wait in the air south of Atatürk for the airport to be secured.His plane landed at 02:50\n\nThe First Army General Command in Istanbul stated in a news conference that the TSK did not support the coup and the perpetrators represented a tiny faction that were on the verge of being brought under control.Istanbul Atatürk Airport was closed; all flights from the airport were cancelled.There was an explosion in the TRT broadcasting headquarters and gunfire was reported in Ankara.Soon after, it was stormed by a crowd of civilians and police, with four soldiers inside reportedly being ""neutralized"".The channel went back on air and Karaş, who had previously announced the coup, said live that she had been held hostage and forced to read the declaration of the coup at gunpoint.\n\nBy 01:00, it was reported that the military had pulled its forces from the Atatürk airport and people were coming inside, but by 01:13, it was reported that tanks were inside the airport and gunfire was heard.\n\nTanks opened fire near the Turkish Parliament Building.The parliamentary building was also hit from the air.Injuries were reported among protesters following gunfire on Bosphorus Bridge.\n\nA helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was shot down by a Turkish military F-16 fighter jet.There were also reports of pro-state jets flying over Ankara to ""neutralize"" helicopters used by those behind the coup.\n\nAt 03:08, a military helicopter opened fire on the Turkish parliament.At 03:10, Turkish Armed Forces stated on their website that they had complete control over the country.At 03:12, Yıldırım made a statement saying that the situation was under control and that a no-fly zone was declared over Ankara and that military planes that still flew would be shot down.\n\nIt was reported that the Turkish parliament had been bombed again at 03:23 and 03:33.A helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was also seen flying by it.Half an hour following the report of 12 deaths and 2 injuries in the parliament, soldiers entered CNN Türk\'s headquarters and forced the studio to go off air.After an hour of interruption by the pro-coup soldiers, CNN Türk resumed its broadcast.Later, İsmail Kahraman said a bomb exploded at a corner of the public relations building inside the parliament, with no deaths but several injuries among police officers.\n\nAt around 04:00 two or three helicopters attacked Erdogan\'s hotel.According to eyewitness accounts, ten to fifteen heavily armed men landed and started firing.In the ensuing conflict, two policemen were killed and 8 were injured.\n\nThe Doğan News Agency reported that in Istanbul several individuals were injured after soldiers fired on a group of people attempting to cross the Bosphorus Bridge in protest of the attempted coup.\n\nOn Saturday 16 July 2016, at 00:42 EEST (UTC+3), a Turkish Black Hawk helicopter sent a distress signal and requested permission from Greek authorities for an emergency landing, and landed eight minutes later (00:50) at the Dimokritos airport in Alexandroupoli, in Greece, while two Greek F-16s observed the procedure and escorted it to the airport.The first reports said that the passengers were seven military personnel and a civilian.Later, it turned out that all were military personnel (two majors, four captains and two non-commissioned officers).They had removed the badges and insignia from their uniforms, making it impossible to know their rank.All were arrested after landing for illegal entry into the country.They were transferred to the local police station, while the Greek authorities at the airport guarded the helicopter.The eight passengers all requested political asylum in Greece as they believed they would not get a fair trial in Turkey.On 21 September 2016, Greece denied three out of the eight asylum.The men\'s lawyer Stavroula Tomara said they would be appealing the decision and said they had the ""impression that the decision has been predetermined, and that the interview was conducted just as a formality.""On 11 October 2016, four more of the eight were denied asylum.Two of the men who had previously been denied asylum applied for a re-evaluation but their applications were also rejected.\n\nAfter Erdoğan flew into Istanbul, he made a televised speech inside the airport at around 04:00, whilst thousands gathered outside.He addressed a crowd of supporters in the airport, at about 06:30 He said, ""In Turkey, armed forces are not governing the state or leading the state.They cannot.""He blamed ""those in Pennsylvania"" (a reference to Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, and his Hizmet Movement) for the coup attempt.Erdoğan also said he had plans to ""clean up"" the army, saying that ""This uprising is a gift from God to us.""State-run Anadolu Agency named former Colonel Muharrem Köse, who in March 2016 was dishonorably discharged for reported association with Gülen, as the suspected leader of the coup.However, the Alliance for Shared Values, a non-profit organization associated with Gülen, released a statement reiterating that it condemns any military intervention in domestic politics, and saying Erdoğan\'s allegations against the movement were ""highly irresponsible"".Gülen himself said in a brief statement just before midnight: ""As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nReuters reported that in early hours of 16 July, the coup appeared to have ""crumbled"" as crowds defied pro-coup military orders and gathered in major squares of Istanbul and Ankara to oppose it.Reuters also reported pro-coup soldiers surrendering to the police in Taksim Square, Istanbul.It was reported that by 05:18, Atatürk airport had completely been recaptured by the government whilst the police had surrounded the coupists inside the Turkish army headquarters, calling for them to surrender.Between 06:00–08:00 a skirmish took place there.In Akar\'s absence, Ümit Dündar, head of the First Army, was appointed Acting Chief of Staff.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning of 16 July, soldiers blocking the Bosphorus Bridge surrendered to the police.According to the government-run Anadolu Agency, this consisted of a group of 50 soldiers.Some of these soldiers were lynched by civilians despite the police\'s efforts, who fired into the air to protect the surrendering soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile, in the headquarters of the Turkish Army, 700 unarmed soldiers surrendered as the police conducted an operation into the building while 150 armed soldiers were kept inside by the police.The coupists in the TRT building in Istanbul surrendered in the early morning as well.Chief of Staff Akar, held hostage at the Akıncı Air Base in Ankara, was also rescued by pro-state forces.\n\nOne of the primary reasons that the coup failed was chaos among the plotters\' ranks.Turkey\'s National Intelligence Organization (MİT) head Hakan Fidan discovered the coup plot, and the plotters were forced to execute the coup five hours ahead of schedule.One of the main organizers, General Semih Terzi, was shot dead by loyalist Sgt.Maj.Ömer Halisdemir at the onset, demoralizing and disrupting command and control of the rebels.These two incidents resulted in the coup being carried out in an uncoordinated manner.The highest ranking staff officers opposed the coup, and publicly ordered all personnel to return to their barracks.Acting outside the military chain of command, the rebels lacked the coordination and resources to achieve their goals.The conscripted soldiers that the rebels mobilized were uninformed of their mission\'s true purpose and became demoralized.Many surrendered rather than shoot demonstrators.The commander of the First Army in Istanbul, General Ümit Dündar, personally called Erdoğan to warn him of the plot, persuading him to evacuate his hotel ahead of the plotters, and helped to secure Istanbul for Erdoğan to land.The MİT also mobilized its anti-aircraft guns, which the plotters were unaware existed, deterring rebel jets and commando teams.\n\nEqually important to the coup\'s failure, according to military strategist Edward N. Luttwak, was the inability of the rebels to neutralize Erdoğan and other high ranking government officials, either by killing or detaining them.A unit of special forces was sent via helicopter to kill or capture the president, but missed because he had been evacuated by his security detail just minutes before.Once Erdoğan landed at Atatürk International Airport (which had been recaptured from the rebels by his supporters), It became highly unlikely that the coup attempt would succeed.According to a military source, several rebel F-16s targeted Erdoğan\'s presidential jet en route to Istanbul, but they did not fire.A senior Turkish counter-terrorism official later stated that the jets did not fire because the fighter jet pilots were told by President Erdoğan\'s pilot over the radio that the (flight of the) Gulfstream IV was a Turkish Airlines flight.\n\nAccording to Naunihal Singh, author of Seizing Power, the coup attempt also failed because the plotters failed to secure control of the media and shape the narrative.Successful coups require that the rebels control the mass media.This allows even small rebel contingents to portray themselves as fully in control, and their victory as inevitable.Consequently, they convince the public, along with neutral and even loyalist soldiers, to defect to them or not resist.The rebels failed to properly broadcast their messages effectively across the media that they controlled.They failed to capture Türksat, Turkey\'s main cable and satellite communications company, and failed to gain control of the country\'s television and mobile phone networks.This allowed Erdoğan to make his Facetime call, and to speak on television.\n\nOther scholars of civil-military relations, like Drew H. Kinney, have said reports like Luttwak and Singh\'s miss the point of their own analysis: civil resistance thwarted the coup.Luttwak argues that wayward elements of the Turkish armed forces could not silence Erdoğan.Singh says that the rebels could not project success because they couldn\'t control the message.Kinney states that neither of these reasons on their own matter, but rather it\'s their effect—civil disobedience—that is important.We might find that ""[Gülen\'s movement] ...[might] have had nothing to do with the attempted takeover in July, but civilians [nevertheless] definitely played a role in thwarting the coup,"" writes Kinney.""...[A]n unhappy civilian populace mobilized to face down the military.""\n\nErdoğan wasn\'t censored (Luttwak\'s point) and was therefore able to use FaceTime to mobilize resistance, which in turn hindered the conspirators\' ability to project success (Singh\'s point).The result is civilian resistance to soldiers, i.e., people power.The reason Singh, Luttwak, and other scholars of civil-military relations miss this is, according to Kinney, because they ""usually do not study extra-military reasons for coup failures/successes,"" but rather put a premium on ""the inner-workings of the [military] operation.""In short, they blame the military for its failure rather than acknowledge the power of the masses and their successes.\n\nPro-state forces sent text messages to every Turkish citizen calling for them to protest against the coup attempt.Throughout the night sela prayers were repeatedly called from mosque minarets across the country to encourage people to resist the coup plotters.While the sela is usually called from minarets to inform the public of a funeral, they are also traditionally performed to notify of a significant event, in this case ""to rally people"".\n\nThe coup plotters initiated their operation hours ahead of the planned time when they understood that their plans had been compromised.Had the coup been launched at its original time, the middle of the night, much of the population would have been asleep.The streets would have been mostly empty.\n\nReports have emerged, neither confirmed nor denied by Russia or Turkey that the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate intercepted signals on an imminent coup passed on to loyal Turkish operatives.The intercepted plans revealed several helicopters with commandos were on the way to Marmaris\'s coastal resort, where Erdoğan stayed, capturing or killing him.Pre-warned, Erdoğan left quickly to avoid them.\n\nAn extensive purge of the Turkish civil service began in the wake of the coup attempt, with President Erdoğan warning his opponents that ""they will pay a heavy price for this.""The New York Times along with some other Western media such as The Economist, described the purges as a ""counter-coup"", with the Times expecting the president to ""become more vengeful and obsessed with control than ever, exploiting the crisis not just to punish mutinous soldiers but to further quash whatever dissent is left in Turkey,"".As of 20 July 2016, the purge already had seen over 45,000 military officials, police officers, judges, governors and civil servants arrested or suspended, including 2,700 judges, 15,000 teachers, and every university dean in the country.\n\n163 generals and admirals were detained, around 45% of the Turkish military\'s total.\n\nOn 18 July 2016, United States State Secretary John Kerry urged Turkish authorities to halt the increasing crackdown on its citizens, indicating that the crackdown was meant to ""suppress dissent.""French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault voiced concern, warning against a ""political system which turns away from democracy"" in response to the purges.\n\nOn 17 August 2016, Turkey started releasing what was expected to eventually amount to about 38,000 prison inmates, to make more space in the penal system for detainees, numbering about 35,000, who were arrested or detained after being involved in or suspected of association, with the 2016 failed coup.\n\nOn 28 September 2016, Turkish justice minister Bekir Bozdağ said 70,000 people had been processed and 32,000 were formally arrested.\n\nMajor General Cahit Bakir, who commanded Turkish forces under NATO in Afghanistan, and Brigadier General Sener Topuc, responsible for education and aid in Afghanistan, were detained by authorities in Dubai connected with the failed coup.\n\nGeneral Akın Öztürk, former Commander of the Turkish Air Force, was the Turkish military attaché to Israel.He was arrested on charges of having played a leading role in the failed coup.Öztürk has denied the charges.\n\nGeneral Adem Huduti, the commander of the Second Army, positioned along the southern borders with Syria and Iraq, and General Erdal Öztürk, the commander of the 3rd Corps, were also arrested.\n\nRear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been stationed at NATO\'s Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk, Virginia, sought asylum in the United States after being recalled by the Turkish government.\n\nIn July 2018, Istanbul\'s 25th Criminal Court sentenced 72 former soldiers involved in the coup attempt to life in prison.\n\nOn 20 June 2019, a terrorism court in Turkey sentenced 151 people to life in prison, including General Akın Öztürk, former commander of Turkish Air Force and the most senior officer involved in the coup.128 people received ""aggravated life"" sentences, which indicates harsh conditions without parole, for their role in the coup, with another 23 receiving standard life sentences.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom President Erdoğan said as one of the principal conspirators, condemned the coup attempt and denied any role in it.""I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey,"" he said in an emailed statement reported by The New York Times.""Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force.I pray to God for Turkey, Turkish citizens, and all those currently in Turkey that this situation is resolved peacefully and quickly.As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nPresident Erdoğan asked the United States to extradite Gülen: ""I call on you again, after there was a coup attempt.Extradite this man in Pennsylvania to Turkey!If we are strategic partners or model partners, do what is necessary.""Prime Minister Yildirim has threatened war against any country that would support Gülen.Turkish Labor Minister Süleyman Soylu said that ""America is behind the coup.""\n\nRegarding the AKP\'s statement against Gülen, Secretary of State Kerry invited the Turkish government ""to present us with any legitimate evidence that withstands scrutiny,"" before they would accept an extradition request.\n\nOn 15 August 2016, former United States diplomat James Jeffrey, who was the United States ambassador to Turkey from 2008 until 2010 made the following remarks: ""The Gülen movement has some infiltration at the least in the military that I am aware of.They of course had extreme infiltration into the police and judiciary earlier.I saw that when I was in Turkey previously, particularly in the Sledgehammer case, Hakan Fidan case, and the corruption cases in 2013.Obviously, significant segment of Turkey\'s bureaucracy was infiltrated and had their allegiance to a movement.That of course is absolutely unacceptable and extremely dangerous.It likely led to the coup attempt.""\n\nOutside Turkey, in Beringen, Belgium, anti-coup protesters attempted to attack a building owned by the pro-Gülen movement group \'Vuslat\'.The police brought in a water cannon to keep the attackers at bay.In news articles it was stated that the police also protected the houses of Gülen supporters.People advocated on social media to go to Beringen once more, and there was unrest in Heusden-Zolder, elsewhere in Belgium.Furthermore, in Somalia the government ordered ""the total closure of all activities"" of an organization linked to the Gülen movement, and gave its staff seven days to leave the country.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, President Erdoğan said Western countries were ""supporting terrorism"" and the military coup, saying ""I\'m calling on the United States: what kind of strategic partners are we, that you can still host someone whose extradition I have asked for?""\n\nOn 31 January 2017, British Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, Alan Duncan said he believed the Gülen movement was responsible for the coup attempt.Duncan went on saying ""the organization which incorporated itself into the state tried to topple the democratic structure in Turkey"".\n\nIn a speech on 29 July 2016, President Erdoğan said U.S. Central Command chief Joseph Votel was ""siding with coup plotters""; Erdoğan said the United States was protecting Fethullah Gülen, whom the Turkish government blames for the coup attempt.Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim made similar comments.In response, Votel said that the Turkish government\'s statements were ""unfortunate and completely inaccurate"" and expressed concern that the mass arrests and firings of military officers would damage military cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey.Similarly, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said that the Turkish military purges were impairing the fight against ISIS.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, in an escalation of tensions with the United States, Erdoğan questioned Turkey\'s relationship with the United States and criticized the West, saying that ""script"" for the abortive putsch last month was ""written abroad"".Erdoğan stated that he had personally asked Obama to extradite Gülen to Turkey.When the U.S. government replied it would need evidence of the cleric\'s guilt before extradition, to which Erdoğan said: ""When you asked for the return of a terrorist, we did not ask for documentation. ...Let us put him on trial.""\n\nYeni Şafak daily, a Turkish pro-state newspaper, stated that the former commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, now-retired United States Army General John F. Campbell, was the ""mastermind"" behind the coup attempt in Turkey.Campbell called the statement ""absolutely ridiculous"" and President Obama said ""Any reports that we had any previous knowledge of a coup attempt, that there was any U.S. involvement in it, that we were anything other than entirely supportive of Turkish democracy are completely false, unequivocally false.""\n\nOn 1 December 2017, Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for American political analyst, former CIA official and former vice chairman of US National Intelligence Council Graham Fuller, stating his involvement in the coup.A career US State Department official who was once CIA Station Chief in Kabul and later went on to be a political scientist in Rand Corporation specializing in the Middle East, Turkish authorities said Fuller attended a meeting in Istanbul on 15 July 2016 involving organization and coordination of the botched coup.Another American among the attendance, as stated by the Turkish prosecutors, was academic Henri Barkey who was named a suspect a week after the failed coup.\n\nThe U.S. consulate in Turkey issued an advisory to U.S. citizens to avoid the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey, which houses about 50 nuclear bombs, until ""normal operations have been restored"".They stated that local authorities were denying access to the air base and that power supplying the air base was shut off.\n\nThe Incirlik base is important to the U.S.-led effort in Syria to combat ISIL and other militants.Nearly 1,500 American personnel are housed in the base.\n\nTwenty-four hours after initial reports that the air base was shut down, United States defense department officials confirmed that the base and its airspace had re-opened to military aircraft and that operations by American aircraft will resume.The Turkish commander of the air base, brig.Gen. Bekir Ercan Van was arrested.After the failure of the coup Gen Bekir Ercan Van sought asylum from the U.S., but his request was denied by U.S.\n\nFollowing the failed coup attempt multiple media outlets have published editorials advocating the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Incirlik Air base as Turkey is unstable.\n\nOn 16 July, anti-coup protesters chanted against locals in areas of Istanbul with high concentration of Alevis, including Okmeydanı and Gazi.Such incidents also occurred in a quarter of Antakya with a high Alevi population, where a motorcyclist stating to be a sharia advocate was lynched.In a neighbourhood of Ankara, shops belonging to Syrians were attacked by a mob.In Malatya, Sunni Islamists harassed residents of an Alevi neighbourhood, particularly the women, and attempted to enter the neighbourhood en masse.Police intervened and blocked all roads leading there.In Kadıköy, people drinking alcohol in public were attacked by a group of religious fundamentalists.\n\nFollowing the arrests, thousands of anti-coup protesters demanded instituting the death penalty against detainees connected with the coup, chanting ""we want the death penalty"".President Erdoğan has been open to reinstituting the death penalty, noting that ""in a democracy, whatever the people want they will get.""Turkish authorities have not executed anyone since 1984, but legally abolished capital punishment only in 2004 as a pre-condition to join the European Union.\n\nEuropean Union officials have been vocal about their opposition to purges by Turkish authorities in connection to the coup.French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that Turkey must work within the framework of the law to uphold Europe\'s democratic principles.Furthermore, on 18 July 2016, Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of Foreign Affairs of the European Union, announced that no country will be admitted into the European Union ""if it introduces the death penalty"".Moreover, German press secretary, Steffen Seibert, stated that reinstituting the death penalty will end Turkey\'s accession talks with the European Union.\n\nTurkey is a member of the Council of Europe, and ratified the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) as part of its terms of membership.The ECHR is an international treaty that includes the abolition of the death penalty among its terms.As such, Turkey is legally bound not to reintroduce the death penalty.\n\nOn 20 July 2016, President Erdoğan announced a three-month state of emergency in response to the attempted coup, invoking Article 120 of the Constitution of Turkey (""Declaration of state of emergency because of widespread acts of violence and serious deterioration of public order"").Under the state of emergency, under Article 121, ""the Council of Ministers, meeting under the chairpersonship of the President of the Republic, may issue decrees having the force of law on matters necessitated by the state of emergency"", with decrees subject to subsequent parliamentary approval.The state of emergency was endorsed by the Parliament on 21 July by 346 votes to 115.The Justice and Development Party and the Nationalist Movement Party supported the state of emergency, whilst the Republican People\'s Party and the Peoples\' Democratic Party opposed it.Prime Minister Yıldırım said at the Parliament that the state of emergency was necessary to ""get rid of this scourge rapidly"".\n\nAs part of the state of emergency, deputy prime minister Kurtulmuş announced that Turkey was temporarily suspending part of the European Convention on Human Rights following the attempted coup, invoking Article 15 of the Convention (""war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation"").The suspensions must be notified to the Council of Europe and may not affect the right to a fair trial or the prohibition on torture.\n\nThis state of emergency in Turkey as well as the hindrance of the right to protest that occurred within such framework have been layered onto a longer history of emergency rules, oppressive legislation and daily government practice that have reinforced both.We can see from this the ""autocratisation"" process in Turkey has thrived of existing legal framework deeply associated in legacies of past ""emergencies"".\n\nOn 3 October 2016 Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş declared the governments intention to extend the state of emergency by a further three months raising objections from both the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) and Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) were critical of the governments use of their emergency powers and declared that they would vote against an extension.\n\nFollowing the National Security Council\'s recommendation for the extension President Erdoğan stated that it was possible that the state of emergency could last for longer than a year prompting outcry from the opposition, Leader of the Main Opposition Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu said that ""The president saying that the state of emergency can last longer than 12 months is strengthening the fear of a counter-coup"" and that it was ""raising the prospect of opportunist measures.""\n\nThe AKP\'s governmental majority allowed the three-month extension to take effect on 19 October 2016.The two-year-long state of emergency was ended on 19 July 2018.\n\nOn 16 July 2016, the media reported that eight Turkish military personnel of various ranks had landed in Greece\'s northeastern city of Alexandroupolis on board a Black Hawk helicopter and claimed political asylum in Greece.While the Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu demanded extradition of ""the eight traitors as soon as possible"", the Greek authorities stated: ""We will follow the procedures of international law.However, we give severe considerations to the fact that [the Turkish military men] are accused, in their own country, of violating the constitutional order and trying to overthrow democracy.""The helicopter was returned to Turkey shortly thereafter.The eight asylum seekers, their asylum case pending, were later transferred to Athens, mainly for safety reasons.On 26 January, the Supreme Court of Greece eventually ruled against their extradition, on the grounds that the eight were unlikely to face a fair trial if returned to their home country and due to concerns over their safety.\n\nOn 15 February 2017, five Turkish commandos illegally entered Greece through the Evros river.However, once they entered the country, the group split.The two of them surrendered to the police and on 20 February 2017, requested political asylum.They were being held in the city of Alexandroupolis.The two men belonged to the Turkish navy.The names given by the two reportedly match the names of two fugitives wanted in relation to the shadowy operation against Erdoğan himself.The Greek government mentioned that the Greek authorities will not allow the country to be dragged into the ongoing feud between the Turkish state and the followers of Gulen.But there were no sign of the other three.According to a lawyer there were indications that the other three have been arrested by Greek authorities who were about to expel them to Turkey.According to new evidence and new information these three ""arrested"" marines were delivered under fast and informal procedures from Greek to Turkish services.\n\nAfter the coup attempt, two Turkish military attachés in Athens, Staff Col. İlhan Yaşıtlı and naval attaché Col. Halis Tunç, had reportedly disappeared along with their families.The Greek foreign ministry canceled the two attachés\' accreditations on 7 August 2016, upon the request of the Turkish foreign ministry.Greek media reported that they might have fled to Italy.On 11 August 2016, the Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu confirmed the reports saying that they had left Greece for Italy on 6 August and adding that Turkey would officially ask the Italian authorities to extradite the two soldiers.\n\nOn 9 August 2016, the media reported that Turkey\'s Rear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been on a United States-based assignment for NATO and after the coup was subject to a detention order in Turkey, had sought asylum in the United States.\n\nIn mid-November 2016, it was officially confirmed that about 40 Turkish military servicemen of various ranks stationed at NATO command structures had applied for asylum in Germany and Belgium.\n\nIn January 2017, Der Spiegel magazine and ARD broadcaster reported that about 40 mostly high-ranking Turkish soldiers who worked at NATO facilities in Germany requested asylum in Germany.\n\nAt the end of February 2017, Germany said it had received 136 asylum requests from Turks holding diplomatic passports since the July coup attempt.The figure was a total for August 2016 to January 2017; some were presumed to be military officers posted to NATO bases in Germany.\n\nIn November 2016, NATO\'s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that Turkish NATO Officers had requested asylum in the countries where they had been posted.He did not name the nations involved or the number of officers, saying it was a matter for those countries to decide.He said: ""Some Turkish officers working in NATO command structure ... have requested asylum in the countries where they are working. ...As always, this is an issue that is going to be assessed and decided by the different NATO allies as a national issue.""\n\nAs of March 2017, Norway have granted asylum for four Turkish soldiers and a military attache.\n\nSeveral Turkish citizens with diplomatic passports have sought political asylum in Switzerland.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, detainees in Turkey have been denied access to legal counsel, have been beaten and tortured.They have not been provided with adequate food, water, or medical care.At least one has attempted suicide.Amnesty International wanted the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture to send people to check on detainees conditions.A person who had been on duty at the Ankara police headquarters said that police denied medical treatment to a detainee.""Let him die.We will say he came to us dead,"" the witness quoted a police doctor as saying.\n\nAlso, Erdoğan has extended the maximum period of detention for suspects from four days to 30, a move Amnesty said increased the risk of torture or other maltreatment of detainees.\n\nTurkish Justice Ministry denied the reports and the Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said on his Twitter account: ""There has not been any torture or assault of detainees in custody,"" in response to reports by Amnesty International.""The claims of torture and assault make up a pre-packaged misinformation campaign formed by members of FETÖ, one which is untrue and distorted,""\n\nOn 7 August, between three and five million people gathered for an anti-coup rally organized by the Turkish authorities in Istanbul.President Erdoğan and the two leaders of the major opposition parties (the Republican People\'s Party and the Nationalist Movement Party) were present.\n\nGreek authorities on several Aegean islands have called for emergency measures to curtail a growing flow of refugees from Turkey; the number of migrants and refugees willing to make the journey across the Aegean has increased noticeably after the failed coup.At Athens officials voiced worries because Turkish monitors overseeing the deal in Greece had been abruptly pulled out after the failed coup without being replaced.Also, the mayor of Kos expressed concern in a letter to the Greek Prime Minister citing the growing influx of refugees and migrants after the failed coup.The Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises (SETE) warned about the prospect of another flare-up in the refugee/migrant crisis due to the Turkish political instability.\n\nVincent Cochetel, the director of the Europe Bureau of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in August 2016 that parts of the EU-Turkey deal about immigration were already de facto suspended because no Turkish police were present at Greek detention centres to oversee deportations.\n\nOn 25 August 2016, seven Turkish citizens sought asylum in Greece.Two were university professors, and their two children applied for asylum in Alexandroupoli after they illegally entered the country from the northeastern border.Also, three businessmen illegally reached the Greek island of Rhodes, and they also applied for asylum.\n\nOn 30 August 2016, a Turkish judge arrived at the Greek island of Chios on a migrant boat, with six Syrian nationals, and sought asylum in the country.He told the Greek coastguard and police officers that he is being persecuted in Turkey for his political beliefs by President Tayyip Erdoğan.The Turkish judge had been arrested for illegally entering the country and was transferred to Athens for his asylum proceedings.The Syrian nationals claimed refugee status.\n\nOn 11 September 2016, four Turkish civilians were arrested by Turkish police.An academic and a teacher attempted to escape to Greece illegally by crossing the Evros river, and the other two because they organized the escape attempt.The academic and the teacher paid a total of 12,500 euros in Istanbul to arrange their escape to Greece.Before their attempt, both the academic and the teacher were suspended from their duties as part of the ongoing probe into the failed coup attempt.Police also seized an air raft, an oar and a pump while detaining the suspects.The court later ordered the two\'s release while the other two suspects, who organized the escape attempt, were arrested.\n\nOn 21 September 2016, ten Turkish civilians, two men, two women and six children landed by boat illegally on the Greek island of Rhodes and sought asylum.They told the Greek authorities they were working in the private sector in Turkey and the Turkish government was persecuting them due to their political beliefs.\n\nOn 29 September 2016, five Turkish nationals, a couple and their child and two other men, arrived in Greece, at Alexandroupolis by crossing the Evros River by boat illegally and requested political asylum.\n\nOn 12 December 2016, one female Turkish national, landed by boat, full of refugees and immigrants, illegally on the Greek island of Lesbos.She requested political asylum.\n\nOn 24 October 2017, Turkish authorities obtained information that 995 Turks have applied for asylum in Greece after the coup attempt.\n\nMore than 1,800 Turkish citizens requested asylum in Greece in 2017.\n\nOn 18 February 2018, seventeen Turkish nationals, including six children, requested asylum in Greece at Oinousses island.\n\nIn August 2018, the former lawmaker for the Peoples\' Democratic Party, Leyla Birlik, requested asylum in Greece after illegally crossing the border near Alexandroupolis.\n\nBerlin mayor, Michael Müller (SPD), said Turkey was waging war on supporters of the Gülen movement in Germany.He said that Turkish officials had approached him and asked him whether he would be prepared to confront the Gülen movement in Berlin critically and, if necessary, to support measures against it.The mayor rejected the idea and made it very clear that Turkish conflicts could not be waged in the city.\n\nDer Spiegel presented classified documents, which showed that Turkey\'s secret service (MIT) had asked Germany\'s foreign intelligence agency (BND) for help in rounding up Gülen supporters in Germany.The Turkish secret service wanted the BND to use its influence to spur German lawmakers into taking action against Gülen supporters and extraditing them to Turkey.Also, Turkey\'s government has sent German authorities requests for searches and extraditions linked to supporters of Fethullah Gülen in Germany.\n\nIn Germany businesses thought to be in support of the Gülen movement have been harassed by Erdoğan supporters.\n\nAfter the failed coup, there was a massive demonstration in Cologne at Germany, in late July, in support of Turkish President Erdoğan.Erdoğan wanted to address the participants via video but was rejected by the local authorities and the German Constitutional Court due to security concerns.Turkey said that the ban was unacceptable and a violation of freedom of expression.\n\nGerman authorities said Turkish mosques in Germany were playing Turkish politics and worried that Turkey\'s internal politics spilled over into German cities.For years, German authorities had encouraged Turkey\'s state-run religious institution Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs usually referred to as DİTİB to provide Islamic preachers and teachers and Gülen Movement Schools for the large Turkish diaspora in Germany.DİTİB manages some 900 mosques in Germany.Gülen movement runs 100 educational facilities in Germany.\n\nAfter the failed coup DİTİB published a sermon praising ""our noble nation"" for rising against ""a wretched network"" that had sown ""seeds of sedition, rebellion and hostility.""According to Volker Beck, a member of the center-left Greens in Germany\'s Bundestag, ""That was not a religious text.It was a declaration of obedience to Mr. Erdoğan and his measures since the coup attempt,"" Volker Kauder, parliamentary group leader of the Germany\'s ruling Christian Democrats, the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU)/Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) faction, said Turkish-Germans should be loyal to Germany first and foremost.\n\nGermans of Turkish origin are being pressured in Germany by informers and officers of Turkey\'s MIT spy agency.According to reports Turkey had 6,000 informants plus MIT officers in Germany who were putting pressure on ""German Turks"".Hans-Christian Ströbele said that there was an ""unbelievable"" level of ""secret activities"" in Germany by Turkey\'s MIT agency.According to Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, not even the former communist East German Stasi secret police had managed to run such a large ""army of agents"" in the former West Germany: ""Here, it\'s not just about intelligence gathering, but increasingly about intelligence service repression.""\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nGermany\'s Office for Migration and Refugees said on 18 November 2016, it had received 4,437 political asylum requests from Turkish citizens up to October, compared to 1,767 for the whole of last year.""We must expect that the number of Turks who are seeking political asylum in Germany will continue to rise,"" said Stephan Mayer, the domestic policy speaker of the union coalition in the Bundestag.\n\nOn 10 December 2016, eleven Turkish nationals, 10 adults and one child, in a martial arts group have applied for asylum in Germany.\n\nAs of January 2018, Germany was first place and Greece second as EU destinations of choice for Turkish nationals requesting asylum after the coup attempt.\n\nTurkish police have carried out simultaneous raids in 18 cities against companies associated with United States-based Fethullah Gülen.The state-run Anadolu Agency said police searched 204 premises and detained 187 businessmen for ""membership in a terror organization"" and ""providing financial support to a terror organization"".All suspects\' assets were seized.\n\nWikiLeaks released Turkish emails and documents to respond to the Turkish government\'s purges that followed the coup attempt.In turn, the Turkish Telecommunications Communications Board blocked access to the WikiLeaks website.On 17 July 2016 Wikileaks had announced on Twitter, the leak of approximately 300,000 emails and over 500,000 documents, including those to and from AKP.\n\nWikiLeaks stated that it was attacked shortly after 17 July announcement of the planned publication and hypothesized that Turkish authorities were responsible.WikiLeaks stated in a tweet, ""our infrastructure is under sustained attack.""Tweets from WikiLeaks include ""We are unsure of the true origin of the attack.The timing suggests a Turkish state power faction or its allies.We will prevail & publish.""and: ""Turks will likely be censored to prevent them reading our pending release of 100k+ docs on politics leading up to the coup."", ""We ask that Turks are ready with censorship bypassing systems such as TorBrowser and uTorrent""; ""And that everyone else is ready to help them bypass censorship and push our links through the censorship to come.""\n\nUpon the release of the email dump, it has been reported that the emails contain little to no damning information, and instead are just mails from a public mailing list, but also linked externally to ""voter information on all of the women registered to vote in 78 out of Turkey\'s 81 provinces"".\n\nSeveral places were renamed to commemorate the failed coup: Boğaziçi Köprüsü (Bosphorus Bridge) → 15 Temmuz Şehitler Köprüsü Kızılay Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Kızılay Demokrasi Meydanı Ahmet Taner Kışlalı Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Milli İrade Meydanı (Reverted to original name a few days later) Büyük İstanbul Otogarı → İstanbul 15 Temmuz Demokrasi Otogarı In TRT, Yeni Haber Stüdyosu → 15 Temmuz Millet Stüdyosu Kazan → Kahramankazan about the province\'s local people\'s resistance to the coup plotters.Kahraman means ""hero"" in Turkish Niğde University → Niğde Ömer Halisdemir University\n\nIn 2018, the Istanbul Municipal Council decided to change the names of a total of 90 streets that included words which could be associated with FETÖ.\n\nThe Presidency of Religious Affairs stated that it would not be providing religious funeral services to the dead coupists, except for ""privates and low-ranking officers compelled by force and threats who found themselves in the midst of the conflict without full knowledge of anything"".\n\nA document dated 26 September 2016 showed that Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) asked Turkish missions and religious representatives abroad to profile Gülen movement expatriates living in their respective foreign countries.Gülen-linked schools, businesses, foundations, associations, media outlets and others were also included in the reports.Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs has gathered intelligence via imams from 38 countries.\n\nBelgium officials said they would withdraw recognition of Diyanet mosques in the country if necessary.\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nOn 21 December 2016, the Turkish government has recalled Yusuf Acar, the religious affairs attaché of the Turkish Embassy in the Netherlands, after Dutch authorities said he was spying.Acar collected information of people who sympathize with Fethullah Gülen at Netherlands and passed it on to the Turkish authorities.The Dutch government called spying activities an ""unwanted and non-acceptable interference in the lives of Dutch citizens.""and the attaché was reportedly declared persona non grata and received a ""deportation warning"" by Dutch authorities.\n\nOn 26 January 2017, President Erdoğan, during his visit to Tanzania, asked his Tanzanian counterpart John Magufuli to take action against the network of Fethullah Gülen.\n\nIn April 2017 it was announced that President Erdoğan planned to establish a purpose-built museum dedicated to the coup events, called the ""Museum of the 15 July: Martyrs and Democracy"", to be located in Kahramankazan, a town near Ankara.Paid for by Turkish Ministry of Culture funds, it is planned to open at the end of 2018.The museum opened in December 2019\n\nAmong the Turkish opposition parties, the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) issued a statement expressing their public opposition to the coup, and the Hürriyet Daily News reported that Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bahçeli telephoned Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım to express his opposition to the coup.The co-chairs of the opposition Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) issued a statement saying that the party was ""under all circumstances and as a matter of principle against all kinds of coup.""Amongst the minor parties, left-wing nationalist Patriotic Party\'s Doğu Perinçek backed democracy, when he held Gülen and the Americans responsible.Kurdish militant separatist organization Kurdistan Workers\' Party, which Turkey and its allies label as a terrorist organization, urged their supporters to stay away from the coup and rather defend their people, while the Communist Party called upon the people to overthrow the AKP government which they called an ""enemy of humanity"".\n\nDuring the first hours of the coup plotters\' moves of blocking Istanbul\'s bridges and flying fighter jets low over Istanbul and Ankara, Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjørn Jagland tweeted against the coup attempt and underlined that ""any attempt to overthrow the democratically elected leaders is unacceptable"".\n\nRussia\'s President Vladimir Putin called Erdoğan out of solidarity before all NATO member countries\' heads following the coup attempt.Erdoğan thanked the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev – who was the first president to show solidarity after the coup attempt – for his support in solving the 7-month crisis over downed Russian Sukhoi Su-24 and the Prime Minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, who was among the first NATO country leaders to condemn the coup attempt, already from the early hours of Saturday.\n\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the then prime minister of Pakistan, was all praise for the people of Turkey and the AKP government and strongly condemned what he termed as an attempt to undermine democracy in Turkey.""We deeply admire the resolve of the brave and resilient Turkish people, who stood up against the forces of darkness and anarchy to express their support and commitment to democracy,"" the PM said in a statement issued from his office.\n\nThe majority of countries either expressed their support for the government or called for restraint.On 16 July 2016, however, a proposed United Nations Security Council statement denouncing the coup was not accepted by Egypt, a non-permanent member of the Council at the time, due to textual disagreements.Egyptian diplomats said that the council is ""in no position to qualify, or label [the Turkish] government – or any other government for that matter – as democratically elected or not"".Objection by the United States and the UK – permanent members of the Security Council – led to Egypt proposing a new statement calling for all sides to ""respect the democratic and constitutional principles and the rule of law"", which was rejected, preventing the condemnation of the coup attempt by the Security Council.The leader of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky supported the coup attempt.\n\nAl-Monitor reported that ""Unlike Ankara\'s Western allies, Iran did not wait for the coup\'s failure to speak up.Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif voiced support for democracy in a Twitter message in the early hours of the unrest, writing ""Stability, and democracy in Turkey are paramount"".In a subsequent phone call after the failure of the coup attempt, President Hassan Rouhani told Erdoğan the coup attempt was ""a test to identify your domestic and foreign friends and enemies.""An Iranian official pointed out parallels between the coup attempt in Turkey and the coup against Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mussadiq in 1953: ""What we know is that this attempt was triggered by foreign hands.We have experienced the same thing in the past.Since Mr. Erdogan wants to play a more positive path in the region today, they want to overthrow him.""\n\nMustafa Akıncı, President of Northern Cyprus, welcomed the fact that ""no community in Turkey ... applauded the coup as they have done in the past.""Azerbaijan strongly condemned the attempted military coup in Turkey and considered such actions unacceptable according to a statement from Novruz Mammadov, deputy head of the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration and chief of the foreign relations department.\n\nEuropean Commissioner dealing with Turkey\'s EU membership bid, Johannes Hahn, said it appears Turkey\'s government prepared arrest lists of political opponents before the coup attempt and had been waiting for the right time to act.In this sense, EU reported that as a main criticism to put this issue in the category of terrorism become the violation of the fundamental rights and fundamental values of the citizens.Hence, it underlines a total divergence of opinions and mentality between EU and Turkey which reached a deadlock here especially after the 15th of July in 2016.\n\nOn 19 July 2016, White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said during a press briefing that President Barack Obama has held a phone conversation with President Erdoğan: ""The President used the phone call to reiterate once again the strong commitment of the United States to the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey.The President pledged any needed assistance to the Turkish government as they conduct an investigation to determine exactly what happened.""\n\nOn 20 July 2016, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""Turkey has a large armed force, professional armed forces and ...I am certain they will continue as a committed and strong NATO ally.""On a statement released on 10 August 2016, the Secretary General once more strongly condemned the attempted coup and reiterated full support for Turkey\'s democratic institutions.He also expressed support for the elected Turkish government and respect for the courage of the Turkish people for resisting the coup plotters.\n\nOn 29 July 2016, the commander of U.S. Central Command, General Joseph Votel, denied statements by Turkey\'s president Erdoğan that he has supported the coup attempt in Turkey.\n\nOn 1 August 2016, United States Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, General Joseph Dunford, visited Turkey and condemned the coup attempt.Dunford said: ""The consistent theme throughout the day was a reaffirmation of the importance of the U.S.-Turkey relationship – the need for us to cooperate.""\n\nOn July, 20, there were reports that a group of Turkish military commandos coup fugitives would try to cross from Turkey to the island of Symi, in the southeastern Aegean, at Greece.The Hellenic Coast Guard was on alert and increased the patrols in the area, especially after a group of inflatable dinghies and other vessels were seen departing from Datça, on the Turkish coast, in the direction of Symi, they monitored the movements of the Turkish vessels, which remained in Turkish waters.Furthermore, a contingent of the Hellenic Police was dispatched to Symi to conduct checks there.The Greek government had been anticipating a possible attempt by participants in the failed coup to come to Greece and took the reports seriously.Turkish F-16 fighter jets were also scrambled to check reports that missing Turkish coast guard vessels had appeared in Greek waters in the Aegean.Later on the day, the Turkish interior ministry denied reports that rebel soldiers might have ""hijacked"" a vessel to flee to Greece.The Greek armed forces remained on alert the throughout the day for potential coup fugitives.\n\nAccording to Michael Rubin, from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Erdoğan had himself to blame for the coup.Following an increasingly Islamist agenda, Erdoğan had reportedly ""dropped any pretense of governing for all Turks.""After ""fanning the flames"" at the 2013 Gezi Park protests, he transformed the predominantly Kurdish-inhabited areas of southeastern Turkey ""into a war zone reminiscent of the worst days of the 1980s.""The biggest problem, according to Rubin, might have been Erdoğan\'s foreign policy, which managed to turn the initial ""no problems with neighbors"" doctrine into a situation where the country has problems with almost every neighbor and has even alienated some of its allies and friends.Rubin previously worked as an official at the Pentagon and less than 4 months before the coup, he wrote an article in Newsweek magazine titled, ""Will There Be a Coup Against Erdogan in Turkey?""\n\nBritish Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk warned that ""too late did Erdoğan realize the cost of the role he had chosen for his country.It\'s one thing to say sorry to Putin and patch up relations with Netanyahu; but when you can no longer trust your army, there are more serious matters to concentrate upon.""Even if this coup may have failed, Fisk expected another to follow in the months or years to come.\n\nTurkish professor Akın Ünver described the coup d\'état attempt as ""more of a mutiny"".\n\nThe name of the ""Peace at Home Council"" – Yurtta Sulh Konseyi – is derived from Atatürk\'s famous saying \'Peace at Home, Peace in the World\'.Journalist Ezgi Başaran said that ""the statement of the junta, that was [...] read on the [...] government TV [channel] as the coup got under way, bore a strong resemblance to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk\'s famous address to the Turkish Youth.[...] On the other hand, given that these references are too obvious, they may have been intentionally included to insinuate a Kemalist junta rather than a Gülenist one.""\n\nThe citizen journalism site Bellingcat published an analysis of the messages of a WhatsApp group consisting of high-ranking military officials who had taken part in the coup covering their activities including them killing several people.The messages were cross referenced with video footage.The group was named ""Yurtta sulh"" which refers to a peace at home speech and they seem secular and military with no references to Gülen or anything related during the several hours of messaging.\n\nNews reports have suggested that the coup ringleader was Adil Öksüz.Some believe Öksüz to have been an operative with Turkish intelligence.\n\nGerman Islamic studies scholar said the putschists tried to forestall a large-scale purge of judiciary and military, the implementation of which had already started on Saturday, the day after the coup attempt.According to Turkish investigative journalist Ahmet Şık, a list of officials to be purged had been ready compiled by the attorney-general of Izmir, Okan Bato, and was approved by President Erdoğan.According to this version, the putschists had to quickly bring forward their coup attempt before being disposed and arrested.\n\nDuring and after the events, several politicians and commentators suggested that the government knew about the coup in advance and possibly directed it.The facts that the coup attempt began in the evening rather than at a more inconspicuous time and that the events were largely confined to Ankara and Istanbul contributed to doubts about the authenticity of the coup attempt.Journalists and opposition politicians branded it a \'tragic comedy\' and \'theatre play\'.Advocates of such theories pointed to how Erdoğan stood to gain from the coup attempt in terms of increasing his popularity and support for his calls for an executive presidency, while being able to legitimize further crackdowns on judicial independence and the opposition in general.\n\nOther elements that were reported to support the theory included: no list of demands by the coup plotters, the organization and response of the police, the long lists of arrests that seemed to be ready surprisingly quickly (including arrests of 2,745 judges and 2,839 soldiers), and the obvious nature of the coup actions.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom Erdoğan had said as being one of the principal conspirators, commented, ""I don\'t believe that the world believes the accusations made by President Erdoğan.There is a possibility that it could be a staged coup and it could be meant for further accusations [against the Gülenists].""Journalist Cengiz Çandar, a veteran observer of Turkey\'s coups, said ""I have never seen any with this magnitude of such inexplicable sloppiness.""Prominent Hizmet (Gülen movement) spokesman Alp Aslandogan said, referencing that the Turkish Air Force commander met with Erdoğan before 15 July, that certain legal documentation related to the coup seemed written beforehand, arguing that within ""the indictment written by a prosecutor on the night of 15 July to 16 July, there were events there that didn\'t actually happen.Some events did happen, but those events didn\'t happen by the time the document started.It looks like a bigger plan was there, and part of the plan did not come to pass.""\n\nThe organization and spontaneous synchronization by large numbers of mosques was perceived to be unachievable unless there had been prior preparation, with journalists also pointing to how Erdoğan could have strategically used the call to prayer to invoke religious sentiment in a political situation as a veiled attack on state secularism.\n\nThousands of arrests and purges were conducted by Turkish authorities between 16 and 18 July 2016.The sheer number of these arrests made at such a speed could only be done so if the ""Turkish government had all those lists ready"", as suggested by Johannes Hahn, European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, on 18 July 2016.Hahn also said that because these lists were already available immediately after the coup, the ""event was prepared"" and the lists were to be used ""at a certain stage"".\n\nMehmet Dişli, who was seen giving orders to the coup plotters and who was the one who put a belt around Hulusi Akar\'s neck to make him sign, is the brother of Şaban Dişli, a former vice president of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and confidant of Erdoğan.\n\nSeveral social media users have compared the coup attempt to the Reichstag fire in 1933, which Adolf Hitler used as an excuse to suspend civil liberties and order mass arrests of his opponents.Politico correspondent Ryan Heath said that ""the coup was staged to allow Erdoğan to purge the military of opponents and increase his grip on the country"".Heath used Twitter to share comments from his Turkish source, who called the events of Friday night a ""fake coup"" which would help a ""fake democracy warrior"" (referring to Erdoğan).The source said: ""Probably we\'ll see an early election [in] which he\'ll try to guarantee an unbelievable majority of the votes.And this will probably guarantee another 10–15 years of authoritarian, elected dictatorship.""\n\nThe New York Times reported that some Turkish citizens believed the coup attempt was staged by Erdoğan to improve his public image and popularity, while cracking down on political opponents and expanding his power.Critics found it suspect that reportedly no government officials were arrested or harmed during the attempted coup, which—among other factors—raised the suspicion of a false flag event staged by the Turkish government to crack down on opposition parties.Those in Turkey suggesting that the coup was staged are also being questioned by the government.\n\nPoliticians and journalists who were skeptical of the authenticity of the coup plot said that in reality, a \'civil coup\' had effectively been staged against the Armed Forces and Judiciary, both of which were extensively purged of stated Gülen supporters by the government shortly after the events.Skeptics said that the coup would be used as an excuse for further erosion of judicial independence and a crackdown on the opposition, giving the AKP greater and unstoppable power over all state institutions and paving the way for a more radical Islamist agenda at odds with the founding principles of the Turkish Republic.\n\nJustice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said in late July 2016 that Turkish social media users who said the government was staging the coup faced investigation: ""Just look at the people who are saying on social media that this was theatre.Public prosecutors are already investigating them.Most of them are losers who think it is an honor to die for Fethullah Gülen\'s command.""\n\nOn 12 July 2017, Stockholm Center for Freedom, a monitoring group with reported links to the Gülen movement, published a controversial report stating that President Erdogan orchestrated the coup bid as a false flag to consolidate his powers, set up his opposition for a mass persecution, and push Turkish Armed Forces into a military incursion into Syria.According to the report, it uncovered new evidence from 11 July 2016, four days before the planned coup bid, that a secret plan was circulated among select group of Armed Forces to give an appearance of a coup attempt.The plan was sanctioned by intelligence and military chiefs with the approval of Erdogan.\n\nIn early November 2017, Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for , former Director of the Middle East Program of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, stating that he is an agent of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), that he was present in Istanbul during the 2016 Turkish coup attempt, and that he was one of the key organizers behind the coup attempt.Around 1 December, the Istanbul prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for Graham E. Fuller, an American author and political analyst specializing in Islamic extremism after a long CIA career and holding the role of vice-chair of the United States National Intelligence Council.The prosecutor\'s office based the warrant on suspicion of Fuller helping to plan the coup attempt.Hürriyet stated that Turkish authorities believed that they had traced Fuller\'s location before the attempted coup and afterward when he left Turkey.\n\nBarkey denied his reported role in the coup, describing the claims as ""so ludicrous that they do not even deserve the term \'science fiction\'.""\n\nDeep state in Turkey The Imam\'s Army List of coups and coup attempts since 2010 List of modern conflicts in the Middle East List of attacks on legislatures\n', 'Claim_Context': 'In March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.

116,"{'Wiki_Title': '2016 Turkish coup attempt', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'On 15 July 2016, a faction within the Turkish Armed Forces, organized as the Peace at Home Council, attempted a coup d\'état against state institutions, including the government and president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.They attempted to seize control of several places in Ankara, Istanbul, Marmaris and elsewhere, such as the Asian side entrance of the Bosphorus Bridge, but failed to do so after forces and civilians loyal to the state defeated them.The Council cited an erosion of secularism, elimination of democratic rule, disregard for human rights, and Turkey\'s loss of credibility in the international arena as reasons for the coup.The government said it had evidence the coup leaders were linked to the Gülen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the Republic of Turkey and led by Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish businessman and a well-known Islamic scholar who lives in exile in Pennsylvania.The Turkish government alleged that Gülen was behind the coup (which Gülen denied) and that the United States was harboring him.Events surrounding the coup attempt and the purges in its aftermath reflect a complex power struggle between Islamist elites in Turkey.\n\nDuring the coup attempt, over 300 people were killed and more than 2,100 were injured.Many government buildings, including the Turkish Parliament and the Presidential Palace, were bombed from the air.Mass arrests followed, with at least 40,000 detained, including at least 10,000 soldiers and 2,745 judges, for being affiliated with the coup attempt.15,000 education staff were also suspended and the licenses of 21,000 teachers working at private institutions were revoked after the government stated they were loyal to Gülen.More than 77,000 people have been arrested and over 160,000 fired from their jobs, on reports of connections to Gülen.\n\nThere were many reactions against the coup attempt, both domestically and internationally.The main opposition parties in Turkey condemned the attempt, while several international leaders—such as those of the United States, NATO, the European Union, and neighboring countries—called for ""respect of the democratic institutions in Turkey and its elected officials.""Many international organizations also opposed the coup.The United Nations Security Council, however, did not denounce the coup after disagreements over the phrasing of a statement.Iran opposed the coup and advised Erdogan to defeat the coup plotters.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the head of United States Central Command, General Joseph Votel, was ""siding with coup plotters"", after Votel criticized the Turkish government for arresting the Pentagon\'s contacts in Turkey.\n\nIn March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.The same month, the British Parliament\'s Foreign Affairs Select Committee said some Gulenists were involved in the coup d\'état attempt but found no hard evidence that Fethullah Gülen masterminded the failed coup and found no evidence to justify the United Kingdom designating the Gülen movement as a ""terrorist organization"".\n\nSince the 1970s, followers of the influential cleric Fethullah Gülen had assumed increasingly important positions within the Turkish state apparatus.Gülen several times advised his followers to take key positions in society and government, if necessary with a secret identity to avoid opposition from the laicistic Turkish army and government.Nevertheless, at the start of the 21st century, Gülen\'s followers achieved crucial positions of power in Turkey (and beyond) with a vast network of newspapers, TV channels, schools, associations, lobby organizations, financial institutions and positions within the state such as the army and the judiciary.Initially, the then Prime Minister Erdogan seemingly tolerated the power of the Gülen movement because of common interests such as limiting the undemocratic political power of the military, but also because of impotence and fear of Gülen\'s power within Turkey.\n\nA series of events eventually led to a rift between Erdogan and Gülen.For example, prosecutors that allegedly were aligned with the Gülen movement tried to arrest the intelligence chief Hakan Fidan for the peace negotiations with the PKK, and by extension PM Erdogan subsequently, as the Turkish secret service is directly subordinate to the prime minister of Turkey.During this period (2010-2013), state secrets were leaked, fraud was committed with the entrance exams for government employees (KPSS), a change of power occurred at the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) and (sex)tapes of both government members and opposition members were leaked.Following these events and other incidents, the Turkish government decided to designate the Gülen movement as parallel state and FETÖ (Fethullahist Terror Organization).Alleged Gülen supporters were fired or arrested.The coup attempt that followed is therefore also described by some analysts as a last desperate attempt by Gülenists to retain power.\n\nIt is widely reported that Kemalist ideology played a huge role in motivating the 15 July 2016 coup attempt, like all previous political interventions in the history of Turkey\'s military coups.Since the establishment of multiparty democracy in Turkey in 1946, the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), together with the judiciary, have viewed themselves as guardians of Kemalist ideals and the secular Turkish nationalist state established under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk against political parties that have promoted a larger role for Islam and minorities in public life.The military and judiciary have regularly intervened in politics to block or ban popular parties representing conservative Muslim Turks, attempting to relax the restrictions on traditional religious practices, such as women\'s wearing of headscarves.The military has toppled four elected governments: by coups in 1960 and 1980, and by military decisions in 1971 and 1997.The military has also banned several major political parties.In 1998, Erdoğan, then-mayor of Istanbul, was banned for life from politics and jailed because he had read a religious poem by Ziya Gökalp several years before, at a public meeting.In 2007, the military expressed its opposition to the election of Abdullah Gül, of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), as president, by issuing an e-memorandum.Still, Gül was eventually elected when the AKP won both a referendum on the matter.Also, a snap election, and the party returned with a larger majority in the parliament.The military cited erosion of secularism as one of the reasons for the coup in the statement published on the day of the coup.\n\nAs opposed to previous political interventions by the Turkish military, Turkey\'s AKP government and pro-state media maintain that the 15 July 2016 coup attempt was not motivated by allegiance to Kemalist ideology, but rather to the vast political, economic, and religious network led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen.Between 2007 and 2012, high-profile Kemalists, including high-ranking officers of the Turkish Armed Forces, faced a series of trials and purges, under reports of involvement in a secret society codenamed ""Ergenekon.""Supported by Islamist (both pro-Gülen and pro-Erdoğan) prosecutors, security officials, and media, the purges allowed lower-rank Islamist officers to assume high-ranking military positions.They were seen as a bid by Turkey\'s civilian leaders under President Erdoğan to establish dominance over the military.In these trials in 2013 – viewed as ""sensational"" and ""one of the biggest in recent Turkish history"" – 275 people, including senior military officers, journalists, lawyers, and academics, were said to be involved in the so-called ""Ergenekon"" conspiracy, reportedly plotting a coup in 2003/04 against then–Prime Minister Erdoğan.Additionally, some military officers were said to be involved in a separate reported plot, Sledgehammer.Simultaneously, Erdoğan promoted lower-ranking officers up the chain of command, ensuring that the military chief of staff was loyal to him and thereby demoralizing the army.\n\nThe AKP\'s alliance with Gülen started to collapse during 2013 as Gülenists targeted the AKP using corruption charges.After the split, Erdoğan decided it would be advantageous to rehabilitate the army.The ""Ergenekon"" convictions were overturned in April 2016 by the Court of Cassation, which ruled that the existence of the network was unproven.\n\nIn 2013, law enforcement efforts to fight corruption, which had led to the 2013 corruption scandal in Turkey, were faulted by Erdoğan.The anti-corruption efforts were a source of tension between the Gülenists and the AKP.In political analysis in the months prior to the coup attempt, the incidence of corruption was reported to be ""rife"" in Turkey.Following the coup attempt, some coup leaders cited corruption as a reason for their actions.\n\nOn 13 July, less than two days before the coup was launched, Erdoğan signed a bill giving Turkish soldiers immunity from prosecution while taking part in domestic operations.The bill requires cases against commanders to be approved by the prime minister, while district governors may sign cases against lower-ranking soldiers.The immunity bill was seen as part of the détente between the government and the armed forces.The latter has increasingly been taking over military operations in Kurdish-inhabited areas from police and paramilitary units.\n\nOn 15 July 2016, as reported just before 23:00 EEST (UTC+3), military jets were spotted flying over Ankara, and both the Fatih Sultan Mehmet and Bosphorus bridges in Istanbul were closed.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said military action was being ""taken outside the chain of command"" and it was an ""illegal attempt"" to seize power by ""part of the military"".He further said that those involved ""will pay the highest price.""Local media also reported tanks in Istanbul\'s Atatürk Airport.It was reported that Internet users within Turkey were blocked from accessing Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.Twitter later stated that it had ""no reason to think we\'ve been fully blocked"".Some hostages were taken at military headquarters, including the Turkish Chief of the General Staff Hulusi Akar.At around 21:00, the coupists had invited Salih Zeki Çolak, the commander of the Turkish Land Forces to the military headquarters.When he arrived, he was immediately apprehended.Abidin Ünal, head of the Turkish Air Force, who had been attending a wedding in Istanbul, was abducted from there by soldiers who descended from a helicopter.The coupists then tried to force Akar to sign the coup declaration, almost strangling him using a belt in the process.He refused and was then taken to the Akıncı Air Base and other commanders at the headquarters.The military also entered the Justice and Development Party\'s offices in Istanbul and asked people to leave.\n\nEarly reports said President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was safe in Marmaris, south-west Turkey, where he had been on holiday.\n\nFrom around 23:00 to midnight, helicopters bombed the police special forces headquarters and police air force headquarters in Gölbaşı, just outside of Ankara.The attacks left 42 dead and 43 injured.Türksat headquarters in Gölbaşı was also attacked, killing two security personnel.\n\nAt around 23:50, soldiers occupied Taksim Square in central Istanbul.\n\nAt 00:02, it was reported by Reuters that soldiers were inside the buildings of the state broadcaster, the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), in Ankara.During the coup attempt, soldiers forced anchor Tijen Karaş to read out a statement saying that ""the democratic and secular rule of law has been eroded by the current government"" and that Turkey was now led by the Peace at Home Council who would ""ensure the safety of the population.""The statement read in part: ""Turkish Armed Forces have completely taken over the administration of the country to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedoms, the rule of law and general security that was damaged.[...] All international agreements are still valid.We hope that all of our good relationships with all countries will continue.""The plotters said they had ""done so to preserve democratic order, and that the rule of law must remain a priority"".The statement also ordered temporary martial law (sıkıyönetim), and said a new constitution would be prepared ""as soon as possible"".TRT was then taken off air.\n\nOther media outlets were also raided by the putschists, such as Turkish newspaper Hürriyet and private broadcaster CNN Türk.\n\nReuters reported on 15 July that an EU source described the coup as ""well orchestrated,"" and predicted that ""given the scale of the operation, it is difficult to imagine they will stop short of prevailing.""Another EU diplomat said that the Turkish ambassador in his capital was shocked and ""taking it very seriously"".\n\nThe Peace at Home Council was reportedly chaired by Muharrem Köse.\n\nAdana: Upon receiving the intelligence that thirty soldiers from the 10th Air Base Command would move to the base where the regional and provincial gendarmerie commands were located, the police prevented the soldiers from leaving the guardhouse with TOMA and armored vehicles and blocked them.Bitlis: In the Tatvan district of Bitlis, on the orders of Brigade Commander Arif Seddar Afşar, helicopters were circulated in the skies of Tatvan and fired at the city.The brigade command left the municipality\'s construction equipment in front of the barracks in case there was a tank operation in the district.Denizli: Approximately five hundred officers and non-commissioned officers who participated in the coup attempt surrendered to the gendarmerie and police forces.They were interrogated at Çardak District Gendarme Command.Kars: With the order of Kars 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, the soldiers who came with tanks and armored personnel carriers surrounded the Police Headquarters building and wanted to detain Faruk Karaduman, the chief of police.At the same hours, the invitation of Deputy Governors, 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, went to the command.Kocaeli: Turkcell\'s data center in Gebze was raided by soldiers who participated in the coup attempt.Soldiers who tried to interrupt the internet service were detained.Malatya: A rebellious soldier opened fire inside a base of the Turkish 2nd Army, damaging six vehicles.The base was besieged by police and loyal soldiers, and the shooter was captured.Marmaris: Three military helicopters carried out a bomb attack on the hotel where Erdoğan was staying.Forty rebellious soldiers of the Special Forces Command clashed with the police in the region.Mersin: Mersin Garrison and Mediterranean Region Commander Admiral Nejat Atilla Demirhan called Mersin Provincial Police Deputy Chief Yakup Usta and Gendarmerie Colonel Mustafa Bakçepınar and stated that the Turkish Armed Forces had taken over the administration.He introduced himself as the martial law garrison commander and ordered Mersin Governor Özdemir Çakacak and district governors to be taken into custody.Demirhan and Dağdelen, who made the same announcement with the police radio obtained from Mersin Police Department, were detained through the operation of the security forces.Sakarya: Sakarya Governorship was captured with armored personnel carriers, military trucks and many military jeeps from the military unit in the Kandıra district of Kocaeli.As a reinforcement, two military vehicles full of soldiers from the Sakarya central division command had to return to their barracks in the face of the resistance of the police and the harsh reaction of the people who took to the streets against the putschists.The vehicles occupying the Sakarya Governorate were seized by the citizens and the soldiers in them were neutralized and handed over to the security forces.Afterwards, citizens and security forces entered the governor\'s office and neutralized the soldiers there and suppressed the uprising in the province.Eight civilian citizens were injured as a result of the fire opened by the military during the incident.Şırnak: Çakırsöğüt Gendarmerie Commando Brigadier General Ali Osman Gürcan and 309 soldiers, that participated in the coup attempt, were detained by the security forces.\n\nTurkey\'s Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım responded to the events by stating that an ""illegal action is taking place outside of the chain of command"".He also said that ""the government elected by the people remains in charge and this government will only go when the people say so.""The Turkish Presidential office said President Erdoğan was on holiday inside Turkey and condemned the coup attempt as an attack on democracy.A presidential source also said Erdoğan and his government were still in power.The first messages from Erdoğan were transmitted at around 00:23At about 01:00, Erdoğan did a FaceTime interview with CNN Türk, in which he called upon his supporters to take to the streets in defiance of the military-imposed curfew, saying ""There is no power higher than the power of the people.Let them do what they will at the public squares and airports.""Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş appeared on live television, saying Turkey\'s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is still in charge of the government.The mayor of Ankara, Melih Gökçek of the AKP, encouraged people to go out to the city\'s streets in defiance, despite a curfew imposed by the military.Erdoğan\'s plane took off from Dalaman Airport near Marmaris at 23:47, but had to wait in the air south of Atatürk for the airport to be secured.His plane landed at 02:50\n\nThe First Army General Command in Istanbul stated in a news conference that the TSK did not support the coup and the perpetrators represented a tiny faction that were on the verge of being brought under control.Istanbul Atatürk Airport was closed; all flights from the airport were cancelled.There was an explosion in the TRT broadcasting headquarters and gunfire was reported in Ankara.Soon after, it was stormed by a crowd of civilians and police, with four soldiers inside reportedly being ""neutralized"".The channel went back on air and Karaş, who had previously announced the coup, said live that she had been held hostage and forced to read the declaration of the coup at gunpoint.\n\nBy 01:00, it was reported that the military had pulled its forces from the Atatürk airport and people were coming inside, but by 01:13, it was reported that tanks were inside the airport and gunfire was heard.\n\nTanks opened fire near the Turkish Parliament Building.The parliamentary building was also hit from the air.Injuries were reported among protesters following gunfire on Bosphorus Bridge.\n\nA helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was shot down by a Turkish military F-16 fighter jet.There were also reports of pro-state jets flying over Ankara to ""neutralize"" helicopters used by those behind the coup.\n\nAt 03:08, a military helicopter opened fire on the Turkish parliament.At 03:10, Turkish Armed Forces stated on their website that they had complete control over the country.At 03:12, Yıldırım made a statement saying that the situation was under control and that a no-fly zone was declared over Ankara and that military planes that still flew would be shot down.\n\nIt was reported that the Turkish parliament had been bombed again at 03:23 and 03:33.A helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was also seen flying by it.Half an hour following the report of 12 deaths and 2 injuries in the parliament, soldiers entered CNN Türk\'s headquarters and forced the studio to go off air.After an hour of interruption by the pro-coup soldiers, CNN Türk resumed its broadcast.Later, İsmail Kahraman said a bomb exploded at a corner of the public relations building inside the parliament, with no deaths but several injuries among police officers.\n\nAt around 04:00 two or three helicopters attacked Erdogan\'s hotel.According to eyewitness accounts, ten to fifteen heavily armed men landed and started firing.In the ensuing conflict, two policemen were killed and 8 were injured.\n\nThe Doğan News Agency reported that in Istanbul several individuals were injured after soldiers fired on a group of people attempting to cross the Bosphorus Bridge in protest of the attempted coup.\n\nOn Saturday 16 July 2016, at 00:42 EEST (UTC+3), a Turkish Black Hawk helicopter sent a distress signal and requested permission from Greek authorities for an emergency landing, and landed eight minutes later (00:50) at the Dimokritos airport in Alexandroupoli, in Greece, while two Greek F-16s observed the procedure and escorted it to the airport.The first reports said that the passengers were seven military personnel and a civilian.Later, it turned out that all were military personnel (two majors, four captains and two non-commissioned officers).They had removed the badges and insignia from their uniforms, making it impossible to know their rank.All were arrested after landing for illegal entry into the country.They were transferred to the local police station, while the Greek authorities at the airport guarded the helicopter.The eight passengers all requested political asylum in Greece as they believed they would not get a fair trial in Turkey.On 21 September 2016, Greece denied three out of the eight asylum.The men\'s lawyer Stavroula Tomara said they would be appealing the decision and said they had the ""impression that the decision has been predetermined, and that the interview was conducted just as a formality.""On 11 October 2016, four more of the eight were denied asylum.Two of the men who had previously been denied asylum applied for a re-evaluation but their applications were also rejected.\n\nAfter Erdoğan flew into Istanbul, he made a televised speech inside the airport at around 04:00, whilst thousands gathered outside.He addressed a crowd of supporters in the airport, at about 06:30 He said, ""In Turkey, armed forces are not governing the state or leading the state.They cannot.""He blamed ""those in Pennsylvania"" (a reference to Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, and his Hizmet Movement) for the coup attempt.Erdoğan also said he had plans to ""clean up"" the army, saying that ""This uprising is a gift from God to us.""State-run Anadolu Agency named former Colonel Muharrem Köse, who in March 2016 was dishonorably discharged for reported association with Gülen, as the suspected leader of the coup.However, the Alliance for Shared Values, a non-profit organization associated with Gülen, released a statement reiterating that it condemns any military intervention in domestic politics, and saying Erdoğan\'s allegations against the movement were ""highly irresponsible"".Gülen himself said in a brief statement just before midnight: ""As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nReuters reported that in early hours of 16 July, the coup appeared to have ""crumbled"" as crowds defied pro-coup military orders and gathered in major squares of Istanbul and Ankara to oppose it.Reuters also reported pro-coup soldiers surrendering to the police in Taksim Square, Istanbul.It was reported that by 05:18, Atatürk airport had completely been recaptured by the government whilst the police had surrounded the coupists inside the Turkish army headquarters, calling for them to surrender.Between 06:00–08:00 a skirmish took place there.In Akar\'s absence, Ümit Dündar, head of the First Army, was appointed Acting Chief of Staff.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning of 16 July, soldiers blocking the Bosphorus Bridge surrendered to the police.According to the government-run Anadolu Agency, this consisted of a group of 50 soldiers.Some of these soldiers were lynched by civilians despite the police\'s efforts, who fired into the air to protect the surrendering soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile, in the headquarters of the Turkish Army, 700 unarmed soldiers surrendered as the police conducted an operation into the building while 150 armed soldiers were kept inside by the police.The coupists in the TRT building in Istanbul surrendered in the early morning as well.Chief of Staff Akar, held hostage at the Akıncı Air Base in Ankara, was also rescued by pro-state forces.\n\nOne of the primary reasons that the coup failed was chaos among the plotters\' ranks.Turkey\'s National Intelligence Organization (MİT) head Hakan Fidan discovered the coup plot, and the plotters were forced to execute the coup five hours ahead of schedule.One of the main organizers, General Semih Terzi, was shot dead by loyalist Sgt.Maj.Ömer Halisdemir at the onset, demoralizing and disrupting command and control of the rebels.These two incidents resulted in the coup being carried out in an uncoordinated manner.The highest ranking staff officers opposed the coup, and publicly ordered all personnel to return to their barracks.Acting outside the military chain of command, the rebels lacked the coordination and resources to achieve their goals.The conscripted soldiers that the rebels mobilized were uninformed of their mission\'s true purpose and became demoralized.Many surrendered rather than shoot demonstrators.The commander of the First Army in Istanbul, General Ümit Dündar, personally called Erdoğan to warn him of the plot, persuading him to evacuate his hotel ahead of the plotters, and helped to secure Istanbul for Erdoğan to land.The MİT also mobilized its anti-aircraft guns, which the plotters were unaware existed, deterring rebel jets and commando teams.\n\nEqually important to the coup\'s failure, according to military strategist Edward N. Luttwak, was the inability of the rebels to neutralize Erdoğan and other high ranking government officials, either by killing or detaining them.A unit of special forces was sent via helicopter to kill or capture the president, but missed because he had been evacuated by his security detail just minutes before.Once Erdoğan landed at Atatürk International Airport (which had been recaptured from the rebels by his supporters), It became highly unlikely that the coup attempt would succeed.According to a military source, several rebel F-16s targeted Erdoğan\'s presidential jet en route to Istanbul, but they did not fire.A senior Turkish counter-terrorism official later stated that the jets did not fire because the fighter jet pilots were told by President Erdoğan\'s pilot over the radio that the (flight of the) Gulfstream IV was a Turkish Airlines flight.\n\nAccording to Naunihal Singh, author of Seizing Power, the coup attempt also failed because the plotters failed to secure control of the media and shape the narrative.Successful coups require that the rebels control the mass media.This allows even small rebel contingents to portray themselves as fully in control, and their victory as inevitable.Consequently, they convince the public, along with neutral and even loyalist soldiers, to defect to them or not resist.The rebels failed to properly broadcast their messages effectively across the media that they controlled.They failed to capture Türksat, Turkey\'s main cable and satellite communications company, and failed to gain control of the country\'s television and mobile phone networks.This allowed Erdoğan to make his Facetime call, and to speak on television.\n\nOther scholars of civil-military relations, like Drew H. Kinney, have said reports like Luttwak and Singh\'s miss the point of their own analysis: civil resistance thwarted the coup.Luttwak argues that wayward elements of the Turkish armed forces could not silence Erdoğan.Singh says that the rebels could not project success because they couldn\'t control the message.Kinney states that neither of these reasons on their own matter, but rather it\'s their effect—civil disobedience—that is important.We might find that ""[Gülen\'s movement] ...[might] have had nothing to do with the attempted takeover in July, but civilians [nevertheless] definitely played a role in thwarting the coup,"" writes Kinney.""...[A]n unhappy civilian populace mobilized to face down the military.""\n\nErdoğan wasn\'t censored (Luttwak\'s point) and was therefore able to use FaceTime to mobilize resistance, which in turn hindered the conspirators\' ability to project success (Singh\'s point).The result is civilian resistance to soldiers, i.e., people power.The reason Singh, Luttwak, and other scholars of civil-military relations miss this is, according to Kinney, because they ""usually do not study extra-military reasons for coup failures/successes,"" but rather put a premium on ""the inner-workings of the [military] operation.""In short, they blame the military for its failure rather than acknowledge the power of the masses and their successes.\n\nPro-state forces sent text messages to every Turkish citizen calling for them to protest against the coup attempt.Throughout the night sela prayers were repeatedly called from mosque minarets across the country to encourage people to resist the coup plotters.While the sela is usually called from minarets to inform the public of a funeral, they are also traditionally performed to notify of a significant event, in this case ""to rally people"".\n\nThe coup plotters initiated their operation hours ahead of the planned time when they understood that their plans had been compromised.Had the coup been launched at its original time, the middle of the night, much of the population would have been asleep.The streets would have been mostly empty.\n\nReports have emerged, neither confirmed nor denied by Russia or Turkey that the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate intercepted signals on an imminent coup passed on to loyal Turkish operatives.The intercepted plans revealed several helicopters with commandos were on the way to Marmaris\'s coastal resort, where Erdoğan stayed, capturing or killing him.Pre-warned, Erdoğan left quickly to avoid them.\n\nAn extensive purge of the Turkish civil service began in the wake of the coup attempt, with President Erdoğan warning his opponents that ""they will pay a heavy price for this.""The New York Times along with some other Western media such as The Economist, described the purges as a ""counter-coup"", with the Times expecting the president to ""become more vengeful and obsessed with control than ever, exploiting the crisis not just to punish mutinous soldiers but to further quash whatever dissent is left in Turkey,"".As of 20 July 2016, the purge already had seen over 45,000 military officials, police officers, judges, governors and civil servants arrested or suspended, including 2,700 judges, 15,000 teachers, and every university dean in the country.\n\n163 generals and admirals were detained, around 45% of the Turkish military\'s total.\n\nOn 18 July 2016, United States State Secretary John Kerry urged Turkish authorities to halt the increasing crackdown on its citizens, indicating that the crackdown was meant to ""suppress dissent.""French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault voiced concern, warning against a ""political system which turns away from democracy"" in response to the purges.\n\nOn 17 August 2016, Turkey started releasing what was expected to eventually amount to about 38,000 prison inmates, to make more space in the penal system for detainees, numbering about 35,000, who were arrested or detained after being involved in or suspected of association, with the 2016 failed coup.\n\nOn 28 September 2016, Turkish justice minister Bekir Bozdağ said 70,000 people had been processed and 32,000 were formally arrested.\n\nMajor General Cahit Bakir, who commanded Turkish forces under NATO in Afghanistan, and Brigadier General Sener Topuc, responsible for education and aid in Afghanistan, were detained by authorities in Dubai connected with the failed coup.\n\nGeneral Akın Öztürk, former Commander of the Turkish Air Force, was the Turkish military attaché to Israel.He was arrested on charges of having played a leading role in the failed coup.Öztürk has denied the charges.\n\nGeneral Adem Huduti, the commander of the Second Army, positioned along the southern borders with Syria and Iraq, and General Erdal Öztürk, the commander of the 3rd Corps, were also arrested.\n\nRear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been stationed at NATO\'s Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk, Virginia, sought asylum in the United States after being recalled by the Turkish government.\n\nIn July 2018, Istanbul\'s 25th Criminal Court sentenced 72 former soldiers involved in the coup attempt to life in prison.\n\nOn 20 June 2019, a terrorism court in Turkey sentenced 151 people to life in prison, including General Akın Öztürk, former commander of Turkish Air Force and the most senior officer involved in the coup.128 people received ""aggravated life"" sentences, which indicates harsh conditions without parole, for their role in the coup, with another 23 receiving standard life sentences.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom President Erdoğan said as one of the principal conspirators, condemned the coup attempt and denied any role in it.""I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey,"" he said in an emailed statement reported by The New York Times.""Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force.I pray to God for Turkey, Turkish citizens, and all those currently in Turkey that this situation is resolved peacefully and quickly.As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nPresident Erdoğan asked the United States to extradite Gülen: ""I call on you again, after there was a coup attempt.Extradite this man in Pennsylvania to Turkey!If we are strategic partners or model partners, do what is necessary.""Prime Minister Yildirim has threatened war against any country that would support Gülen.Turkish Labor Minister Süleyman Soylu said that ""America is behind the coup.""\n\nRegarding the AKP\'s statement against Gülen, Secretary of State Kerry invited the Turkish government ""to present us with any legitimate evidence that withstands scrutiny,"" before they would accept an extradition request.\n\nOn 15 August 2016, former United States diplomat James Jeffrey, who was the United States ambassador to Turkey from 2008 until 2010 made the following remarks: ""The Gülen movement has some infiltration at the least in the military that I am aware of.They of course had extreme infiltration into the police and judiciary earlier.I saw that when I was in Turkey previously, particularly in the Sledgehammer case, Hakan Fidan case, and the corruption cases in 2013.Obviously, significant segment of Turkey\'s bureaucracy was infiltrated and had their allegiance to a movement.That of course is absolutely unacceptable and extremely dangerous.It likely led to the coup attempt.""\n\nOutside Turkey, in Beringen, Belgium, anti-coup protesters attempted to attack a building owned by the pro-Gülen movement group \'Vuslat\'.The police brought in a water cannon to keep the attackers at bay.In news articles it was stated that the police also protected the houses of Gülen supporters.People advocated on social media to go to Beringen once more, and there was unrest in Heusden-Zolder, elsewhere in Belgium.Furthermore, in Somalia the government ordered ""the total closure of all activities"" of an organization linked to the Gülen movement, and gave its staff seven days to leave the country.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, President Erdoğan said Western countries were ""supporting terrorism"" and the military coup, saying ""I\'m calling on the United States: what kind of strategic partners are we, that you can still host someone whose extradition I have asked for?""\n\nOn 31 January 2017, British Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, Alan Duncan said he believed the Gülen movement was responsible for the coup attempt.Duncan went on saying ""the organization which incorporated itself into the state tried to topple the democratic structure in Turkey"".\n\nIn a speech on 29 July 2016, President Erdoğan said U.S. Central Command chief Joseph Votel was ""siding with coup plotters""; Erdoğan said the United States was protecting Fethullah Gülen, whom the Turkish government blames for the coup attempt.Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim made similar comments.In response, Votel said that the Turkish government\'s statements were ""unfortunate and completely inaccurate"" and expressed concern that the mass arrests and firings of military officers would damage military cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey.Similarly, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said that the Turkish military purges were impairing the fight against ISIS.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, in an escalation of tensions with the United States, Erdoğan questioned Turkey\'s relationship with the United States and criticized the West, saying that ""script"" for the abortive putsch last month was ""written abroad"".Erdoğan stated that he had personally asked Obama to extradite Gülen to Turkey.When the U.S. government replied it would need evidence of the cleric\'s guilt before extradition, to which Erdoğan said: ""When you asked for the return of a terrorist, we did not ask for documentation. ...Let us put him on trial.""\n\nYeni Şafak daily, a Turkish pro-state newspaper, stated that the former commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, now-retired United States Army General John F. Campbell, was the ""mastermind"" behind the coup attempt in Turkey.Campbell called the statement ""absolutely ridiculous"" and President Obama said ""Any reports that we had any previous knowledge of a coup attempt, that there was any U.S. involvement in it, that we were anything other than entirely supportive of Turkish democracy are completely false, unequivocally false.""\n\nOn 1 December 2017, Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for American political analyst, former CIA official and former vice chairman of US National Intelligence Council Graham Fuller, stating his involvement in the coup.A career US State Department official who was once CIA Station Chief in Kabul and later went on to be a political scientist in Rand Corporation specializing in the Middle East, Turkish authorities said Fuller attended a meeting in Istanbul on 15 July 2016 involving organization and coordination of the botched coup.Another American among the attendance, as stated by the Turkish prosecutors, was academic Henri Barkey who was named a suspect a week after the failed coup.\n\nThe U.S. consulate in Turkey issued an advisory to U.S. citizens to avoid the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey, which houses about 50 nuclear bombs, until ""normal operations have been restored"".They stated that local authorities were denying access to the air base and that power supplying the air base was shut off.\n\nThe Incirlik base is important to the U.S.-led effort in Syria to combat ISIL and other militants.Nearly 1,500 American personnel are housed in the base.\n\nTwenty-four hours after initial reports that the air base was shut down, United States defense department officials confirmed that the base and its airspace had re-opened to military aircraft and that operations by American aircraft will resume.The Turkish commander of the air base, brig.Gen. Bekir Ercan Van was arrested.After the failure of the coup Gen Bekir Ercan Van sought asylum from the U.S., but his request was denied by U.S.\n\nFollowing the failed coup attempt multiple media outlets have published editorials advocating the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Incirlik Air base as Turkey is unstable.\n\nOn 16 July, anti-coup protesters chanted against locals in areas of Istanbul with high concentration of Alevis, including Okmeydanı and Gazi.Such incidents also occurred in a quarter of Antakya with a high Alevi population, where a motorcyclist stating to be a sharia advocate was lynched.In a neighbourhood of Ankara, shops belonging to Syrians were attacked by a mob.In Malatya, Sunni Islamists harassed residents of an Alevi neighbourhood, particularly the women, and attempted to enter the neighbourhood en masse.Police intervened and blocked all roads leading there.In Kadıköy, people drinking alcohol in public were attacked by a group of religious fundamentalists.\n\nFollowing the arrests, thousands of anti-coup protesters demanded instituting the death penalty against detainees connected with the coup, chanting ""we want the death penalty"".President Erdoğan has been open to reinstituting the death penalty, noting that ""in a democracy, whatever the people want they will get.""Turkish authorities have not executed anyone since 1984, but legally abolished capital punishment only in 2004 as a pre-condition to join the European Union.\n\nEuropean Union officials have been vocal about their opposition to purges by Turkish authorities in connection to the coup.French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that Turkey must work within the framework of the law to uphold Europe\'s democratic principles.Furthermore, on 18 July 2016, Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of Foreign Affairs of the European Union, announced that no country will be admitted into the European Union ""if it introduces the death penalty"".Moreover, German press secretary, Steffen Seibert, stated that reinstituting the death penalty will end Turkey\'s accession talks with the European Union.\n\nTurkey is a member of the Council of Europe, and ratified the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) as part of its terms of membership.The ECHR is an international treaty that includes the abolition of the death penalty among its terms.As such, Turkey is legally bound not to reintroduce the death penalty.\n\nOn 20 July 2016, President Erdoğan announced a three-month state of emergency in response to the attempted coup, invoking Article 120 of the Constitution of Turkey (""Declaration of state of emergency because of widespread acts of violence and serious deterioration of public order"").Under the state of emergency, under Article 121, ""the Council of Ministers, meeting under the chairpersonship of the President of the Republic, may issue decrees having the force of law on matters necessitated by the state of emergency"", with decrees subject to subsequent parliamentary approval.The state of emergency was endorsed by the Parliament on 21 July by 346 votes to 115.The Justice and Development Party and the Nationalist Movement Party supported the state of emergency, whilst the Republican People\'s Party and the Peoples\' Democratic Party opposed it.Prime Minister Yıldırım said at the Parliament that the state of emergency was necessary to ""get rid of this scourge rapidly"".\n\nAs part of the state of emergency, deputy prime minister Kurtulmuş announced that Turkey was temporarily suspending part of the European Convention on Human Rights following the attempted coup, invoking Article 15 of the Convention (""war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation"").The suspensions must be notified to the Council of Europe and may not affect the right to a fair trial or the prohibition on torture.\n\nThis state of emergency in Turkey as well as the hindrance of the right to protest that occurred within such framework have been layered onto a longer history of emergency rules, oppressive legislation and daily government practice that have reinforced both.We can see from this the ""autocratisation"" process in Turkey has thrived of existing legal framework deeply associated in legacies of past ""emergencies"".\n\nOn 3 October 2016 Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş declared the governments intention to extend the state of emergency by a further three months raising objections from both the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) and Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) were critical of the governments use of their emergency powers and declared that they would vote against an extension.\n\nFollowing the National Security Council\'s recommendation for the extension President Erdoğan stated that it was possible that the state of emergency could last for longer than a year prompting outcry from the opposition, Leader of the Main Opposition Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu said that ""The president saying that the state of emergency can last longer than 12 months is strengthening the fear of a counter-coup"" and that it was ""raising the prospect of opportunist measures.""\n\nThe AKP\'s governmental majority allowed the three-month extension to take effect on 19 October 2016.The two-year-long state of emergency was ended on 19 July 2018.\n\nOn 16 July 2016, the media reported that eight Turkish military personnel of various ranks had landed in Greece\'s northeastern city of Alexandroupolis on board a Black Hawk helicopter and claimed political asylum in Greece.While the Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu demanded extradition of ""the eight traitors as soon as possible"", the Greek authorities stated: ""We will follow the procedures of international law.However, we give severe considerations to the fact that [the Turkish military men] are accused, in their own country, of violating the constitutional order and trying to overthrow democracy.""The helicopter was returned to Turkey shortly thereafter.The eight asylum seekers, their asylum case pending, were later transferred to Athens, mainly for safety reasons.On 26 January, the Supreme Court of Greece eventually ruled against their extradition, on the grounds that the eight were unlikely to face a fair trial if returned to their home country and due to concerns over their safety.\n\nOn 15 February 2017, five Turkish commandos illegally entered Greece through the Evros river.However, once they entered the country, the group split.The two of them surrendered to the police and on 20 February 2017, requested political asylum.They were being held in the city of Alexandroupolis.The two men belonged to the Turkish navy.The names given by the two reportedly match the names of two fugitives wanted in relation to the shadowy operation against Erdoğan himself.The Greek government mentioned that the Greek authorities will not allow the country to be dragged into the ongoing feud between the Turkish state and the followers of Gulen.But there were no sign of the other three.According to a lawyer there were indications that the other three have been arrested by Greek authorities who were about to expel them to Turkey.According to new evidence and new information these three ""arrested"" marines were delivered under fast and informal procedures from Greek to Turkish services.\n\nAfter the coup attempt, two Turkish military attachés in Athens, Staff Col. İlhan Yaşıtlı and naval attaché Col. Halis Tunç, had reportedly disappeared along with their families.The Greek foreign ministry canceled the two attachés\' accreditations on 7 August 2016, upon the request of the Turkish foreign ministry.Greek media reported that they might have fled to Italy.On 11 August 2016, the Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu confirmed the reports saying that they had left Greece for Italy on 6 August and adding that Turkey would officially ask the Italian authorities to extradite the two soldiers.\n\nOn 9 August 2016, the media reported that Turkey\'s Rear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been on a United States-based assignment for NATO and after the coup was subject to a detention order in Turkey, had sought asylum in the United States.\n\nIn mid-November 2016, it was officially confirmed that about 40 Turkish military servicemen of various ranks stationed at NATO command structures had applied for asylum in Germany and Belgium.\n\nIn January 2017, Der Spiegel magazine and ARD broadcaster reported that about 40 mostly high-ranking Turkish soldiers who worked at NATO facilities in Germany requested asylum in Germany.\n\nAt the end of February 2017, Germany said it had received 136 asylum requests from Turks holding diplomatic passports since the July coup attempt.The figure was a total for August 2016 to January 2017; some were presumed to be military officers posted to NATO bases in Germany.\n\nIn November 2016, NATO\'s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that Turkish NATO Officers had requested asylum in the countries where they had been posted.He did not name the nations involved or the number of officers, saying it was a matter for those countries to decide.He said: ""Some Turkish officers working in NATO command structure ... have requested asylum in the countries where they are working. ...As always, this is an issue that is going to be assessed and decided by the different NATO allies as a national issue.""\n\nAs of March 2017, Norway have granted asylum for four Turkish soldiers and a military attache.\n\nSeveral Turkish citizens with diplomatic passports have sought political asylum in Switzerland.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, detainees in Turkey have been denied access to legal counsel, have been beaten and tortured.They have not been provided with adequate food, water, or medical care.At least one has attempted suicide.Amnesty International wanted the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture to send people to check on detainees conditions.A person who had been on duty at the Ankara police headquarters said that police denied medical treatment to a detainee.""Let him die.We will say he came to us dead,"" the witness quoted a police doctor as saying.\n\nAlso, Erdoğan has extended the maximum period of detention for suspects from four days to 30, a move Amnesty said increased the risk of torture or other maltreatment of detainees.\n\nTurkish Justice Ministry denied the reports and the Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said on his Twitter account: ""There has not been any torture or assault of detainees in custody,"" in response to reports by Amnesty International.""The claims of torture and assault make up a pre-packaged misinformation campaign formed by members of FETÖ, one which is untrue and distorted,""\n\nOn 7 August, between three and five million people gathered for an anti-coup rally organized by the Turkish authorities in Istanbul.President Erdoğan and the two leaders of the major opposition parties (the Republican People\'s Party and the Nationalist Movement Party) were present.\n\nGreek authorities on several Aegean islands have called for emergency measures to curtail a growing flow of refugees from Turkey; the number of migrants and refugees willing to make the journey across the Aegean has increased noticeably after the failed coup.At Athens officials voiced worries because Turkish monitors overseeing the deal in Greece had been abruptly pulled out after the failed coup without being replaced.Also, the mayor of Kos expressed concern in a letter to the Greek Prime Minister citing the growing influx of refugees and migrants after the failed coup.The Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises (SETE) warned about the prospect of another flare-up in the refugee/migrant crisis due to the Turkish political instability.\n\nVincent Cochetel, the director of the Europe Bureau of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in August 2016 that parts of the EU-Turkey deal about immigration were already de facto suspended because no Turkish police were present at Greek detention centres to oversee deportations.\n\nOn 25 August 2016, seven Turkish citizens sought asylum in Greece.Two were university professors, and their two children applied for asylum in Alexandroupoli after they illegally entered the country from the northeastern border.Also, three businessmen illegally reached the Greek island of Rhodes, and they also applied for asylum.\n\nOn 30 August 2016, a Turkish judge arrived at the Greek island of Chios on a migrant boat, with six Syrian nationals, and sought asylum in the country.He told the Greek coastguard and police officers that he is being persecuted in Turkey for his political beliefs by President Tayyip Erdoğan.The Turkish judge had been arrested for illegally entering the country and was transferred to Athens for his asylum proceedings.The Syrian nationals claimed refugee status.\n\nOn 11 September 2016, four Turkish civilians were arrested by Turkish police.An academic and a teacher attempted to escape to Greece illegally by crossing the Evros river, and the other two because they organized the escape attempt.The academic and the teacher paid a total of 12,500 euros in Istanbul to arrange their escape to Greece.Before their attempt, both the academic and the teacher were suspended from their duties as part of the ongoing probe into the failed coup attempt.Police also seized an air raft, an oar and a pump while detaining the suspects.The court later ordered the two\'s release while the other two suspects, who organized the escape attempt, were arrested.\n\nOn 21 September 2016, ten Turkish civilians, two men, two women and six children landed by boat illegally on the Greek island of Rhodes and sought asylum.They told the Greek authorities they were working in the private sector in Turkey and the Turkish government was persecuting them due to their political beliefs.\n\nOn 29 September 2016, five Turkish nationals, a couple and their child and two other men, arrived in Greece, at Alexandroupolis by crossing the Evros River by boat illegally and requested political asylum.\n\nOn 12 December 2016, one female Turkish national, landed by boat, full of refugees and immigrants, illegally on the Greek island of Lesbos.She requested political asylum.\n\nOn 24 October 2017, Turkish authorities obtained information that 995 Turks have applied for asylum in Greece after the coup attempt.\n\nMore than 1,800 Turkish citizens requested asylum in Greece in 2017.\n\nOn 18 February 2018, seventeen Turkish nationals, including six children, requested asylum in Greece at Oinousses island.\n\nIn August 2018, the former lawmaker for the Peoples\' Democratic Party, Leyla Birlik, requested asylum in Greece after illegally crossing the border near Alexandroupolis.\n\nBerlin mayor, Michael Müller (SPD), said Turkey was waging war on supporters of the Gülen movement in Germany.He said that Turkish officials had approached him and asked him whether he would be prepared to confront the Gülen movement in Berlin critically and, if necessary, to support measures against it.The mayor rejected the idea and made it very clear that Turkish conflicts could not be waged in the city.\n\nDer Spiegel presented classified documents, which showed that Turkey\'s secret service (MIT) had asked Germany\'s foreign intelligence agency (BND) for help in rounding up Gülen supporters in Germany.The Turkish secret service wanted the BND to use its influence to spur German lawmakers into taking action against Gülen supporters and extraditing them to Turkey.Also, Turkey\'s government has sent German authorities requests for searches and extraditions linked to supporters of Fethullah Gülen in Germany.\n\nIn Germany businesses thought to be in support of the Gülen movement have been harassed by Erdoğan supporters.\n\nAfter the failed coup, there was a massive demonstration in Cologne at Germany, in late July, in support of Turkish President Erdoğan.Erdoğan wanted to address the participants via video but was rejected by the local authorities and the German Constitutional Court due to security concerns.Turkey said that the ban was unacceptable and a violation of freedom of expression.\n\nGerman authorities said Turkish mosques in Germany were playing Turkish politics and worried that Turkey\'s internal politics spilled over into German cities.For years, German authorities had encouraged Turkey\'s state-run religious institution Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs usually referred to as DİTİB to provide Islamic preachers and teachers and Gülen Movement Schools for the large Turkish diaspora in Germany.DİTİB manages some 900 mosques in Germany.Gülen movement runs 100 educational facilities in Germany.\n\nAfter the failed coup DİTİB published a sermon praising ""our noble nation"" for rising against ""a wretched network"" that had sown ""seeds of sedition, rebellion and hostility.""According to Volker Beck, a member of the center-left Greens in Germany\'s Bundestag, ""That was not a religious text.It was a declaration of obedience to Mr. Erdoğan and his measures since the coup attempt,"" Volker Kauder, parliamentary group leader of the Germany\'s ruling Christian Democrats, the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU)/Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) faction, said Turkish-Germans should be loyal to Germany first and foremost.\n\nGermans of Turkish origin are being pressured in Germany by informers and officers of Turkey\'s MIT spy agency.According to reports Turkey had 6,000 informants plus MIT officers in Germany who were putting pressure on ""German Turks"".Hans-Christian Ströbele said that there was an ""unbelievable"" level of ""secret activities"" in Germany by Turkey\'s MIT agency.According to Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, not even the former communist East German Stasi secret police had managed to run such a large ""army of agents"" in the former West Germany: ""Here, it\'s not just about intelligence gathering, but increasingly about intelligence service repression.""\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nGermany\'s Office for Migration and Refugees said on 18 November 2016, it had received 4,437 political asylum requests from Turkish citizens up to October, compared to 1,767 for the whole of last year.""We must expect that the number of Turks who are seeking political asylum in Germany will continue to rise,"" said Stephan Mayer, the domestic policy speaker of the union coalition in the Bundestag.\n\nOn 10 December 2016, eleven Turkish nationals, 10 adults and one child, in a martial arts group have applied for asylum in Germany.\n\nAs of January 2018, Germany was first place and Greece second as EU destinations of choice for Turkish nationals requesting asylum after the coup attempt.\n\nTurkish police have carried out simultaneous raids in 18 cities against companies associated with United States-based Fethullah Gülen.The state-run Anadolu Agency said police searched 204 premises and detained 187 businessmen for ""membership in a terror organization"" and ""providing financial support to a terror organization"".All suspects\' assets were seized.\n\nWikiLeaks released Turkish emails and documents to respond to the Turkish government\'s purges that followed the coup attempt.In turn, the Turkish Telecommunications Communications Board blocked access to the WikiLeaks website.On 17 July 2016 Wikileaks had announced on Twitter, the leak of approximately 300,000 emails and over 500,000 documents, including those to and from AKP.\n\nWikiLeaks stated that it was attacked shortly after 17 July announcement of the planned publication and hypothesized that Turkish authorities were responsible.WikiLeaks stated in a tweet, ""our infrastructure is under sustained attack.""Tweets from WikiLeaks include ""We are unsure of the true origin of the attack.The timing suggests a Turkish state power faction or its allies.We will prevail & publish.""and: ""Turks will likely be censored to prevent them reading our pending release of 100k+ docs on politics leading up to the coup."", ""We ask that Turks are ready with censorship bypassing systems such as TorBrowser and uTorrent""; ""And that everyone else is ready to help them bypass censorship and push our links through the censorship to come.""\n\nUpon the release of the email dump, it has been reported that the emails contain little to no damning information, and instead are just mails from a public mailing list, but also linked externally to ""voter information on all of the women registered to vote in 78 out of Turkey\'s 81 provinces"".\n\nSeveral places were renamed to commemorate the failed coup: Boğaziçi Köprüsü (Bosphorus Bridge) → 15 Temmuz Şehitler Köprüsü Kızılay Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Kızılay Demokrasi Meydanı Ahmet Taner Kışlalı Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Milli İrade Meydanı (Reverted to original name a few days later) Büyük İstanbul Otogarı → İstanbul 15 Temmuz Demokrasi Otogarı In TRT, Yeni Haber Stüdyosu → 15 Temmuz Millet Stüdyosu Kazan → Kahramankazan about the province\'s local people\'s resistance to the coup plotters.Kahraman means ""hero"" in Turkish Niğde University → Niğde Ömer Halisdemir University\n\nIn 2018, the Istanbul Municipal Council decided to change the names of a total of 90 streets that included words which could be associated with FETÖ.\n\nThe Presidency of Religious Affairs stated that it would not be providing religious funeral services to the dead coupists, except for ""privates and low-ranking officers compelled by force and threats who found themselves in the midst of the conflict without full knowledge of anything"".\n\nA document dated 26 September 2016 showed that Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) asked Turkish missions and religious representatives abroad to profile Gülen movement expatriates living in their respective foreign countries.Gülen-linked schools, businesses, foundations, associations, media outlets and others were also included in the reports.Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs has gathered intelligence via imams from 38 countries.\n\nBelgium officials said they would withdraw recognition of Diyanet mosques in the country if necessary.\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nOn 21 December 2016, the Turkish government has recalled Yusuf Acar, the religious affairs attaché of the Turkish Embassy in the Netherlands, after Dutch authorities said he was spying.Acar collected information of people who sympathize with Fethullah Gülen at Netherlands and passed it on to the Turkish authorities.The Dutch government called spying activities an ""unwanted and non-acceptable interference in the lives of Dutch citizens.""and the attaché was reportedly declared persona non grata and received a ""deportation warning"" by Dutch authorities.\n\nOn 26 January 2017, President Erdoğan, during his visit to Tanzania, asked his Tanzanian counterpart John Magufuli to take action against the network of Fethullah Gülen.\n\nIn April 2017 it was announced that President Erdoğan planned to establish a purpose-built museum dedicated to the coup events, called the ""Museum of the 15 July: Martyrs and Democracy"", to be located in Kahramankazan, a town near Ankara.Paid for by Turkish Ministry of Culture funds, it is planned to open at the end of 2018.The museum opened in December 2019\n\nAmong the Turkish opposition parties, the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) issued a statement expressing their public opposition to the coup, and the Hürriyet Daily News reported that Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bahçeli telephoned Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım to express his opposition to the coup.The co-chairs of the opposition Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) issued a statement saying that the party was ""under all circumstances and as a matter of principle against all kinds of coup.""Amongst the minor parties, left-wing nationalist Patriotic Party\'s Doğu Perinçek backed democracy, when he held Gülen and the Americans responsible.Kurdish militant separatist organization Kurdistan Workers\' Party, which Turkey and its allies label as a terrorist organization, urged their supporters to stay away from the coup and rather defend their people, while the Communist Party called upon the people to overthrow the AKP government which they called an ""enemy of humanity"".\n\nDuring the first hours of the coup plotters\' moves of blocking Istanbul\'s bridges and flying fighter jets low over Istanbul and Ankara, Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjørn Jagland tweeted against the coup attempt and underlined that ""any attempt to overthrow the democratically elected leaders is unacceptable"".\n\nRussia\'s President Vladimir Putin called Erdoğan out of solidarity before all NATO member countries\' heads following the coup attempt.Erdoğan thanked the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev – who was the first president to show solidarity after the coup attempt – for his support in solving the 7-month crisis over downed Russian Sukhoi Su-24 and the Prime Minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, who was among the first NATO country leaders to condemn the coup attempt, already from the early hours of Saturday.\n\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the then prime minister of Pakistan, was all praise for the people of Turkey and the AKP government and strongly condemned what he termed as an attempt to undermine democracy in Turkey.""We deeply admire the resolve of the brave and resilient Turkish people, who stood up against the forces of darkness and anarchy to express their support and commitment to democracy,"" the PM said in a statement issued from his office.\n\nThe majority of countries either expressed their support for the government or called for restraint.On 16 July 2016, however, a proposed United Nations Security Council statement denouncing the coup was not accepted by Egypt, a non-permanent member of the Council at the time, due to textual disagreements.Egyptian diplomats said that the council is ""in no position to qualify, or label [the Turkish] government – or any other government for that matter – as democratically elected or not"".Objection by the United States and the UK – permanent members of the Security Council – led to Egypt proposing a new statement calling for all sides to ""respect the democratic and constitutional principles and the rule of law"", which was rejected, preventing the condemnation of the coup attempt by the Security Council.The leader of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky supported the coup attempt.\n\nAl-Monitor reported that ""Unlike Ankara\'s Western allies, Iran did not wait for the coup\'s failure to speak up.Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif voiced support for democracy in a Twitter message in the early hours of the unrest, writing ""Stability, and democracy in Turkey are paramount"".In a subsequent phone call after the failure of the coup attempt, President Hassan Rouhani told Erdoğan the coup attempt was ""a test to identify your domestic and foreign friends and enemies.""An Iranian official pointed out parallels between the coup attempt in Turkey and the coup against Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mussadiq in 1953: ""What we know is that this attempt was triggered by foreign hands.We have experienced the same thing in the past.Since Mr. Erdogan wants to play a more positive path in the region today, they want to overthrow him.""\n\nMustafa Akıncı, President of Northern Cyprus, welcomed the fact that ""no community in Turkey ... applauded the coup as they have done in the past.""Azerbaijan strongly condemned the attempted military coup in Turkey and considered such actions unacceptable according to a statement from Novruz Mammadov, deputy head of the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration and chief of the foreign relations department.\n\nEuropean Commissioner dealing with Turkey\'s EU membership bid, Johannes Hahn, said it appears Turkey\'s government prepared arrest lists of political opponents before the coup attempt and had been waiting for the right time to act.In this sense, EU reported that as a main criticism to put this issue in the category of terrorism become the violation of the fundamental rights and fundamental values of the citizens.Hence, it underlines a total divergence of opinions and mentality between EU and Turkey which reached a deadlock here especially after the 15th of July in 2016.\n\nOn 19 July 2016, White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said during a press briefing that President Barack Obama has held a phone conversation with President Erdoğan: ""The President used the phone call to reiterate once again the strong commitment of the United States to the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey.The President pledged any needed assistance to the Turkish government as they conduct an investigation to determine exactly what happened.""\n\nOn 20 July 2016, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""Turkey has a large armed force, professional armed forces and ...I am certain they will continue as a committed and strong NATO ally.""On a statement released on 10 August 2016, the Secretary General once more strongly condemned the attempted coup and reiterated full support for Turkey\'s democratic institutions.He also expressed support for the elected Turkish government and respect for the courage of the Turkish people for resisting the coup plotters.\n\nOn 29 July 2016, the commander of U.S. Central Command, General Joseph Votel, denied statements by Turkey\'s president Erdoğan that he has supported the coup attempt in Turkey.\n\nOn 1 August 2016, United States Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, General Joseph Dunford, visited Turkey and condemned the coup attempt.Dunford said: ""The consistent theme throughout the day was a reaffirmation of the importance of the U.S.-Turkey relationship – the need for us to cooperate.""\n\nOn July, 20, there were reports that a group of Turkish military commandos coup fugitives would try to cross from Turkey to the island of Symi, in the southeastern Aegean, at Greece.The Hellenic Coast Guard was on alert and increased the patrols in the area, especially after a group of inflatable dinghies and other vessels were seen departing from Datça, on the Turkish coast, in the direction of Symi, they monitored the movements of the Turkish vessels, which remained in Turkish waters.Furthermore, a contingent of the Hellenic Police was dispatched to Symi to conduct checks there.The Greek government had been anticipating a possible attempt by participants in the failed coup to come to Greece and took the reports seriously.Turkish F-16 fighter jets were also scrambled to check reports that missing Turkish coast guard vessels had appeared in Greek waters in the Aegean.Later on the day, the Turkish interior ministry denied reports that rebel soldiers might have ""hijacked"" a vessel to flee to Greece.The Greek armed forces remained on alert the throughout the day for potential coup fugitives.\n\nAccording to Michael Rubin, from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Erdoğan had himself to blame for the coup.Following an increasingly Islamist agenda, Erdoğan had reportedly ""dropped any pretense of governing for all Turks.""After ""fanning the flames"" at the 2013 Gezi Park protests, he transformed the predominantly Kurdish-inhabited areas of southeastern Turkey ""into a war zone reminiscent of the worst days of the 1980s.""The biggest problem, according to Rubin, might have been Erdoğan\'s foreign policy, which managed to turn the initial ""no problems with neighbors"" doctrine into a situation where the country has problems with almost every neighbor and has even alienated some of its allies and friends.Rubin previously worked as an official at the Pentagon and less than 4 months before the coup, he wrote an article in Newsweek magazine titled, ""Will There Be a Coup Against Erdogan in Turkey?""\n\nBritish Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk warned that ""too late did Erdoğan realize the cost of the role he had chosen for his country.It\'s one thing to say sorry to Putin and patch up relations with Netanyahu; but when you can no longer trust your army, there are more serious matters to concentrate upon.""Even if this coup may have failed, Fisk expected another to follow in the months or years to come.\n\nTurkish professor Akın Ünver described the coup d\'état attempt as ""more of a mutiny"".\n\nThe name of the ""Peace at Home Council"" – Yurtta Sulh Konseyi – is derived from Atatürk\'s famous saying \'Peace at Home, Peace in the World\'.Journalist Ezgi Başaran said that ""the statement of the junta, that was [...] read on the [...] government TV [channel] as the coup got under way, bore a strong resemblance to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk\'s famous address to the Turkish Youth.[...] On the other hand, given that these references are too obvious, they may have been intentionally included to insinuate a Kemalist junta rather than a Gülenist one.""\n\nThe citizen journalism site Bellingcat published an analysis of the messages of a WhatsApp group consisting of high-ranking military officials who had taken part in the coup covering their activities including them killing several people.The messages were cross referenced with video footage.The group was named ""Yurtta sulh"" which refers to a peace at home speech and they seem secular and military with no references to Gülen or anything related during the several hours of messaging.\n\nNews reports have suggested that the coup ringleader was Adil Öksüz.Some believe Öksüz to have been an operative with Turkish intelligence.\n\nGerman Islamic studies scholar said the putschists tried to forestall a large-scale purge of judiciary and military, the implementation of which had already started on Saturday, the day after the coup attempt.According to Turkish investigative journalist Ahmet Şık, a list of officials to be purged had been ready compiled by the attorney-general of Izmir, Okan Bato, and was approved by President Erdoğan.According to this version, the putschists had to quickly bring forward their coup attempt before being disposed and arrested.\n\nDuring and after the events, several politicians and commentators suggested that the government knew about the coup in advance and possibly directed it.The facts that the coup attempt began in the evening rather than at a more inconspicuous time and that the events were largely confined to Ankara and Istanbul contributed to doubts about the authenticity of the coup attempt.Journalists and opposition politicians branded it a \'tragic comedy\' and \'theatre play\'.Advocates of such theories pointed to how Erdoğan stood to gain from the coup attempt in terms of increasing his popularity and support for his calls for an executive presidency, while being able to legitimize further crackdowns on judicial independence and the opposition in general.\n\nOther elements that were reported to support the theory included: no list of demands by the coup plotters, the organization and response of the police, the long lists of arrests that seemed to be ready surprisingly quickly (including arrests of 2,745 judges and 2,839 soldiers), and the obvious nature of the coup actions.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom Erdoğan had said as being one of the principal conspirators, commented, ""I don\'t believe that the world believes the accusations made by President Erdoğan.There is a possibility that it could be a staged coup and it could be meant for further accusations [against the Gülenists].""Journalist Cengiz Çandar, a veteran observer of Turkey\'s coups, said ""I have never seen any with this magnitude of such inexplicable sloppiness.""Prominent Hizmet (Gülen movement) spokesman Alp Aslandogan said, referencing that the Turkish Air Force commander met with Erdoğan before 15 July, that certain legal documentation related to the coup seemed written beforehand, arguing that within ""the indictment written by a prosecutor on the night of 15 July to 16 July, there were events there that didn\'t actually happen.Some events did happen, but those events didn\'t happen by the time the document started.It looks like a bigger plan was there, and part of the plan did not come to pass.""\n\nThe organization and spontaneous synchronization by large numbers of mosques was perceived to be unachievable unless there had been prior preparation, with journalists also pointing to how Erdoğan could have strategically used the call to prayer to invoke religious sentiment in a political situation as a veiled attack on state secularism.\n\nThousands of arrests and purges were conducted by Turkish authorities between 16 and 18 July 2016.The sheer number of these arrests made at such a speed could only be done so if the ""Turkish government had all those lists ready"", as suggested by Johannes Hahn, European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, on 18 July 2016.Hahn also said that because these lists were already available immediately after the coup, the ""event was prepared"" and the lists were to be used ""at a certain stage"".\n\nMehmet Dişli, who was seen giving orders to the coup plotters and who was the one who put a belt around Hulusi Akar\'s neck to make him sign, is the brother of Şaban Dişli, a former vice president of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and confidant of Erdoğan.\n\nSeveral social media users have compared the coup attempt to the Reichstag fire in 1933, which Adolf Hitler used as an excuse to suspend civil liberties and order mass arrests of his opponents.Politico correspondent Ryan Heath said that ""the coup was staged to allow Erdoğan to purge the military of opponents and increase his grip on the country"".Heath used Twitter to share comments from his Turkish source, who called the events of Friday night a ""fake coup"" which would help a ""fake democracy warrior"" (referring to Erdoğan).The source said: ""Probably we\'ll see an early election [in] which he\'ll try to guarantee an unbelievable majority of the votes.And this will probably guarantee another 10–15 years of authoritarian, elected dictatorship.""\n\nThe New York Times reported that some Turkish citizens believed the coup attempt was staged by Erdoğan to improve his public image and popularity, while cracking down on political opponents and expanding his power.Critics found it suspect that reportedly no government officials were arrested or harmed during the attempted coup, which—among other factors—raised the suspicion of a false flag event staged by the Turkish government to crack down on opposition parties.Those in Turkey suggesting that the coup was staged are also being questioned by the government.\n\nPoliticians and journalists who were skeptical of the authenticity of the coup plot said that in reality, a \'civil coup\' had effectively been staged against the Armed Forces and Judiciary, both of which were extensively purged of stated Gülen supporters by the government shortly after the events.Skeptics said that the coup would be used as an excuse for further erosion of judicial independence and a crackdown on the opposition, giving the AKP greater and unstoppable power over all state institutions and paving the way for a more radical Islamist agenda at odds with the founding principles of the Turkish Republic.\n\nJustice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said in late July 2016 that Turkish social media users who said the government was staging the coup faced investigation: ""Just look at the people who are saying on social media that this was theatre.Public prosecutors are already investigating them.Most of them are losers who think it is an honor to die for Fethullah Gülen\'s command.""\n\nOn 12 July 2017, Stockholm Center for Freedom, a monitoring group with reported links to the Gülen movement, published a controversial report stating that President Erdogan orchestrated the coup bid as a false flag to consolidate his powers, set up his opposition for a mass persecution, and push Turkish Armed Forces into a military incursion into Syria.According to the report, it uncovered new evidence from 11 July 2016, four days before the planned coup bid, that a secret plan was circulated among select group of Armed Forces to give an appearance of a coup attempt.The plan was sanctioned by intelligence and military chiefs with the approval of Erdogan.\n\nIn early November 2017, Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for , former Director of the Middle East Program of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, stating that he is an agent of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), that he was present in Istanbul during the 2016 Turkish coup attempt, and that he was one of the key organizers behind the coup attempt.Around 1 December, the Istanbul prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for Graham E. Fuller, an American author and political analyst specializing in Islamic extremism after a long CIA career and holding the role of vice-chair of the United States National Intelligence Council.The prosecutor\'s office based the warrant on suspicion of Fuller helping to plan the coup attempt.Hürriyet stated that Turkish authorities believed that they had traced Fuller\'s location before the attempted coup and afterward when he left Turkey.\n\nBarkey denied his reported role in the coup, describing the claims as ""so ludicrous that they do not even deserve the term \'science fiction\'.""\n\nDeep state in Turkey The Imam\'s Army List of coups and coup attempts since 2010 List of modern conflicts in the Middle East List of attacks on legislatures\n', 'Claim_Context': 'In March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.

117,"{'Wiki_Title': '2016 Turkish coup attempt', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'On 15 July 2016, a faction within the Turkish Armed Forces, organized as the Peace at Home Council, attempted a coup d\'état against state institutions, including the government and president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.They attempted to seize control of several places in Ankara, Istanbul, Marmaris and elsewhere, such as the Asian side entrance of the Bosphorus Bridge, but failed to do so after forces and civilians loyal to the state defeated them.The Council cited an erosion of secularism, elimination of democratic rule, disregard for human rights, and Turkey\'s loss of credibility in the international arena as reasons for the coup.The government said it had evidence the coup leaders were linked to the Gülen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the Republic of Turkey and led by Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish businessman and a well-known Islamic scholar who lives in exile in Pennsylvania.The Turkish government alleged that Gülen was behind the coup (which Gülen denied) and that the United States was harboring him.Events surrounding the coup attempt and the purges in its aftermath reflect a complex power struggle between Islamist elites in Turkey.\n\nDuring the coup attempt, over 300 people were killed and more than 2,100 were injured.Many government buildings, including the Turkish Parliament and the Presidential Palace, were bombed from the air.Mass arrests followed, with at least 40,000 detained, including at least 10,000 soldiers and 2,745 judges, for being affiliated with the coup attempt.15,000 education staff were also suspended and the licenses of 21,000 teachers working at private institutions were revoked after the government stated they were loyal to Gülen.More than 77,000 people have been arrested and over 160,000 fired from their jobs, on reports of connections to Gülen.\n\nThere were many reactions against the coup attempt, both domestically and internationally.The main opposition parties in Turkey condemned the attempt, while several international leaders—such as those of the United States, NATO, the European Union, and neighboring countries—called for ""respect of the democratic institutions in Turkey and its elected officials.""Many international organizations also opposed the coup.The United Nations Security Council, however, did not denounce the coup after disagreements over the phrasing of a statement.Iran opposed the coup and advised Erdogan to defeat the coup plotters.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the head of United States Central Command, General Joseph Votel, was ""siding with coup plotters"", after Votel criticized the Turkish government for arresting the Pentagon\'s contacts in Turkey.\n\nIn March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.The same month, the British Parliament\'s Foreign Affairs Select Committee said some Gulenists were involved in the coup d\'état attempt but found no hard evidence that Fethullah Gülen masterminded the failed coup and found no evidence to justify the United Kingdom designating the Gülen movement as a ""terrorist organization"".\n\nSince the 1970s, followers of the influential cleric Fethullah Gülen had assumed increasingly important positions within the Turkish state apparatus.Gülen several times advised his followers to take key positions in society and government, if necessary with a secret identity to avoid opposition from the laicistic Turkish army and government.Nevertheless, at the start of the 21st century, Gülen\'s followers achieved crucial positions of power in Turkey (and beyond) with a vast network of newspapers, TV channels, schools, associations, lobby organizations, financial institutions and positions within the state such as the army and the judiciary.Initially, the then Prime Minister Erdogan seemingly tolerated the power of the Gülen movement because of common interests such as limiting the undemocratic political power of the military, but also because of impotence and fear of Gülen\'s power within Turkey.\n\nA series of events eventually led to a rift between Erdogan and Gülen.For example, prosecutors that allegedly were aligned with the Gülen movement tried to arrest the intelligence chief Hakan Fidan for the peace negotiations with the PKK, and by extension PM Erdogan subsequently, as the Turkish secret service is directly subordinate to the prime minister of Turkey.During this period (2010-2013), state secrets were leaked, fraud was committed with the entrance exams for government employees (KPSS), a change of power occurred at the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) and (sex)tapes of both government members and opposition members were leaked.Following these events and other incidents, the Turkish government decided to designate the Gülen movement as parallel state and FETÖ (Fethullahist Terror Organization).Alleged Gülen supporters were fired or arrested.The coup attempt that followed is therefore also described by some analysts as a last desperate attempt by Gülenists to retain power.\n\nIt is widely reported that Kemalist ideology played a huge role in motivating the 15 July 2016 coup attempt, like all previous political interventions in the history of Turkey\'s military coups.Since the establishment of multiparty democracy in Turkey in 1946, the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), together with the judiciary, have viewed themselves as guardians of Kemalist ideals and the secular Turkish nationalist state established under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk against political parties that have promoted a larger role for Islam and minorities in public life.The military and judiciary have regularly intervened in politics to block or ban popular parties representing conservative Muslim Turks, attempting to relax the restrictions on traditional religious practices, such as women\'s wearing of headscarves.The military has toppled four elected governments: by coups in 1960 and 1980, and by military decisions in 1971 and 1997.The military has also banned several major political parties.In 1998, Erdoğan, then-mayor of Istanbul, was banned for life from politics and jailed because he had read a religious poem by Ziya Gökalp several years before, at a public meeting.In 2007, the military expressed its opposition to the election of Abdullah Gül, of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), as president, by issuing an e-memorandum.Still, Gül was eventually elected when the AKP won both a referendum on the matter.Also, a snap election, and the party returned with a larger majority in the parliament.The military cited erosion of secularism as one of the reasons for the coup in the statement published on the day of the coup.\n\nAs opposed to previous political interventions by the Turkish military, Turkey\'s AKP government and pro-state media maintain that the 15 July 2016 coup attempt was not motivated by allegiance to Kemalist ideology, but rather to the vast political, economic, and religious network led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen.Between 2007 and 2012, high-profile Kemalists, including high-ranking officers of the Turkish Armed Forces, faced a series of trials and purges, under reports of involvement in a secret society codenamed ""Ergenekon.""Supported by Islamist (both pro-Gülen and pro-Erdoğan) prosecutors, security officials, and media, the purges allowed lower-rank Islamist officers to assume high-ranking military positions.They were seen as a bid by Turkey\'s civilian leaders under President Erdoğan to establish dominance over the military.In these trials in 2013 – viewed as ""sensational"" and ""one of the biggest in recent Turkish history"" – 275 people, including senior military officers, journalists, lawyers, and academics, were said to be involved in the so-called ""Ergenekon"" conspiracy, reportedly plotting a coup in 2003/04 against then–Prime Minister Erdoğan.Additionally, some military officers were said to be involved in a separate reported plot, Sledgehammer.Simultaneously, Erdoğan promoted lower-ranking officers up the chain of command, ensuring that the military chief of staff was loyal to him and thereby demoralizing the army.\n\nThe AKP\'s alliance with Gülen started to collapse during 2013 as Gülenists targeted the AKP using corruption charges.After the split, Erdoğan decided it would be advantageous to rehabilitate the army.The ""Ergenekon"" convictions were overturned in April 2016 by the Court of Cassation, which ruled that the existence of the network was unproven.\n\nIn 2013, law enforcement efforts to fight corruption, which had led to the 2013 corruption scandal in Turkey, were faulted by Erdoğan.The anti-corruption efforts were a source of tension between the Gülenists and the AKP.In political analysis in the months prior to the coup attempt, the incidence of corruption was reported to be ""rife"" in Turkey.Following the coup attempt, some coup leaders cited corruption as a reason for their actions.\n\nOn 13 July, less than two days before the coup was launched, Erdoğan signed a bill giving Turkish soldiers immunity from prosecution while taking part in domestic operations.The bill requires cases against commanders to be approved by the prime minister, while district governors may sign cases against lower-ranking soldiers.The immunity bill was seen as part of the détente between the government and the armed forces.The latter has increasingly been taking over military operations in Kurdish-inhabited areas from police and paramilitary units.\n\nOn 15 July 2016, as reported just before 23:00 EEST (UTC+3), military jets were spotted flying over Ankara, and both the Fatih Sultan Mehmet and Bosphorus bridges in Istanbul were closed.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said military action was being ""taken outside the chain of command"" and it was an ""illegal attempt"" to seize power by ""part of the military"".He further said that those involved ""will pay the highest price.""Local media also reported tanks in Istanbul\'s Atatürk Airport.It was reported that Internet users within Turkey were blocked from accessing Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.Twitter later stated that it had ""no reason to think we\'ve been fully blocked"".Some hostages were taken at military headquarters, including the Turkish Chief of the General Staff Hulusi Akar.At around 21:00, the coupists had invited Salih Zeki Çolak, the commander of the Turkish Land Forces to the military headquarters.When he arrived, he was immediately apprehended.Abidin Ünal, head of the Turkish Air Force, who had been attending a wedding in Istanbul, was abducted from there by soldiers who descended from a helicopter.The coupists then tried to force Akar to sign the coup declaration, almost strangling him using a belt in the process.He refused and was then taken to the Akıncı Air Base and other commanders at the headquarters.The military also entered the Justice and Development Party\'s offices in Istanbul and asked people to leave.\n\nEarly reports said President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was safe in Marmaris, south-west Turkey, where he had been on holiday.\n\nFrom around 23:00 to midnight, helicopters bombed the police special forces headquarters and police air force headquarters in Gölbaşı, just outside of Ankara.The attacks left 42 dead and 43 injured.Türksat headquarters in Gölbaşı was also attacked, killing two security personnel.\n\nAt around 23:50, soldiers occupied Taksim Square in central Istanbul.\n\nAt 00:02, it was reported by Reuters that soldiers were inside the buildings of the state broadcaster, the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), in Ankara.During the coup attempt, soldiers forced anchor Tijen Karaş to read out a statement saying that ""the democratic and secular rule of law has been eroded by the current government"" and that Turkey was now led by the Peace at Home Council who would ""ensure the safety of the population.""The statement read in part: ""Turkish Armed Forces have completely taken over the administration of the country to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedoms, the rule of law and general security that was damaged.[...] All international agreements are still valid.We hope that all of our good relationships with all countries will continue.""The plotters said they had ""done so to preserve democratic order, and that the rule of law must remain a priority"".The statement also ordered temporary martial law (sıkıyönetim), and said a new constitution would be prepared ""as soon as possible"".TRT was then taken off air.\n\nOther media outlets were also raided by the putschists, such as Turkish newspaper Hürriyet and private broadcaster CNN Türk.\n\nReuters reported on 15 July that an EU source described the coup as ""well orchestrated,"" and predicted that ""given the scale of the operation, it is difficult to imagine they will stop short of prevailing.""Another EU diplomat said that the Turkish ambassador in his capital was shocked and ""taking it very seriously"".\n\nThe Peace at Home Council was reportedly chaired by Muharrem Köse.\n\nAdana: Upon receiving the intelligence that thirty soldiers from the 10th Air Base Command would move to the base where the regional and provincial gendarmerie commands were located, the police prevented the soldiers from leaving the guardhouse with TOMA and armored vehicles and blocked them.Bitlis: In the Tatvan district of Bitlis, on the orders of Brigade Commander Arif Seddar Afşar, helicopters were circulated in the skies of Tatvan and fired at the city.The brigade command left the municipality\'s construction equipment in front of the barracks in case there was a tank operation in the district.Denizli: Approximately five hundred officers and non-commissioned officers who participated in the coup attempt surrendered to the gendarmerie and police forces.They were interrogated at Çardak District Gendarme Command.Kars: With the order of Kars 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, the soldiers who came with tanks and armored personnel carriers surrounded the Police Headquarters building and wanted to detain Faruk Karaduman, the chief of police.At the same hours, the invitation of Deputy Governors, 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, went to the command.Kocaeli: Turkcell\'s data center in Gebze was raided by soldiers who participated in the coup attempt.Soldiers who tried to interrupt the internet service were detained.Malatya: A rebellious soldier opened fire inside a base of the Turkish 2nd Army, damaging six vehicles.The base was besieged by police and loyal soldiers, and the shooter was captured.Marmaris: Three military helicopters carried out a bomb attack on the hotel where Erdoğan was staying.Forty rebellious soldiers of the Special Forces Command clashed with the police in the region.Mersin: Mersin Garrison and Mediterranean Region Commander Admiral Nejat Atilla Demirhan called Mersin Provincial Police Deputy Chief Yakup Usta and Gendarmerie Colonel Mustafa Bakçepınar and stated that the Turkish Armed Forces had taken over the administration.He introduced himself as the martial law garrison commander and ordered Mersin Governor Özdemir Çakacak and district governors to be taken into custody.Demirhan and Dağdelen, who made the same announcement with the police radio obtained from Mersin Police Department, were detained through the operation of the security forces.Sakarya: Sakarya Governorship was captured with armored personnel carriers, military trucks and many military jeeps from the military unit in the Kandıra district of Kocaeli.As a reinforcement, two military vehicles full of soldiers from the Sakarya central division command had to return to their barracks in the face of the resistance of the police and the harsh reaction of the people who took to the streets against the putschists.The vehicles occupying the Sakarya Governorate were seized by the citizens and the soldiers in them were neutralized and handed over to the security forces.Afterwards, citizens and security forces entered the governor\'s office and neutralized the soldiers there and suppressed the uprising in the province.Eight civilian citizens were injured as a result of the fire opened by the military during the incident.Şırnak: Çakırsöğüt Gendarmerie Commando Brigadier General Ali Osman Gürcan and 309 soldiers, that participated in the coup attempt, were detained by the security forces.\n\nTurkey\'s Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım responded to the events by stating that an ""illegal action is taking place outside of the chain of command"".He also said that ""the government elected by the people remains in charge and this government will only go when the people say so.""The Turkish Presidential office said President Erdoğan was on holiday inside Turkey and condemned the coup attempt as an attack on democracy.A presidential source also said Erdoğan and his government were still in power.The first messages from Erdoğan were transmitted at around 00:23At about 01:00, Erdoğan did a FaceTime interview with CNN Türk, in which he called upon his supporters to take to the streets in defiance of the military-imposed curfew, saying ""There is no power higher than the power of the people.Let them do what they will at the public squares and airports.""Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş appeared on live television, saying Turkey\'s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is still in charge of the government.The mayor of Ankara, Melih Gökçek of the AKP, encouraged people to go out to the city\'s streets in defiance, despite a curfew imposed by the military.Erdoğan\'s plane took off from Dalaman Airport near Marmaris at 23:47, but had to wait in the air south of Atatürk for the airport to be secured.His plane landed at 02:50\n\nThe First Army General Command in Istanbul stated in a news conference that the TSK did not support the coup and the perpetrators represented a tiny faction that were on the verge of being brought under control.Istanbul Atatürk Airport was closed; all flights from the airport were cancelled.There was an explosion in the TRT broadcasting headquarters and gunfire was reported in Ankara.Soon after, it was stormed by a crowd of civilians and police, with four soldiers inside reportedly being ""neutralized"".The channel went back on air and Karaş, who had previously announced the coup, said live that she had been held hostage and forced to read the declaration of the coup at gunpoint.\n\nBy 01:00, it was reported that the military had pulled its forces from the Atatürk airport and people were coming inside, but by 01:13, it was reported that tanks were inside the airport and gunfire was heard.\n\nTanks opened fire near the Turkish Parliament Building.The parliamentary building was also hit from the air.Injuries were reported among protesters following gunfire on Bosphorus Bridge.\n\nA helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was shot down by a Turkish military F-16 fighter jet.There were also reports of pro-state jets flying over Ankara to ""neutralize"" helicopters used by those behind the coup.\n\nAt 03:08, a military helicopter opened fire on the Turkish parliament.At 03:10, Turkish Armed Forces stated on their website that they had complete control over the country.At 03:12, Yıldırım made a statement saying that the situation was under control and that a no-fly zone was declared over Ankara and that military planes that still flew would be shot down.\n\nIt was reported that the Turkish parliament had been bombed again at 03:23 and 03:33.A helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was also seen flying by it.Half an hour following the report of 12 deaths and 2 injuries in the parliament, soldiers entered CNN Türk\'s headquarters and forced the studio to go off air.After an hour of interruption by the pro-coup soldiers, CNN Türk resumed its broadcast.Later, İsmail Kahraman said a bomb exploded at a corner of the public relations building inside the parliament, with no deaths but several injuries among police officers.\n\nAt around 04:00 two or three helicopters attacked Erdogan\'s hotel.According to eyewitness accounts, ten to fifteen heavily armed men landed and started firing.In the ensuing conflict, two policemen were killed and 8 were injured.\n\nThe Doğan News Agency reported that in Istanbul several individuals were injured after soldiers fired on a group of people attempting to cross the Bosphorus Bridge in protest of the attempted coup.\n\nOn Saturday 16 July 2016, at 00:42 EEST (UTC+3), a Turkish Black Hawk helicopter sent a distress signal and requested permission from Greek authorities for an emergency landing, and landed eight minutes later (00:50) at the Dimokritos airport in Alexandroupoli, in Greece, while two Greek F-16s observed the procedure and escorted it to the airport.The first reports said that the passengers were seven military personnel and a civilian.Later, it turned out that all were military personnel (two majors, four captains and two non-commissioned officers).They had removed the badges and insignia from their uniforms, making it impossible to know their rank.All were arrested after landing for illegal entry into the country.They were transferred to the local police station, while the Greek authorities at the airport guarded the helicopter.The eight passengers all requested political asylum in Greece as they believed they would not get a fair trial in Turkey.On 21 September 2016, Greece denied three out of the eight asylum.The men\'s lawyer Stavroula Tomara said they would be appealing the decision and said they had the ""impression that the decision has been predetermined, and that the interview was conducted just as a formality.""On 11 October 2016, four more of the eight were denied asylum.Two of the men who had previously been denied asylum applied for a re-evaluation but their applications were also rejected.\n\nAfter Erdoğan flew into Istanbul, he made a televised speech inside the airport at around 04:00, whilst thousands gathered outside.He addressed a crowd of supporters in the airport, at about 06:30 He said, ""In Turkey, armed forces are not governing the state or leading the state.They cannot.""He blamed ""those in Pennsylvania"" (a reference to Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, and his Hizmet Movement) for the coup attempt.Erdoğan also said he had plans to ""clean up"" the army, saying that ""This uprising is a gift from God to us.""State-run Anadolu Agency named former Colonel Muharrem Köse, who in March 2016 was dishonorably discharged for reported association with Gülen, as the suspected leader of the coup.However, the Alliance for Shared Values, a non-profit organization associated with Gülen, released a statement reiterating that it condemns any military intervention in domestic politics, and saying Erdoğan\'s allegations against the movement were ""highly irresponsible"".Gülen himself said in a brief statement just before midnight: ""As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nReuters reported that in early hours of 16 July, the coup appeared to have ""crumbled"" as crowds defied pro-coup military orders and gathered in major squares of Istanbul and Ankara to oppose it.Reuters also reported pro-coup soldiers surrendering to the police in Taksim Square, Istanbul.It was reported that by 05:18, Atatürk airport had completely been recaptured by the government whilst the police had surrounded the coupists inside the Turkish army headquarters, calling for them to surrender.Between 06:00–08:00 a skirmish took place there.In Akar\'s absence, Ümit Dündar, head of the First Army, was appointed Acting Chief of Staff.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning of 16 July, soldiers blocking the Bosphorus Bridge surrendered to the police.According to the government-run Anadolu Agency, this consisted of a group of 50 soldiers.Some of these soldiers were lynched by civilians despite the police\'s efforts, who fired into the air to protect the surrendering soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile, in the headquarters of the Turkish Army, 700 unarmed soldiers surrendered as the police conducted an operation into the building while 150 armed soldiers were kept inside by the police.The coupists in the TRT building in Istanbul surrendered in the early morning as well.Chief of Staff Akar, held hostage at the Akıncı Air Base in Ankara, was also rescued by pro-state forces.\n\nOne of the primary reasons that the coup failed was chaos among the plotters\' ranks.Turkey\'s National Intelligence Organization (MİT) head Hakan Fidan discovered the coup plot, and the plotters were forced to execute the coup five hours ahead of schedule.One of the main organizers, General Semih Terzi, was shot dead by loyalist Sgt.Maj.Ömer Halisdemir at the onset, demoralizing and disrupting command and control of the rebels.These two incidents resulted in the coup being carried out in an uncoordinated manner.The highest ranking staff officers opposed the coup, and publicly ordered all personnel to return to their barracks.Acting outside the military chain of command, the rebels lacked the coordination and resources to achieve their goals.The conscripted soldiers that the rebels mobilized were uninformed of their mission\'s true purpose and became demoralized.Many surrendered rather than shoot demonstrators.The commander of the First Army in Istanbul, General Ümit Dündar, personally called Erdoğan to warn him of the plot, persuading him to evacuate his hotel ahead of the plotters, and helped to secure Istanbul for Erdoğan to land.The MİT also mobilized its anti-aircraft guns, which the plotters were unaware existed, deterring rebel jets and commando teams.\n\nEqually important to the coup\'s failure, according to military strategist Edward N. Luttwak, was the inability of the rebels to neutralize Erdoğan and other high ranking government officials, either by killing or detaining them.A unit of special forces was sent via helicopter to kill or capture the president, but missed because he had been evacuated by his security detail just minutes before.Once Erdoğan landed at Atatürk International Airport (which had been recaptured from the rebels by his supporters), It became highly unlikely that the coup attempt would succeed.According to a military source, several rebel F-16s targeted Erdoğan\'s presidential jet en route to Istanbul, but they did not fire.A senior Turkish counter-terrorism official later stated that the jets did not fire because the fighter jet pilots were told by President Erdoğan\'s pilot over the radio that the (flight of the) Gulfstream IV was a Turkish Airlines flight.\n\nAccording to Naunihal Singh, author of Seizing Power, the coup attempt also failed because the plotters failed to secure control of the media and shape the narrative.Successful coups require that the rebels control the mass media.This allows even small rebel contingents to portray themselves as fully in control, and their victory as inevitable.Consequently, they convince the public, along with neutral and even loyalist soldiers, to defect to them or not resist.The rebels failed to properly broadcast their messages effectively across the media that they controlled.They failed to capture Türksat, Turkey\'s main cable and satellite communications company, and failed to gain control of the country\'s television and mobile phone networks.This allowed Erdoğan to make his Facetime call, and to speak on television.\n\nOther scholars of civil-military relations, like Drew H. Kinney, have said reports like Luttwak and Singh\'s miss the point of their own analysis: civil resistance thwarted the coup.Luttwak argues that wayward elements of the Turkish armed forces could not silence Erdoğan.Singh says that the rebels could not project success because they couldn\'t control the message.Kinney states that neither of these reasons on their own matter, but rather it\'s their effect—civil disobedience—that is important.We might find that ""[Gülen\'s movement] ...[might] have had nothing to do with the attempted takeover in July, but civilians [nevertheless] definitely played a role in thwarting the coup,"" writes Kinney.""...[A]n unhappy civilian populace mobilized to face down the military.""\n\nErdoğan wasn\'t censored (Luttwak\'s point) and was therefore able to use FaceTime to mobilize resistance, which in turn hindered the conspirators\' ability to project success (Singh\'s point).The result is civilian resistance to soldiers, i.e., people power.The reason Singh, Luttwak, and other scholars of civil-military relations miss this is, according to Kinney, because they ""usually do not study extra-military reasons for coup failures/successes,"" but rather put a premium on ""the inner-workings of the [military] operation.""In short, they blame the military for its failure rather than acknowledge the power of the masses and their successes.\n\nPro-state forces sent text messages to every Turkish citizen calling for them to protest against the coup attempt.Throughout the night sela prayers were repeatedly called from mosque minarets across the country to encourage people to resist the coup plotters.While the sela is usually called from minarets to inform the public of a funeral, they are also traditionally performed to notify of a significant event, in this case ""to rally people"".\n\nThe coup plotters initiated their operation hours ahead of the planned time when they understood that their plans had been compromised.Had the coup been launched at its original time, the middle of the night, much of the population would have been asleep.The streets would have been mostly empty.\n\nReports have emerged, neither confirmed nor denied by Russia or Turkey that the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate intercepted signals on an imminent coup passed on to loyal Turkish operatives.The intercepted plans revealed several helicopters with commandos were on the way to Marmaris\'s coastal resort, where Erdoğan stayed, capturing or killing him.Pre-warned, Erdoğan left quickly to avoid them.\n\nAn extensive purge of the Turkish civil service began in the wake of the coup attempt, with President Erdoğan warning his opponents that ""they will pay a heavy price for this.""The New York Times along with some other Western media such as The Economist, described the purges as a ""counter-coup"", with the Times expecting the president to ""become more vengeful and obsessed with control than ever, exploiting the crisis not just to punish mutinous soldiers but to further quash whatever dissent is left in Turkey,"".As of 20 July 2016, the purge already had seen over 45,000 military officials, police officers, judges, governors and civil servants arrested or suspended, including 2,700 judges, 15,000 teachers, and every university dean in the country.\n\n163 generals and admirals were detained, around 45% of the Turkish military\'s total.\n\nOn 18 July 2016, United States State Secretary John Kerry urged Turkish authorities to halt the increasing crackdown on its citizens, indicating that the crackdown was meant to ""suppress dissent.""French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault voiced concern, warning against a ""political system which turns away from democracy"" in response to the purges.\n\nOn 17 August 2016, Turkey started releasing what was expected to eventually amount to about 38,000 prison inmates, to make more space in the penal system for detainees, numbering about 35,000, who were arrested or detained after being involved in or suspected of association, with the 2016 failed coup.\n\nOn 28 September 2016, Turkish justice minister Bekir Bozdağ said 70,000 people had been processed and 32,000 were formally arrested.\n\nMajor General Cahit Bakir, who commanded Turkish forces under NATO in Afghanistan, and Brigadier General Sener Topuc, responsible for education and aid in Afghanistan, were detained by authorities in Dubai connected with the failed coup.\n\nGeneral Akın Öztürk, former Commander of the Turkish Air Force, was the Turkish military attaché to Israel.He was arrested on charges of having played a leading role in the failed coup.Öztürk has denied the charges.\n\nGeneral Adem Huduti, the commander of the Second Army, positioned along the southern borders with Syria and Iraq, and General Erdal Öztürk, the commander of the 3rd Corps, were also arrested.\n\nRear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been stationed at NATO\'s Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk, Virginia, sought asylum in the United States after being recalled by the Turkish government.\n\nIn July 2018, Istanbul\'s 25th Criminal Court sentenced 72 former soldiers involved in the coup attempt to life in prison.\n\nOn 20 June 2019, a terrorism court in Turkey sentenced 151 people to life in prison, including General Akın Öztürk, former commander of Turkish Air Force and the most senior officer involved in the coup.128 people received ""aggravated life"" sentences, which indicates harsh conditions without parole, for their role in the coup, with another 23 receiving standard life sentences.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom President Erdoğan said as one of the principal conspirators, condemned the coup attempt and denied any role in it.""I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey,"" he said in an emailed statement reported by The New York Times.""Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force.I pray to God for Turkey, Turkish citizens, and all those currently in Turkey that this situation is resolved peacefully and quickly.As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nPresident Erdoğan asked the United States to extradite Gülen: ""I call on you again, after there was a coup attempt.Extradite this man in Pennsylvania to Turkey!If we are strategic partners or model partners, do what is necessary.""Prime Minister Yildirim has threatened war against any country that would support Gülen.Turkish Labor Minister Süleyman Soylu said that ""America is behind the coup.""\n\nRegarding the AKP\'s statement against Gülen, Secretary of State Kerry invited the Turkish government ""to present us with any legitimate evidence that withstands scrutiny,"" before they would accept an extradition request.\n\nOn 15 August 2016, former United States diplomat James Jeffrey, who was the United States ambassador to Turkey from 2008 until 2010 made the following remarks: ""The Gülen movement has some infiltration at the least in the military that I am aware of.They of course had extreme infiltration into the police and judiciary earlier.I saw that when I was in Turkey previously, particularly in the Sledgehammer case, Hakan Fidan case, and the corruption cases in 2013.Obviously, significant segment of Turkey\'s bureaucracy was infiltrated and had their allegiance to a movement.That of course is absolutely unacceptable and extremely dangerous.It likely led to the coup attempt.""\n\nOutside Turkey, in Beringen, Belgium, anti-coup protesters attempted to attack a building owned by the pro-Gülen movement group \'Vuslat\'.The police brought in a water cannon to keep the attackers at bay.In news articles it was stated that the police also protected the houses of Gülen supporters.People advocated on social media to go to Beringen once more, and there was unrest in Heusden-Zolder, elsewhere in Belgium.Furthermore, in Somalia the government ordered ""the total closure of all activities"" of an organization linked to the Gülen movement, and gave its staff seven days to leave the country.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, President Erdoğan said Western countries were ""supporting terrorism"" and the military coup, saying ""I\'m calling on the United States: what kind of strategic partners are we, that you can still host someone whose extradition I have asked for?""\n\nOn 31 January 2017, British Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, Alan Duncan said he believed the Gülen movement was responsible for the coup attempt.Duncan went on saying ""the organization which incorporated itself into the state tried to topple the democratic structure in Turkey"".\n\nIn a speech on 29 July 2016, President Erdoğan said U.S. Central Command chief Joseph Votel was ""siding with coup plotters""; Erdoğan said the United States was protecting Fethullah Gülen, whom the Turkish government blames for the coup attempt.Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim made similar comments.In response, Votel said that the Turkish government\'s statements were ""unfortunate and completely inaccurate"" and expressed concern that the mass arrests and firings of military officers would damage military cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey.Similarly, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said that the Turkish military purges were impairing the fight against ISIS.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, in an escalation of tensions with the United States, Erdoğan questioned Turkey\'s relationship with the United States and criticized the West, saying that ""script"" for the abortive putsch last month was ""written abroad"".Erdoğan stated that he had personally asked Obama to extradite Gülen to Turkey.When the U.S. government replied it would need evidence of the cleric\'s guilt before extradition, to which Erdoğan said: ""When you asked for the return of a terrorist, we did not ask for documentation. ...Let us put him on trial.""\n\nYeni Şafak daily, a Turkish pro-state newspaper, stated that the former commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, now-retired United States Army General John F. Campbell, was the ""mastermind"" behind the coup attempt in Turkey.Campbell called the statement ""absolutely ridiculous"" and President Obama said ""Any reports that we had any previous knowledge of a coup attempt, that there was any U.S. involvement in it, that we were anything other than entirely supportive of Turkish democracy are completely false, unequivocally false.""\n\nOn 1 December 2017, Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for American political analyst, former CIA official and former vice chairman of US National Intelligence Council Graham Fuller, stating his involvement in the coup.A career US State Department official who was once CIA Station Chief in Kabul and later went on to be a political scientist in Rand Corporation specializing in the Middle East, Turkish authorities said Fuller attended a meeting in Istanbul on 15 July 2016 involving organization and coordination of the botched coup.Another American among the attendance, as stated by the Turkish prosecutors, was academic Henri Barkey who was named a suspect a week after the failed coup.\n\nThe U.S. consulate in Turkey issued an advisory to U.S. citizens to avoid the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey, which houses about 50 nuclear bombs, until ""normal operations have been restored"".They stated that local authorities were denying access to the air base and that power supplying the air base was shut off.\n\nThe Incirlik base is important to the U.S.-led effort in Syria to combat ISIL and other militants.Nearly 1,500 American personnel are housed in the base.\n\nTwenty-four hours after initial reports that the air base was shut down, United States defense department officials confirmed that the base and its airspace had re-opened to military aircraft and that operations by American aircraft will resume.The Turkish commander of the air base, brig.Gen. Bekir Ercan Van was arrested.After the failure of the coup Gen Bekir Ercan Van sought asylum from the U.S., but his request was denied by U.S.\n\nFollowing the failed coup attempt multiple media outlets have published editorials advocating the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Incirlik Air base as Turkey is unstable.\n\nOn 16 July, anti-coup protesters chanted against locals in areas of Istanbul with high concentration of Alevis, including Okmeydanı and Gazi.Such incidents also occurred in a quarter of Antakya with a high Alevi population, where a motorcyclist stating to be a sharia advocate was lynched.In a neighbourhood of Ankara, shops belonging to Syrians were attacked by a mob.In Malatya, Sunni Islamists harassed residents of an Alevi neighbourhood, particularly the women, and attempted to enter the neighbourhood en masse.Police intervened and blocked all roads leading there.In Kadıköy, people drinking alcohol in public were attacked by a group of religious fundamentalists.\n\nFollowing the arrests, thousands of anti-coup protesters demanded instituting the death penalty against detainees connected with the coup, chanting ""we want the death penalty"".President Erdoğan has been open to reinstituting the death penalty, noting that ""in a democracy, whatever the people want they will get.""Turkish authorities have not executed anyone since 1984, but legally abolished capital punishment only in 2004 as a pre-condition to join the European Union.\n\nEuropean Union officials have been vocal about their opposition to purges by Turkish authorities in connection to the coup.French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that Turkey must work within the framework of the law to uphold Europe\'s democratic principles.Furthermore, on 18 July 2016, Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of Foreign Affairs of the European Union, announced that no country will be admitted into the European Union ""if it introduces the death penalty"".Moreover, German press secretary, Steffen Seibert, stated that reinstituting the death penalty will end Turkey\'s accession talks with the European Union.\n\nTurkey is a member of the Council of Europe, and ratified the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) as part of its terms of membership.The ECHR is an international treaty that includes the abolition of the death penalty among its terms.As such, Turkey is legally bound not to reintroduce the death penalty.\n\nOn 20 July 2016, President Erdoğan announced a three-month state of emergency in response to the attempted coup, invoking Article 120 of the Constitution of Turkey (""Declaration of state of emergency because of widespread acts of violence and serious deterioration of public order"").Under the state of emergency, under Article 121, ""the Council of Ministers, meeting under the chairpersonship of the President of the Republic, may issue decrees having the force of law on matters necessitated by the state of emergency"", with decrees subject to subsequent parliamentary approval.The state of emergency was endorsed by the Parliament on 21 July by 346 votes to 115.The Justice and Development Party and the Nationalist Movement Party supported the state of emergency, whilst the Republican People\'s Party and the Peoples\' Democratic Party opposed it.Prime Minister Yıldırım said at the Parliament that the state of emergency was necessary to ""get rid of this scourge rapidly"".\n\nAs part of the state of emergency, deputy prime minister Kurtulmuş announced that Turkey was temporarily suspending part of the European Convention on Human Rights following the attempted coup, invoking Article 15 of the Convention (""war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation"").The suspensions must be notified to the Council of Europe and may not affect the right to a fair trial or the prohibition on torture.\n\nThis state of emergency in Turkey as well as the hindrance of the right to protest that occurred within such framework have been layered onto a longer history of emergency rules, oppressive legislation and daily government practice that have reinforced both.We can see from this the ""autocratisation"" process in Turkey has thrived of existing legal framework deeply associated in legacies of past ""emergencies"".\n\nOn 3 October 2016 Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş declared the governments intention to extend the state of emergency by a further three months raising objections from both the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) and Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) were critical of the governments use of their emergency powers and declared that they would vote against an extension.\n\nFollowing the National Security Council\'s recommendation for the extension President Erdoğan stated that it was possible that the state of emergency could last for longer than a year prompting outcry from the opposition, Leader of the Main Opposition Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu said that ""The president saying that the state of emergency can last longer than 12 months is strengthening the fear of a counter-coup"" and that it was ""raising the prospect of opportunist measures.""\n\nThe AKP\'s governmental majority allowed the three-month extension to take effect on 19 October 2016.The two-year-long state of emergency was ended on 19 July 2018.\n\nOn 16 July 2016, the media reported that eight Turkish military personnel of various ranks had landed in Greece\'s northeastern city of Alexandroupolis on board a Black Hawk helicopter and claimed political asylum in Greece.While the Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu demanded extradition of ""the eight traitors as soon as possible"", the Greek authorities stated: ""We will follow the procedures of international law.However, we give severe considerations to the fact that [the Turkish military men] are accused, in their own country, of violating the constitutional order and trying to overthrow democracy.""The helicopter was returned to Turkey shortly thereafter.The eight asylum seekers, their asylum case pending, were later transferred to Athens, mainly for safety reasons.On 26 January, the Supreme Court of Greece eventually ruled against their extradition, on the grounds that the eight were unlikely to face a fair trial if returned to their home country and due to concerns over their safety.\n\nOn 15 February 2017, five Turkish commandos illegally entered Greece through the Evros river.However, once they entered the country, the group split.The two of them surrendered to the police and on 20 February 2017, requested political asylum.They were being held in the city of Alexandroupolis.The two men belonged to the Turkish navy.The names given by the two reportedly match the names of two fugitives wanted in relation to the shadowy operation against Erdoğan himself.The Greek government mentioned that the Greek authorities will not allow the country to be dragged into the ongoing feud between the Turkish state and the followers of Gulen.But there were no sign of the other three.According to a lawyer there were indications that the other three have been arrested by Greek authorities who were about to expel them to Turkey.According to new evidence and new information these three ""arrested"" marines were delivered under fast and informal procedures from Greek to Turkish services.\n\nAfter the coup attempt, two Turkish military attachés in Athens, Staff Col. İlhan Yaşıtlı and naval attaché Col. Halis Tunç, had reportedly disappeared along with their families.The Greek foreign ministry canceled the two attachés\' accreditations on 7 August 2016, upon the request of the Turkish foreign ministry.Greek media reported that they might have fled to Italy.On 11 August 2016, the Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu confirmed the reports saying that they had left Greece for Italy on 6 August and adding that Turkey would officially ask the Italian authorities to extradite the two soldiers.\n\nOn 9 August 2016, the media reported that Turkey\'s Rear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been on a United States-based assignment for NATO and after the coup was subject to a detention order in Turkey, had sought asylum in the United States.\n\nIn mid-November 2016, it was officially confirmed that about 40 Turkish military servicemen of various ranks stationed at NATO command structures had applied for asylum in Germany and Belgium.\n\nIn January 2017, Der Spiegel magazine and ARD broadcaster reported that about 40 mostly high-ranking Turkish soldiers who worked at NATO facilities in Germany requested asylum in Germany.\n\nAt the end of February 2017, Germany said it had received 136 asylum requests from Turks holding diplomatic passports since the July coup attempt.The figure was a total for August 2016 to January 2017; some were presumed to be military officers posted to NATO bases in Germany.\n\nIn November 2016, NATO\'s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that Turkish NATO Officers had requested asylum in the countries where they had been posted.He did not name the nations involved or the number of officers, saying it was a matter for those countries to decide.He said: ""Some Turkish officers working in NATO command structure ... have requested asylum in the countries where they are working. ...As always, this is an issue that is going to be assessed and decided by the different NATO allies as a national issue.""\n\nAs of March 2017, Norway have granted asylum for four Turkish soldiers and a military attache.\n\nSeveral Turkish citizens with diplomatic passports have sought political asylum in Switzerland.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, detainees in Turkey have been denied access to legal counsel, have been beaten and tortured.They have not been provided with adequate food, water, or medical care.At least one has attempted suicide.Amnesty International wanted the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture to send people to check on detainees conditions.A person who had been on duty at the Ankara police headquarters said that police denied medical treatment to a detainee.""Let him die.We will say he came to us dead,"" the witness quoted a police doctor as saying.\n\nAlso, Erdoğan has extended the maximum period of detention for suspects from four days to 30, a move Amnesty said increased the risk of torture or other maltreatment of detainees.\n\nTurkish Justice Ministry denied the reports and the Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said on his Twitter account: ""There has not been any torture or assault of detainees in custody,"" in response to reports by Amnesty International.""The claims of torture and assault make up a pre-packaged misinformation campaign formed by members of FETÖ, one which is untrue and distorted,""\n\nOn 7 August, between three and five million people gathered for an anti-coup rally organized by the Turkish authorities in Istanbul.President Erdoğan and the two leaders of the major opposition parties (the Republican People\'s Party and the Nationalist Movement Party) were present.\n\nGreek authorities on several Aegean islands have called for emergency measures to curtail a growing flow of refugees from Turkey; the number of migrants and refugees willing to make the journey across the Aegean has increased noticeably after the failed coup.At Athens officials voiced worries because Turkish monitors overseeing the deal in Greece had been abruptly pulled out after the failed coup without being replaced.Also, the mayor of Kos expressed concern in a letter to the Greek Prime Minister citing the growing influx of refugees and migrants after the failed coup.The Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises (SETE) warned about the prospect of another flare-up in the refugee/migrant crisis due to the Turkish political instability.\n\nVincent Cochetel, the director of the Europe Bureau of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in August 2016 that parts of the EU-Turkey deal about immigration were already de facto suspended because no Turkish police were present at Greek detention centres to oversee deportations.\n\nOn 25 August 2016, seven Turkish citizens sought asylum in Greece.Two were university professors, and their two children applied for asylum in Alexandroupoli after they illegally entered the country from the northeastern border.Also, three businessmen illegally reached the Greek island of Rhodes, and they also applied for asylum.\n\nOn 30 August 2016, a Turkish judge arrived at the Greek island of Chios on a migrant boat, with six Syrian nationals, and sought asylum in the country.He told the Greek coastguard and police officers that he is being persecuted in Turkey for his political beliefs by President Tayyip Erdoğan.The Turkish judge had been arrested for illegally entering the country and was transferred to Athens for his asylum proceedings.The Syrian nationals claimed refugee status.\n\nOn 11 September 2016, four Turkish civilians were arrested by Turkish police.An academic and a teacher attempted to escape to Greece illegally by crossing the Evros river, and the other two because they organized the escape attempt.The academic and the teacher paid a total of 12,500 euros in Istanbul to arrange their escape to Greece.Before their attempt, both the academic and the teacher were suspended from their duties as part of the ongoing probe into the failed coup attempt.Police also seized an air raft, an oar and a pump while detaining the suspects.The court later ordered the two\'s release while the other two suspects, who organized the escape attempt, were arrested.\n\nOn 21 September 2016, ten Turkish civilians, two men, two women and six children landed by boat illegally on the Greek island of Rhodes and sought asylum.They told the Greek authorities they were working in the private sector in Turkey and the Turkish government was persecuting them due to their political beliefs.\n\nOn 29 September 2016, five Turkish nationals, a couple and their child and two other men, arrived in Greece, at Alexandroupolis by crossing the Evros River by boat illegally and requested political asylum.\n\nOn 12 December 2016, one female Turkish national, landed by boat, full of refugees and immigrants, illegally on the Greek island of Lesbos.She requested political asylum.\n\nOn 24 October 2017, Turkish authorities obtained information that 995 Turks have applied for asylum in Greece after the coup attempt.\n\nMore than 1,800 Turkish citizens requested asylum in Greece in 2017.\n\nOn 18 February 2018, seventeen Turkish nationals, including six children, requested asylum in Greece at Oinousses island.\n\nIn August 2018, the former lawmaker for the Peoples\' Democratic Party, Leyla Birlik, requested asylum in Greece after illegally crossing the border near Alexandroupolis.\n\nBerlin mayor, Michael Müller (SPD), said Turkey was waging war on supporters of the Gülen movement in Germany.He said that Turkish officials had approached him and asked him whether he would be prepared to confront the Gülen movement in Berlin critically and, if necessary, to support measures against it.The mayor rejected the idea and made it very clear that Turkish conflicts could not be waged in the city.\n\nDer Spiegel presented classified documents, which showed that Turkey\'s secret service (MIT) had asked Germany\'s foreign intelligence agency (BND) for help in rounding up Gülen supporters in Germany.The Turkish secret service wanted the BND to use its influence to spur German lawmakers into taking action against Gülen supporters and extraditing them to Turkey.Also, Turkey\'s government has sent German authorities requests for searches and extraditions linked to supporters of Fethullah Gülen in Germany.\n\nIn Germany businesses thought to be in support of the Gülen movement have been harassed by Erdoğan supporters.\n\nAfter the failed coup, there was a massive demonstration in Cologne at Germany, in late July, in support of Turkish President Erdoğan.Erdoğan wanted to address the participants via video but was rejected by the local authorities and the German Constitutional Court due to security concerns.Turkey said that the ban was unacceptable and a violation of freedom of expression.\n\nGerman authorities said Turkish mosques in Germany were playing Turkish politics and worried that Turkey\'s internal politics spilled over into German cities.For years, German authorities had encouraged Turkey\'s state-run religious institution Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs usually referred to as DİTİB to provide Islamic preachers and teachers and Gülen Movement Schools for the large Turkish diaspora in Germany.DİTİB manages some 900 mosques in Germany.Gülen movement runs 100 educational facilities in Germany.\n\nAfter the failed coup DİTİB published a sermon praising ""our noble nation"" for rising against ""a wretched network"" that had sown ""seeds of sedition, rebellion and hostility.""According to Volker Beck, a member of the center-left Greens in Germany\'s Bundestag, ""That was not a religious text.It was a declaration of obedience to Mr. Erdoğan and his measures since the coup attempt,"" Volker Kauder, parliamentary group leader of the Germany\'s ruling Christian Democrats, the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU)/Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) faction, said Turkish-Germans should be loyal to Germany first and foremost.\n\nGermans of Turkish origin are being pressured in Germany by informers and officers of Turkey\'s MIT spy agency.According to reports Turkey had 6,000 informants plus MIT officers in Germany who were putting pressure on ""German Turks"".Hans-Christian Ströbele said that there was an ""unbelievable"" level of ""secret activities"" in Germany by Turkey\'s MIT agency.According to Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, not even the former communist East German Stasi secret police had managed to run such a large ""army of agents"" in the former West Germany: ""Here, it\'s not just about intelligence gathering, but increasingly about intelligence service repression.""\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nGermany\'s Office for Migration and Refugees said on 18 November 2016, it had received 4,437 political asylum requests from Turkish citizens up to October, compared to 1,767 for the whole of last year.""We must expect that the number of Turks who are seeking political asylum in Germany will continue to rise,"" said Stephan Mayer, the domestic policy speaker of the union coalition in the Bundestag.\n\nOn 10 December 2016, eleven Turkish nationals, 10 adults and one child, in a martial arts group have applied for asylum in Germany.\n\nAs of January 2018, Germany was first place and Greece second as EU destinations of choice for Turkish nationals requesting asylum after the coup attempt.\n\nTurkish police have carried out simultaneous raids in 18 cities against companies associated with United States-based Fethullah Gülen.The state-run Anadolu Agency said police searched 204 premises and detained 187 businessmen for ""membership in a terror organization"" and ""providing financial support to a terror organization"".All suspects\' assets were seized.\n\nWikiLeaks released Turkish emails and documents to respond to the Turkish government\'s purges that followed the coup attempt.In turn, the Turkish Telecommunications Communications Board blocked access to the WikiLeaks website.On 17 July 2016 Wikileaks had announced on Twitter, the leak of approximately 300,000 emails and over 500,000 documents, including those to and from AKP.\n\nWikiLeaks stated that it was attacked shortly after 17 July announcement of the planned publication and hypothesized that Turkish authorities were responsible.WikiLeaks stated in a tweet, ""our infrastructure is under sustained attack.""Tweets from WikiLeaks include ""We are unsure of the true origin of the attack.The timing suggests a Turkish state power faction or its allies.We will prevail & publish.""and: ""Turks will likely be censored to prevent them reading our pending release of 100k+ docs on politics leading up to the coup."", ""We ask that Turks are ready with censorship bypassing systems such as TorBrowser and uTorrent""; ""And that everyone else is ready to help them bypass censorship and push our links through the censorship to come.""\n\nUpon the release of the email dump, it has been reported that the emails contain little to no damning information, and instead are just mails from a public mailing list, but also linked externally to ""voter information on all of the women registered to vote in 78 out of Turkey\'s 81 provinces"".\n\nSeveral places were renamed to commemorate the failed coup: Boğaziçi Köprüsü (Bosphorus Bridge) → 15 Temmuz Şehitler Köprüsü Kızılay Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Kızılay Demokrasi Meydanı Ahmet Taner Kışlalı Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Milli İrade Meydanı (Reverted to original name a few days later) Büyük İstanbul Otogarı → İstanbul 15 Temmuz Demokrasi Otogarı In TRT, Yeni Haber Stüdyosu → 15 Temmuz Millet Stüdyosu Kazan → Kahramankazan about the province\'s local people\'s resistance to the coup plotters.Kahraman means ""hero"" in Turkish Niğde University → Niğde Ömer Halisdemir University\n\nIn 2018, the Istanbul Municipal Council decided to change the names of a total of 90 streets that included words which could be associated with FETÖ.\n\nThe Presidency of Religious Affairs stated that it would not be providing religious funeral services to the dead coupists, except for ""privates and low-ranking officers compelled by force and threats who found themselves in the midst of the conflict without full knowledge of anything"".\n\nA document dated 26 September 2016 showed that Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) asked Turkish missions and religious representatives abroad to profile Gülen movement expatriates living in their respective foreign countries.Gülen-linked schools, businesses, foundations, associations, media outlets and others were also included in the reports.Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs has gathered intelligence via imams from 38 countries.\n\nBelgium officials said they would withdraw recognition of Diyanet mosques in the country if necessary.\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nOn 21 December 2016, the Turkish government has recalled Yusuf Acar, the religious affairs attaché of the Turkish Embassy in the Netherlands, after Dutch authorities said he was spying.Acar collected information of people who sympathize with Fethullah Gülen at Netherlands and passed it on to the Turkish authorities.The Dutch government called spying activities an ""unwanted and non-acceptable interference in the lives of Dutch citizens.""and the attaché was reportedly declared persona non grata and received a ""deportation warning"" by Dutch authorities.\n\nOn 26 January 2017, President Erdoğan, during his visit to Tanzania, asked his Tanzanian counterpart John Magufuli to take action against the network of Fethullah Gülen.\n\nIn April 2017 it was announced that President Erdoğan planned to establish a purpose-built museum dedicated to the coup events, called the ""Museum of the 15 July: Martyrs and Democracy"", to be located in Kahramankazan, a town near Ankara.Paid for by Turkish Ministry of Culture funds, it is planned to open at the end of 2018.The museum opened in December 2019\n\nAmong the Turkish opposition parties, the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) issued a statement expressing their public opposition to the coup, and the Hürriyet Daily News reported that Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bahçeli telephoned Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım to express his opposition to the coup.The co-chairs of the opposition Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) issued a statement saying that the party was ""under all circumstances and as a matter of principle against all kinds of coup.""Amongst the minor parties, left-wing nationalist Patriotic Party\'s Doğu Perinçek backed democracy, when he held Gülen and the Americans responsible.Kurdish militant separatist organization Kurdistan Workers\' Party, which Turkey and its allies label as a terrorist organization, urged their supporters to stay away from the coup and rather defend their people, while the Communist Party called upon the people to overthrow the AKP government which they called an ""enemy of humanity"".\n\nDuring the first hours of the coup plotters\' moves of blocking Istanbul\'s bridges and flying fighter jets low over Istanbul and Ankara, Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjørn Jagland tweeted against the coup attempt and underlined that ""any attempt to overthrow the democratically elected leaders is unacceptable"".\n\nRussia\'s President Vladimir Putin called Erdoğan out of solidarity before all NATO member countries\' heads following the coup attempt.Erdoğan thanked the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev – who was the first president to show solidarity after the coup attempt – for his support in solving the 7-month crisis over downed Russian Sukhoi Su-24 and the Prime Minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, who was among the first NATO country leaders to condemn the coup attempt, already from the early hours of Saturday.\n\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the then prime minister of Pakistan, was all praise for the people of Turkey and the AKP government and strongly condemned what he termed as an attempt to undermine democracy in Turkey.""We deeply admire the resolve of the brave and resilient Turkish people, who stood up against the forces of darkness and anarchy to express their support and commitment to democracy,"" the PM said in a statement issued from his office.\n\nThe majority of countries either expressed their support for the government or called for restraint.On 16 July 2016, however, a proposed United Nations Security Council statement denouncing the coup was not accepted by Egypt, a non-permanent member of the Council at the time, due to textual disagreements.Egyptian diplomats said that the council is ""in no position to qualify, or label [the Turkish] government – or any other government for that matter – as democratically elected or not"".Objection by the United States and the UK – permanent members of the Security Council – led to Egypt proposing a new statement calling for all sides to ""respect the democratic and constitutional principles and the rule of law"", which was rejected, preventing the condemnation of the coup attempt by the Security Council.The leader of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky supported the coup attempt.\n\nAl-Monitor reported that ""Unlike Ankara\'s Western allies, Iran did not wait for the coup\'s failure to speak up.Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif voiced support for democracy in a Twitter message in the early hours of the unrest, writing ""Stability, and democracy in Turkey are paramount"".In a subsequent phone call after the failure of the coup attempt, President Hassan Rouhani told Erdoğan the coup attempt was ""a test to identify your domestic and foreign friends and enemies.""An Iranian official pointed out parallels between the coup attempt in Turkey and the coup against Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mussadiq in 1953: ""What we know is that this attempt was triggered by foreign hands.We have experienced the same thing in the past.Since Mr. Erdogan wants to play a more positive path in the region today, they want to overthrow him.""\n\nMustafa Akıncı, President of Northern Cyprus, welcomed the fact that ""no community in Turkey ... applauded the coup as they have done in the past.""Azerbaijan strongly condemned the attempted military coup in Turkey and considered such actions unacceptable according to a statement from Novruz Mammadov, deputy head of the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration and chief of the foreign relations department.\n\nEuropean Commissioner dealing with Turkey\'s EU membership bid, Johannes Hahn, said it appears Turkey\'s government prepared arrest lists of political opponents before the coup attempt and had been waiting for the right time to act.In this sense, EU reported that as a main criticism to put this issue in the category of terrorism become the violation of the fundamental rights and fundamental values of the citizens.Hence, it underlines a total divergence of opinions and mentality between EU and Turkey which reached a deadlock here especially after the 15th of July in 2016.\n\nOn 19 July 2016, White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said during a press briefing that President Barack Obama has held a phone conversation with President Erdoğan: ""The President used the phone call to reiterate once again the strong commitment of the United States to the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey.The President pledged any needed assistance to the Turkish government as they conduct an investigation to determine exactly what happened.""\n\nOn 20 July 2016, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""Turkey has a large armed force, professional armed forces and ...I am certain they will continue as a committed and strong NATO ally.""On a statement released on 10 August 2016, the Secretary General once more strongly condemned the attempted coup and reiterated full support for Turkey\'s democratic institutions.He also expressed support for the elected Turkish government and respect for the courage of the Turkish people for resisting the coup plotters.\n\nOn 29 July 2016, the commander of U.S. Central Command, General Joseph Votel, denied statements by Turkey\'s president Erdoğan that he has supported the coup attempt in Turkey.\n\nOn 1 August 2016, United States Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, General Joseph Dunford, visited Turkey and condemned the coup attempt.Dunford said: ""The consistent theme throughout the day was a reaffirmation of the importance of the U.S.-Turkey relationship – the need for us to cooperate.""\n\nOn July, 20, there were reports that a group of Turkish military commandos coup fugitives would try to cross from Turkey to the island of Symi, in the southeastern Aegean, at Greece.The Hellenic Coast Guard was on alert and increased the patrols in the area, especially after a group of inflatable dinghies and other vessels were seen departing from Datça, on the Turkish coast, in the direction of Symi, they monitored the movements of the Turkish vessels, which remained in Turkish waters.Furthermore, a contingent of the Hellenic Police was dispatched to Symi to conduct checks there.The Greek government had been anticipating a possible attempt by participants in the failed coup to come to Greece and took the reports seriously.Turkish F-16 fighter jets were also scrambled to check reports that missing Turkish coast guard vessels had appeared in Greek waters in the Aegean.Later on the day, the Turkish interior ministry denied reports that rebel soldiers might have ""hijacked"" a vessel to flee to Greece.The Greek armed forces remained on alert the throughout the day for potential coup fugitives.\n\nAccording to Michael Rubin, from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Erdoğan had himself to blame for the coup.Following an increasingly Islamist agenda, Erdoğan had reportedly ""dropped any pretense of governing for all Turks.""After ""fanning the flames"" at the 2013 Gezi Park protests, he transformed the predominantly Kurdish-inhabited areas of southeastern Turkey ""into a war zone reminiscent of the worst days of the 1980s.""The biggest problem, according to Rubin, might have been Erdoğan\'s foreign policy, which managed to turn the initial ""no problems with neighbors"" doctrine into a situation where the country has problems with almost every neighbor and has even alienated some of its allies and friends.Rubin previously worked as an official at the Pentagon and less than 4 months before the coup, he wrote an article in Newsweek magazine titled, ""Will There Be a Coup Against Erdogan in Turkey?""\n\nBritish Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk warned that ""too late did Erdoğan realize the cost of the role he had chosen for his country.It\'s one thing to say sorry to Putin and patch up relations with Netanyahu; but when you can no longer trust your army, there are more serious matters to concentrate upon.""Even if this coup may have failed, Fisk expected another to follow in the months or years to come.\n\nTurkish professor Akın Ünver described the coup d\'état attempt as ""more of a mutiny"".\n\nThe name of the ""Peace at Home Council"" – Yurtta Sulh Konseyi – is derived from Atatürk\'s famous saying \'Peace at Home, Peace in the World\'.Journalist Ezgi Başaran said that ""the statement of the junta, that was [...] read on the [...] government TV [channel] as the coup got under way, bore a strong resemblance to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk\'s famous address to the Turkish Youth.[...] On the other hand, given that these references are too obvious, they may have been intentionally included to insinuate a Kemalist junta rather than a Gülenist one.""\n\nThe citizen journalism site Bellingcat published an analysis of the messages of a WhatsApp group consisting of high-ranking military officials who had taken part in the coup covering their activities including them killing several people.The messages were cross referenced with video footage.The group was named ""Yurtta sulh"" which refers to a peace at home speech and they seem secular and military with no references to Gülen or anything related during the several hours of messaging.\n\nNews reports have suggested that the coup ringleader was Adil Öksüz.Some believe Öksüz to have been an operative with Turkish intelligence.\n\nGerman Islamic studies scholar said the putschists tried to forestall a large-scale purge of judiciary and military, the implementation of which had already started on Saturday, the day after the coup attempt.According to Turkish investigative journalist Ahmet Şık, a list of officials to be purged had been ready compiled by the attorney-general of Izmir, Okan Bato, and was approved by President Erdoğan.According to this version, the putschists had to quickly bring forward their coup attempt before being disposed and arrested.\n\nDuring and after the events, several politicians and commentators suggested that the government knew about the coup in advance and possibly directed it.The facts that the coup attempt began in the evening rather than at a more inconspicuous time and that the events were largely confined to Ankara and Istanbul contributed to doubts about the authenticity of the coup attempt.Journalists and opposition politicians branded it a \'tragic comedy\' and \'theatre play\'.Advocates of such theories pointed to how Erdoğan stood to gain from the coup attempt in terms of increasing his popularity and support for his calls for an executive presidency, while being able to legitimize further crackdowns on judicial independence and the opposition in general.\n\nOther elements that were reported to support the theory included: no list of demands by the coup plotters, the organization and response of the police, the long lists of arrests that seemed to be ready surprisingly quickly (including arrests of 2,745 judges and 2,839 soldiers), and the obvious nature of the coup actions.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom Erdoğan had said as being one of the principal conspirators, commented, ""I don\'t believe that the world believes the accusations made by President Erdoğan.There is a possibility that it could be a staged coup and it could be meant for further accusations [against the Gülenists].""Journalist Cengiz Çandar, a veteran observer of Turkey\'s coups, said ""I have never seen any with this magnitude of such inexplicable sloppiness.""Prominent Hizmet (Gülen movement) spokesman Alp Aslandogan said, referencing that the Turkish Air Force commander met with Erdoğan before 15 July, that certain legal documentation related to the coup seemed written beforehand, arguing that within ""the indictment written by a prosecutor on the night of 15 July to 16 July, there were events there that didn\'t actually happen.Some events did happen, but those events didn\'t happen by the time the document started.It looks like a bigger plan was there, and part of the plan did not come to pass.""\n\nThe organization and spontaneous synchronization by large numbers of mosques was perceived to be unachievable unless there had been prior preparation, with journalists also pointing to how Erdoğan could have strategically used the call to prayer to invoke religious sentiment in a political situation as a veiled attack on state secularism.\n\nThousands of arrests and purges were conducted by Turkish authorities between 16 and 18 July 2016.The sheer number of these arrests made at such a speed could only be done so if the ""Turkish government had all those lists ready"", as suggested by Johannes Hahn, European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, on 18 July 2016.Hahn also said that because these lists were already available immediately after the coup, the ""event was prepared"" and the lists were to be used ""at a certain stage"".\n\nMehmet Dişli, who was seen giving orders to the coup plotters and who was the one who put a belt around Hulusi Akar\'s neck to make him sign, is the brother of Şaban Dişli, a former vice president of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and confidant of Erdoğan.\n\nSeveral social media users have compared the coup attempt to the Reichstag fire in 1933, which Adolf Hitler used as an excuse to suspend civil liberties and order mass arrests of his opponents.Politico correspondent Ryan Heath said that ""the coup was staged to allow Erdoğan to purge the military of opponents and increase his grip on the country"".Heath used Twitter to share comments from his Turkish source, who called the events of Friday night a ""fake coup"" which would help a ""fake democracy warrior"" (referring to Erdoğan).The source said: ""Probably we\'ll see an early election [in] which he\'ll try to guarantee an unbelievable majority of the votes.And this will probably guarantee another 10–15 years of authoritarian, elected dictatorship.""\n\nThe New York Times reported that some Turkish citizens believed the coup attempt was staged by Erdoğan to improve his public image and popularity, while cracking down on political opponents and expanding his power.Critics found it suspect that reportedly no government officials were arrested or harmed during the attempted coup, which—among other factors—raised the suspicion of a false flag event staged by the Turkish government to crack down on opposition parties.Those in Turkey suggesting that the coup was staged are also being questioned by the government.\n\nPoliticians and journalists who were skeptical of the authenticity of the coup plot said that in reality, a \'civil coup\' had effectively been staged against the Armed Forces and Judiciary, both of which were extensively purged of stated Gülen supporters by the government shortly after the events.Skeptics said that the coup would be used as an excuse for further erosion of judicial independence and a crackdown on the opposition, giving the AKP greater and unstoppable power over all state institutions and paving the way for a more radical Islamist agenda at odds with the founding principles of the Turkish Republic.\n\nJustice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said in late July 2016 that Turkish social media users who said the government was staging the coup faced investigation: ""Just look at the people who are saying on social media that this was theatre.Public prosecutors are already investigating them.Most of them are losers who think it is an honor to die for Fethullah Gülen\'s command.""\n\nOn 12 July 2017, Stockholm Center for Freedom, a monitoring group with reported links to the Gülen movement, published a controversial report stating that President Erdogan orchestrated the coup bid as a false flag to consolidate his powers, set up his opposition for a mass persecution, and push Turkish Armed Forces into a military incursion into Syria.According to the report, it uncovered new evidence from 11 July 2016, four days before the planned coup bid, that a secret plan was circulated among select group of Armed Forces to give an appearance of a coup attempt.The plan was sanctioned by intelligence and military chiefs with the approval of Erdogan.\n\nIn early November 2017, Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for , former Director of the Middle East Program of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, stating that he is an agent of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), that he was present in Istanbul during the 2016 Turkish coup attempt, and that he was one of the key organizers behind the coup attempt.Around 1 December, the Istanbul prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for Graham E. Fuller, an American author and political analyst specializing in Islamic extremism after a long CIA career and holding the role of vice-chair of the United States National Intelligence Council.The prosecutor\'s office based the warrant on suspicion of Fuller helping to plan the coup attempt.Hürriyet stated that Turkish authorities believed that they had traced Fuller\'s location before the attempted coup and afterward when he left Turkey.\n\nBarkey denied his reported role in the coup, describing the claims as ""so ludicrous that they do not even deserve the term \'science fiction\'.""\n\nDeep state in Turkey The Imam\'s Army List of coups and coup attempts since 2010 List of modern conflicts in the Middle East List of attacks on legislatures\n', 'Claim_Context': 'In March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.

entrance of the Bosphorus Bridge, but failed to do so after forces and civilians loyal to the state defeated them.The Council cited an erosion of secularism, elimination of democratic rule, disregard for human rights, and Turkey\'s loss of credibility in the international arena as reasons for the coup.The government said it had evidence the coup leaders were linked to the Gülen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the Republic of Turkey and led by Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish businessman and a well-known Islamic scholar who lives in exile in Pennsylvania.The Turkish government alleged that Gülen was behind the coup (which Gülen denied) and that the United States was harboring him.Events surrounding the coup attempt and the purges in its aftermath reflect a complex power struggle between Islamist elites in Turkey.\n\nDuring the coup attempt, over 300 people were killed and more than 2,100 were injured.Many government buildings, including the Turkish Parliament and the Presidential Palace, were bombed from the air.Mass arrests followed, with at least 40,000 detained, including at least 10,000 soldiers and 2,745 judges, for being affiliated with the coup attempt.15,000 education staff were also suspended and the licenses of 21,000 teachers working at private institutions were revoked after the government stated they were loyal to Gülen.More than 77,000 people have been arrested and over 160,000 fired from their jobs, on reports of connections to Gülen.\n\nThere were many reactions against the coup attempt, both domestically and internationally.The main opposition parties in Turkey condemned the attempt, while several international leaders—such as those of the United States, NATO, the European Union, and neighboring countries—called for ""respect of the democratic institutions in Turkey and its elected officials.""Many international organizations also opposed the coup.The United Nations Security Council, however, did not denounce the coup after disagreements over the phrasing of a statement.Iran opposed the coup and advised Erdogan to defeat the coup plotters.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the head of United States Central Command, General Joseph Votel, was ""siding with coup plotters"", after Votel criticized the Turkish government for arresting the Pentagon\'s contacts in Turkey.\n\nIn March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.The same month, the British Parliament\'s Foreign Affairs Select Committee said some Gulenists were involved in the coup d\'état attempt but found no hard evidence that Fethullah Gülen masterminded the failed coup and found no evidence to justify the United Kingdom designating the Gülen movement as a ""terrorist organization"".\n\nSince the 1970s, followers of the influential cleric Fethullah Gülen had assumed increasingly important positions within the Turkish state apparatus.Gülen several times advised his followers to take key positions in society and government, if necessary with a secret identity to avoid opposition from the laicistic Turkish army and government.Nevertheless, at the start of the 21st century, Gülen\'s followers achieved crucial positions of power in Turkey (and beyond) with a vast network of newspapers, TV channels, schools, associations, lobby organizations, financial institutions and positions within the state such as the army and the judiciary.Initially, the then Prime Minister Erdogan seemingly tolerated the power of the Gülen movement because of common interests such as limiting the undemocratic political power of the military, but also because of impotence and fear of Gülen\'s power within Turkey.\n\nA series of events eventually led to a rift between Erdogan and Gülen.For example, prosecutors that allegedly were aligned with the Gülen movement tried to arrest the intelligence chief Hakan Fidan for the peace negotiations with the PKK, and by extension PM Erdogan subsequently, as the Turkish secret service is directly subordinate to the prime minister of Turkey.During this period (2010-2013), state secrets were leaked, fraud was committed with the entrance exams for government employees (KPSS), a change of power occurred at the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) and (sex)tapes of both government members and opposition members were leaked.Following these events and other incidents, the Turkish government decided to designate the Gülen movement as parallel state and FETÖ (Fethullahist Terror Organization).Alleged Gülen supporters were fired or arrested.The coup attempt that followed is therefore also described by some analysts as a last desperate attempt by Gülenists to retain power.\n\nIt is widely reported that Kemalist ideology played a huge role in motivating the 15 July 2016 coup attempt, like all previous political interventions in the history of Turkey\'s military coups.Since the establishment of multiparty democracy in Turkey in 1946, the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), together with the judiciary, have viewed themselves as guardians of Kemalist ideals and the secular Turkish nationalist state established under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk against political parties that have promoted a larger role for Islam and minorities in public life.The military and judiciary have regularly intervened in politics to block or ban popular parties representing conservative Muslim Turks, attempting to relax the restrictions on traditional religious practices, such as women\'s wearing of headscarves.The military has toppled four elected governments: by coups in 1960 and 1980, and by military decisions in 1971 and 1997.The military has also banned several major political parties.In 1998, Erdoğan, then-mayor of Istanbul, was banned for life from politics and jailed because he had read a religious poem by Ziya Gökalp several years before, at a public meeting.In 2007, the military expressed its opposition to the election of Abdullah Gül, of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), as president, by issuing an e-memorandum.Still, Gül was eventually elected when the AKP won both a referendum on the matter.Also, a snap election, and the party returned with a larger majority in the parliament.The military cited erosion of secularism as one of the reasons for the coup in the statement published on the day of the coup.\n\nAs opposed to previous political interventions by the Turkish military, Turkey\'s AKP government and pro-state media maintain that the 15 July 2016 coup attempt was not motivated by allegiance to Kemalist ideology, but rather to the vast political, economic, and religious network led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen.Between 2007 and 2012, high-profile Kemalists, including high-ranking officers of the Turkish Armed Forces, faced a series of trials and purges, under reports of involvement in a secret society codenamed ""Ergenekon.""Supported by Islamist (both pro-Gülen and pro-Erdoğan) prosecutors, security officials, and media, the purges allowed lower-rank Islamist officers to assume high-ranking military positions.They were seen as a bid by Turkey\'s civilian leaders under President Erdoğan to establish dominance over the military.In these trials in 2013 – viewed as ""sensational"" and ""one of the biggest in recent Turkish history"" – 275 people, including senior military officers, journalists, lawyers, and academics, were said to be involved in the so-called ""Ergenekon"" conspiracy, reportedly plotting a coup in 2003/04 against then–Prime Minister Erdoğan.Additionally, some military officers were said to be involved in a separate reported plot, Sledgehammer.Simultaneously, Erdoğan promoted lower-ranking officers up the chain of command, ensuring that the military chief of staff was loyal to him and thereby demoralizing the army.\n\nThe AKP\'s alliance with Gülen started to collapse during 2013 as Gülenists targeted the AKP using corruption charges.After the split, Erdoğan decided it would be advantageous to rehabilitate the army.The ""Ergenekon"" convictions were overturned in April 2016 by the Court of Cassation, which ruled that the existence of the network was unproven.\n\nIn 2013, law enforcement efforts to fight corruption, which had led to the 2013 corruption scandal in Turkey, were faulted by Erdoğan.The anti-corruption efforts were a source of tension between the Gülenists and the AKP.In political analysis in the months prior to the coup attempt, the incidence of corruption was reported to be ""rife"" in Turkey.Following the coup attempt, some coup leaders cited corruption as a reason for their actions.\n\nOn 13 July, less than two days before the coup was launched, Erdoğan signed a bill giving Turkish soldiers immunity from prosecution while taking part in domestic operations.The bill requires cases against commanders to be approved by the prime minister, while district governors may sign cases against lower-ranking soldiers.The immunity bill was seen as part of the détente between the government and the armed forces.The latter has increasingly been taking over military operations in Kurdish-inhabited areas from police and paramilitary units.\n\nOn 15 July 2016, as reported just before 23:00 EEST (UTC+3), military jets were spotted flying over Ankara, and both the Fatih Sultan Mehmet and Bosphorus bridges in Istanbul were closed.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said military action was being ""taken outside the chain of command"" and it was an ""illegal attempt"" to seize power by ""part of the military"".He further said that those involved ""will pay the highest price.""Local media also reported tanks in Istanbul\'s Atatürk Airport.It was reported that Internet users within Turkey were blocked from accessing Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.Twitter later stated that it had ""no reason to think we\'ve been fully blocked"".Some hostages were taken at military headquarters, including the Turkish Chief of the General Staff Hulusi Akar.At around 21:00, the coupists had invited Salih Zeki Çolak, the commander of the Turkish Land Forces to the military headquarters.When he arrived, he was immediately apprehended.Abidin Ünal, head of the Turkish Air Force, who had been attending a wedding in Istanbul, was abducted from there by soldiers who descended from a helicopter.The coupists then tried to force Akar to sign the coup declaration, almost strangling him using a belt in the process.He refused and was then taken to the Akıncı Air Base and other commanders at the headquarters.The military also entered the Justice and Development Party\'s offices in Istanbul and asked people to leave.\n\nEarly reports said President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was safe in Marmaris, south-west Turkey, where he had been on holiday.\n\nFrom around 23:00 to midnight, helicopters bombed the police special forces headquarters and police air force headquarters in Gölbaşı, just outside of Ankara.The attacks left 42 dead and 43 injured.Türksat headquarters in Gölbaşı was also attacked, killing two security personnel.\n\nAt around 23:50, soldiers occupied Taksim Square in central Istanbul.\n\nAt 00:02, it was reported by Reuters that soldiers were inside the buildings of the state broadcaster, the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), in Ankara.During the coup attempt, soldiers forced anchor Tijen Karaş to read out a statement saying that ""the democratic and secular rule of law has been eroded by the current government"" and that Turkey was now led by the Peace at Home Council who would ""ensure the safety of the population.""The statement read in part: ""Turkish Armed Forces have completely taken over the administration of the country to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedoms, the rule of law and general security that was damaged.[...] All international agreements are still valid.We hope that all of our good relationships with all countries will continue.""The plotters said they had ""done so to preserve democratic order, and that the rule of law must remain a priority"".The statement also ordered temporary martial law (sıkıyönetim), and said a new constitution would be prepared ""as soon as possible"".TRT was then taken off air.\n\nOther media outlets were also raided by the putschists, such as Turkish newspaper Hürriyet and private broadcaster CNN Türk.\n\nReuters reported on 15 July that an EU source described the coup as ""well orchestrated,"" and predicted that ""given the scale of the operation, it is difficult to imagine they will stop short of prevailing.""Another EU diplomat said that the Turkish ambassador in his capital was shocked and ""taking it very seriously"".\n\nThe Peace at Home Council was reportedly chaired by Muharrem Köse.\n\nAdana: Upon receiving the intelligence that thirty soldiers from the 10th Air Base Command would move to the base where the regional and provincial gendarmerie commands were located, the police prevented the soldiers from leaving the guardhouse with TOMA and armored vehicles and blocked them.Bitlis: In the Tatvan district of Bitlis, on the orders of Brigade Commander Arif Seddar Afşar, helicopters were circulated in the skies of Tatvan and fired at the city.The brigade command left the municipality\'s construction equipment in front of the barracks in case there was a tank operation in the district.Denizli: Approximately five hundred officers and non-commissioned officers who participated in the coup attempt surrendered to the gendarmerie and police forces.They were interrogated at Çardak District Gendarme Command.Kars: With the order of Kars 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, the soldiers who came with tanks and armored personnel carriers surrounded the Police Headquarters building and wanted to detain Faruk Karaduman, the chief of police.At the same hours, the invitation of Deputy Governors, 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, went to the command.Kocaeli: Turkcell\'s data center in Gebze was raided by soldiers who participated in the coup attempt.Soldiers who tried to interrupt the internet service were detained.Malatya: A rebellious soldier opened fire inside a base of the Turkish 2nd Army, damaging six vehicles.The base was besieged by police and loyal soldiers, and the shooter was captured.Marmaris: Three military helicopters carried out a bomb attack on the hotel where Erdoğan was staying.Forty rebellious soldiers of the Special Forces Command clashed with the police in the region.Mersin: Mersin Garrison and Mediterranean Region Commander Admiral Nejat Atilla Demirhan called Mersin Provincial Police Deputy Chief Yakup Usta and Gendarmerie Colonel Mustafa Bakçepınar and stated that the Turkish Armed Forces had taken over the administration.He introduced himself as the martial law garrison commander and ordered Mersin Governor Özdemir Çakacak and district governors to be taken into custody.Demirhan and Dağdelen, who made the same announcement with the police radio obtained from Mersin Police Department, were detained through the operation of the security forces.Sakarya: Sakarya Governorship was captured with armored personnel carriers, military trucks and many military jeeps from the military unit in the Kandıra district of Kocaeli.As a reinforcement, two military vehicles full of soldiers from the Sakarya central division command had to return to their barracks in the face of the resistance of the police and the harsh reaction of the people who took to the streets against the putschists.The vehicles occupying the Sakarya Governorate were seized by the citizens and the soldiers in them were neutralized and handed over to the security forces.Afterwards, citizens and security forces entered the governor\'s office and neutralized the soldiers there and suppressed the uprising in the province.Eight civilian citizens were injured as a result of the fire opened by the military during the incident.Şırnak: Çakırsöğüt Gendarmerie Commando Brigadier General Ali Osman Gürcan and 309 soldiers, that participated in the coup attempt, were detained by the security forces.\n\nTurkey\'s Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım responded to the events by stating that an ""illegal action is taking place outside of the chain of command"".He also said that ""the government elected by the people remains in charge and this government will only go when the people say so.""The Turkish Presidential office said President Erdoğan was on holiday inside Turkey and condemned the coup attempt as an attack on democracy.A presidential source also said Erdoğan and his government were still in power.The first messages from Erdoğan were transmitted at around 00:23At about 01:00, Erdoğan did a FaceTime interview with CNN Türk, in which he called upon his supporters to take to the streets in defiance of the military-imposed curfew, saying ""There is no power higher than the power of the people.Let them do what they will at the public squares and airports.""Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş appeared on live television, saying Turkey\'s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is still in charge of the government.The mayor of Ankara, Melih Gökçek of the AKP, encouraged people to go out to the city\'s streets in defiance, despite a curfew imposed by the military.Erdoğan\'s plane took off from Dalaman Airport near Marmaris at 23:47, but had to wait in the air south of Atatürk for the airport to be secured.His plane landed at 02:50\n\nThe First Army General Command in Istanbul stated in a news conference that the TSK did not support the coup and the perpetrators represented a tiny faction that were on the verge of being brought under control.Istanbul Atatürk Airport was closed; all flights from the airport were cancelled.There was an explosion in the TRT broadcasting headquarters and gunfire was reported in Ankara.Soon after, it was stormed by a crowd of civilians and police, with four soldiers inside reportedly being ""neutralized"".The channel went back on air and Karaş, who had previously announced the coup, said live that she had been held hostage and forced to read the declaration of the coup at gunpoint.\n\nBy 01:00, it was reported that the military had pulled its forces from the Atatürk airport and people were coming inside, but by 01:13, it was reported that tanks were inside the airport and gunfire was heard.\n\nTanks opened fire near the Turkish Parliament Building.The parliamentary building was also hit from the air.Injuries were reported among protesters following gunfire on Bosphorus Bridge.\n\nA helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was shot down by a Turkish military F-16 fighter jet.There were also reports of pro-state jets flying over Ankara to ""neutralize"" helicopters used by those behind the coup.\n\nAt 03:08, a military helicopter opened fire on the Turkish parliament.At 03:10, Turkish Armed Forces stated on their website that they had complete control over the country.At 03:12, Yıldırım made a statement saying that the situation was under control and that a no-fly zone was declared over Ankara and that military planes that still flew would be shot down.\n\nIt was reported that the Turkish parliament had been bombed again at 03:23 and 03:33.A helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was also seen flying by it.Half an hour following the report of 12 deaths and 2 injuries in the parliament, soldiers entered CNN Türk\'s headquarters and forced the studio to go off air.After an hour of interruption by the pro-coup soldiers, CNN Türk resumed its broadcast.Later, İsmail Kahraman said a bomb exploded at a corner of the public relations building inside the parliament, with no deaths but several injuries among police officers.\n\nAt around 04:00 two or three helicopters attacked Erdogan\'s hotel.According to eyewitness accounts, ten to fifteen heavily armed men landed and started firing.In the ensuing conflict, two policemen were killed and 8 were injured.\n\nThe Doğan News Agency reported that in Istanbul several individuals were injured after soldiers fired on a group of people attempting to cross the Bosphorus Bridge in protest of the attempted coup.\n\nOn Saturday 16 July 2016, at 00:42 EEST (UTC+3), a Turkish Black Hawk helicopter sent a distress signal and requested permission from Greek authorities for an emergency landing, and landed eight minutes later (00:50) at the Dimokritos airport in Alexandroupoli, in Greece, while two Greek F-16s observed the procedure and escorted it to the airport.The first reports said that the passengers were seven military personnel and a civilian.Later, it turned out that all were military personnel (two majors, four captains and two non-commissioned officers).They had removed the badges and insignia from their uniforms, making it impossible to know their rank.All were arrested after landing for illegal entry into the country.They were transferred to the local police station, while the Greek authorities at the airport guarded the helicopter.The eight passengers all requested political asylum in Greece as they believed they would not get a fair trial in Turkey.On 21 September 2016, Greece denied three out of the eight asylum.The men\'s lawyer Stavroula Tomara said they would be appealing the decision and said they had the ""impression that the decision has been predetermined, and that the interview was conducted just as a formality.""On 11 October 2016, four more of the eight were denied asylum.Two of the men who had previously been denied asylum applied for a re-evaluation but their applications were also rejected.\n\nAfter Erdoğan flew into Istanbul, he made a televised speech inside the airport at around 04:00, whilst thousands gathered outside.He addressed a crowd of supporters in the airport, at about 06:30 He said, ""In Turkey, armed forces are not governing the state or leading the state.They cannot.""He blamed ""those in Pennsylvania"" (a reference to Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, and his Hizmet Movement) for the coup attempt.Erdoğan also said he had plans to ""clean up"" the army, saying that ""This uprising is a gift from God to us.""State-run Anadolu Agency named former Colonel Muharrem Köse, who in March 2016 was dishonorably discharged for reported association with Gülen, as the suspected leader of the coup.However, the Alliance for Shared Values, a non-profit organization associated with Gülen, released a statement reiterating that it condemns any military intervention in domestic politics, and saying Erdoğan\'s allegations against the movement were ""highly irresponsible"".Gülen himself said in a brief statement just before midnight: ""As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nReuters reported that in early hours of 16 July, the coup appeared to have ""crumbled"" as crowds defied pro-coup military orders and gathered in major squares of Istanbul and Ankara to oppose it.Reuters also reported pro-coup soldiers surrendering to the police in Taksim Square, Istanbul.It was reported that by 05:18, Atatürk airport had completely been recaptured by the government whilst the police had surrounded the coupists inside the Turkish army headquarters, calling for them to surrender.Between 06:00–08:00 a skirmish took place there.In Akar\'s absence, Ümit Dündar, head of the First Army, was appointed Acting Chief of Staff.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning of 16 July, soldiers blocking the Bosphorus Bridge surrendered to the police.According to the government-run Anadolu Agency, this consisted of a group of 50 soldiers.Some of these soldiers were lynched by civilians despite the police\'s efforts, who fired into the air to protect the surrendering soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile, in the headquarters of the Turkish Army, 700 unarmed soldiers surrendered as the police conducted an operation into the building while 150 armed soldiers were kept inside by the police.The coupists in the TRT building in Istanbul surrendered in the early morning as well.Chief of Staff Akar, held hostage at the Akıncı Air Base in Ankara, was also rescued by pro-state forces.\n\nOne of the primary reasons that the coup failed was chaos among the plotters\' ranks.Turkey\'s National Intelligence Organization (MİT) head Hakan Fidan discovered the coup plot, and the plotters were forced to execute the coup five hours ahead of schedule.One of the main organizers, General Semih Terzi, was shot dead by loyalist Sgt.Maj.Ömer Halisdemir at the onset, demoralizing and disrupting command and control of the rebels.These two incidents resulted in the coup being carried out in an uncoordinated manner.The highest ranking staff officers opposed the coup, and publicly ordered all personnel to return to their barracks.Acting outside the military chain of command, the rebels lacked the coordination and resources to achieve their goals.The conscripted soldiers that the rebels mobilized were uninformed of their mission\'s true purpose and became demoralized.Many surrendered rather than shoot demonstrators.The commander of the First Army in Istanbul, General Ümit Dündar, personally called Erdoğan to warn him of the plot, persuading him to evacuate his hotel ahead of the plotters, and helped to secure Istanbul for Erdoğan to land.The MİT also mobilized its anti-aircraft guns, which the plotters were unaware existed, deterring rebel jets and commando teams.\n\nEqually important to the coup\'s failure, according to military strategist Edward N. Luttwak, was the inability of the rebels to neutralize Erdoğan and other high ranking government officials, either by killing or detaining them.A unit of special forces was sent via helicopter to kill or capture the president, but missed because he had been evacuated by his security detail just minutes before.Once Erdoğan landed at Atatürk International Airport (which had been recaptured from the rebels by his supporters), It became highly unlikely that the coup attempt would succeed.According to a military source, several rebel F-16s targeted Erdoğan\'s presidential jet en route to Istanbul, but they did not fire.A senior Turkish counter-terrorism official later stated that the jets did not fire because the fighter jet pilots were told by President Erdoğan\'s pilot over the radio that the (flight of the) Gulfstream IV was a Turkish Airlines flight.\n\nAccording to Naunihal Singh, author of Seizing Power, the coup attempt also failed because the plotters failed to secure control of the media and shape the narrative.Successful coups require that the rebels control the mass media.This allows even small rebel contingents to portray themselves as fully in control, and their victory as inevitable.Consequently, they convince the public, along with neutral and even loyalist soldiers, to defect to them or not resist.The rebels failed to properly broadcast their messages effectively across the media that they controlled.They failed to capture Türksat, Turkey\'s main cable and satellite communications company, and failed to gain control of the country\'s television and mobile phone networks.This allowed Erdoğan to make his Facetime call, and to speak on television.\n\nOther scholars of civil-military relations, like Drew H. Kinney, have said reports like Luttwak and Singh\'s miss the point of their own analysis: civil resistance thwarted the coup.Luttwak argues that wayward elements of the Turkish armed forces could not silence Erdoğan.Singh says that the rebels could not project success because they couldn\'t control the message.Kinney states that neither of these reasons on their own matter, but rather it\'s their effect—civil disobedience—that is important.We might find that ""[Gülen\'s movement] ...[might] have had nothing to do with the attempted takeover in July, but civilians [nevertheless] definitely played a role in thwarting the coup,"" writes Kinney.""...[A]n unhappy civilian populace mobilized to face down the military.""\n\nErdoğan wasn\'t censored (Luttwak\'s point) and was therefore able to use FaceTime to mobilize resistance, which in turn hindered the conspirators\' ability to project success (Singh\'s point).The result is civilian resistance to soldiers, i.e., people power.The reason Singh, Luttwak, and other scholars of civil-military relations miss this is, according to Kinney, because they ""usually do not study extra-military reasons for coup failures/successes,"" but rather put a premium on ""the inner-workings of the [military] operation.""In short, they blame the military for its failure rather than acknowledge the power of the masses and their successes.\n\nPro-state forces sent text messages to every Turkish citizen calling for them to protest against the coup attempt.Throughout the night sela prayers were repeatedly called from mosque minarets across the country to encourage people to resist the coup plotters.While the sela is usually called from minarets to inform the public of a funeral, they are also traditionally performed to notify of a significant event, in this case ""to rally people"".\n\nThe coup plotters initiated their operation hours ahead of the planned time when they understood that their plans had been compromised.Had the coup been launched at its original time, the middle of the night, much of the population would have been asleep.The streets would have been mostly empty.\n\nReports have emerged, neither confirmed nor denied by Russia or Turkey that the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate intercepted signals on an imminent coup passed on to loyal Turkish operatives.The intercepted plans revealed several helicopters with commandos were on the way to Marmaris\'s coastal resort, where Erdoğan stayed, capturing or killing him.Pre-warned, Erdoğan left quickly to avoid them.\n\nAn extensive purge of the Turkish civil service began in the wake of the coup attempt, with President Erdoğan warning his opponents that ""they will pay a heavy price for this.""The New York Times along with some other Western media such as The Economist, described the purges as a ""counter-coup"", with the Times expecting the president to ""become more vengeful and obsessed with control than ever, exploiting the crisis not just to punish mutinous soldiers but to further quash whatever dissent is left in Turkey,"".As of 20 July 2016, the purge already had seen over 45,000 military officials, police officers, judges, governors and civil servants arrested or suspended, including 2,700 judges, 15,000 teachers, and every university dean in the country.\n\n163 generals and admirals were detained, around 45% of the Turkish military\'s total.\n\nOn 18 July 2016, United States State Secretary John Kerry urged Turkish authorities to halt the increasing crackdown on its citizens, indicating that the crackdown was meant to ""suppress dissent.""French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault voiced concern, warning against a ""political system which turns away from democracy"" in response to the purges.\n\nOn 17 August 2016, Turkey started releasing what was expected to eventually amount to about 38,000 prison inmates, to make more space in the penal system for detainees, numbering about 35,000, who were arrested or detained after being involved in or suspected of association, with the 2016 failed coup.\n\nOn 28 September 2016, Turkish justice minister Bekir Bozdağ said 70,000 people had been processed and 32,000 were formally arrested.\n\nMajor General Cahit Bakir, who commanded Turkish forces under NATO in Afghanistan, and Brigadier General Sener Topuc, responsible for education and aid in Afghanistan, were detained by authorities in Dubai connected with the failed coup.\n\nGeneral Akın Öztürk, former Commander of the Turkish Air Force, was the Turkish military attaché to Israel.He was arrested on charges of having played a leading role in the failed coup.Öztürk has denied the charges.\n\nGeneral Adem Huduti, the commander of the Second Army, positioned along the southern borders with Syria and Iraq, and General Erdal Öztürk, the commander of the 3rd Corps, were also arrested.\n\nRear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been stationed at NATO\'s Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk, Virginia, sought asylum in the United States after being recalled by the Turkish government.\n\nIn July 2018, Istanbul\'s 25th Criminal Court sentenced 72 former soldiers involved in the coup attempt to life in prison.\n\nOn 20 June 2019, a terrorism court in Turkey sentenced 151 people to life in prison, including General Akın Öztürk, former commander of Turkish Air Force and the most senior officer involved in the coup.128 people received ""aggravated life"" sentences, which indicates harsh conditions without parole, for their role in the coup, with another 23 receiving standard life sentences.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom President Erdoğan said as one of the principal conspirators, condemned the coup attempt and denied any role in it.""I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey,"" he said in an emailed statement reported by The New York Times.""Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force.I pray to God for Turkey, Turkish citizens, and all those currently in Turkey that this situation is resolved peacefully and quickly.As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nPresident Erdoğan asked the United States to extradite Gülen: ""I call on you again, after there was a coup attempt.Extradite this man in Pennsylvania to Turkey!If we are strategic partners or model partners, do what is necessary.""Prime Minister Yildirim has threatened war against any country that would support Gülen.Turkish Labor Minister Süleyman Soylu said that ""America is behind the coup.""\n\nRegarding the AKP\'s statement against Gülen, Secretary of State Kerry invited the Turkish government ""to present us with any legitimate evidence that withstands scrutiny,"" before they would accept an extradition request.\n\nOn 15 August 2016, former United States diplomat James Jeffrey, who was the United States ambassador to Turkey from 2008 until 2010 made the following remarks: ""The Gülen movement has some infiltration at the least in the military that I am aware of.They of course had extreme infiltration into the police and judiciary earlier.I saw that when I was in Turkey previously, particularly in the Sledgehammer case, Hakan Fidan case, and the corruption cases in 2013.Obviously, significant segment of Turkey\'s bureaucracy was infiltrated and had their allegiance to a movement.That of course is absolutely unacceptable and extremely dangerous.It likely led to the coup attempt.""\n\nOutside Turkey, in Beringen, Belgium, anti-coup protesters attempted to attack a building owned by the pro-Gülen movement group \'Vuslat\'.The police brought in a water cannon to keep the attackers at bay.In news articles it was stated that the police also protected the houses of Gülen supporters.People advocated on social media to go to Beringen once more, and there was unrest in Heusden-Zolder, elsewhere in Belgium.Furthermore, in Somalia the government ordered ""the total closure of all activities"" of an organization linked to the Gülen movement, and gave its staff seven days to leave the country.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, President Erdoğan said Western countries were ""supporting terrorism"" and the military coup, saying ""I\'m calling on the United States: what kind of strategic partners are we, that you can still host someone whose extradition I have asked for?""\n\nOn 31 January 2017, British Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, Alan Duncan said he believed the Gülen movement was responsible for the coup attempt.Duncan went on saying ""the organization which incorporated itself into the state tried to topple the democratic structure in Turkey"".\n\nIn a speech on 29 July 2016, President Erdoğan said U.S. Central Command chief Joseph Votel was ""siding with coup plotters""; Erdoğan said the United States was protecting Fethullah Gülen, whom the Turkish government blames for the coup attempt.Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim made similar comments.In response, Votel said that the Turkish government\'s statements were ""unfortunate and completely inaccurate"" and expressed concern that the mass arrests and firings of military officers would damage military cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey.Similarly, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said that the Turkish military purges were impairing the fight against ISIS.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, in an escalation of tensions with the United States, Erdoğan questioned Turkey\'s relationship with the United States and criticized the West, saying that ""script"" for the abortive putsch last month was ""written abroad"".Erdoğan stated that he had personally asked Obama to extradite Gülen to Turkey.When the U.S. government replied it would need evidence of the cleric\'s guilt before extradition, to which Erdoğan said: ""When you asked for the return of a terrorist, we did not ask for documentation. ...Let us put him on trial.""\n\nYeni Şafak daily, a Turkish pro-state newspaper, stated that the former commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, now-retired United States Army General John F. Campbell, was the ""mastermind"" behind the coup attempt in Turkey.Campbell called the statement ""absolutely ridiculous"" and President Obama said ""Any reports that we had any previous knowledge of a coup attempt, that there was any U.S. involvement in it, that we were anything other than entirely supportive of Turkish democracy are completely false, unequivocally false.""\n\nOn 1 December 2017, Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for American political analyst, former CIA official and former vice chairman of US National Intelligence Council Graham Fuller, stating his involvement in the coup.A career US State Department official who was once CIA Station Chief in Kabul and later went on to be a political scientist in Rand Corporation specializing in the Middle East, Turkish authorities said Fuller attended a meeting in Istanbul on 15 July 2016 involving organization and coordination of the botched coup.Another American among the attendance, as stated by the Turkish prosecutors, was academic Henri Barkey who was named a suspect a week after the failed coup.\n\nThe U.S. consulate in Turkey issued an advisory to U.S. citizens to avoid the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey, which houses about 50 nuclear bombs, until ""normal operations have been restored"".They stated that local authorities were denying access to the air base and that power supplying the air base was shut off.\n\nThe Incirlik base is important to the U.S.-led effort in Syria to combat ISIL and other militants.Nearly 1,500 American personnel are housed in the base.\n\nTwenty-four hours after initial reports that the air base was shut down, United States defense department officials confirmed that the base and its airspace had re-opened to military aircraft and that operations by American aircraft will resume.The Turkish commander of the air base, brig.Gen. Bekir Ercan Van was arrested.After the failure of the coup Gen Bekir Ercan Van sought asylum from the U.S., but his request was denied by U.S.\n\nFollowing the failed coup attempt multiple media outlets have published editorials advocating the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Incirlik Air base as Turkey is unstable.\n\nOn 16 July, anti-coup protesters chanted against locals in areas of Istanbul with high concentration of Alevis, including Okmeydanı and Gazi.Such incidents also occurred in a quarter of Antakya with a high Alevi population, where a motorcyclist stating to be a sharia advocate was lynched.In a neighbourhood of Ankara, shops belonging to Syrians were attacked by a mob.In Malatya, Sunni Islamists harassed residents of an Alevi neighbourhood, particularly the women, and attempted to enter the neighbourhood en masse.Police intervened and blocked all roads leading there.In Kadıköy, people drinking alcohol in public were attacked by a group of religious fundamentalists.\n\nFollowing the arrests, thousands of anti-coup protesters demanded instituting the death penalty against detainees connected with the coup, chanting ""we want the death penalty"".President Erdoğan has been open to reinstituting the death penalty, noting that ""in a democracy, whatever the people want they will get.""Turkish authorities have not executed anyone since 1984, but legally abolished capital punishment only in 2004 as a pre-condition to join the European Union.\n\nEuropean Union officials have been vocal about their opposition to purges by Turkish authorities in connection to the coup.French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that Turkey must work within the framework of the law to uphold Europe\'s democratic principles.Furthermore, on 18 July 2016, Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of Foreign Affairs of the European Union, announced that no country will be admitted into the European Union ""if it introduces the death penalty"".Moreover, German press secretary, Steffen Seibert, stated that reinstituting the death penalty will end Turkey\'s accession talks with the European Union.\n\nTurkey is a member of the Council of Europe, and ratified the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) as part of its terms of membership.The ECHR is an international treaty that includes the abolition of the death penalty among its terms.As such, Turkey is legally bound not to reintroduce the death penalty.\n\nOn 20 July 2016, President Erdoğan announced a three-month state of emergency in response to the attempted coup, invoking Article 120 of the Constitution of Turkey (""Declaration of state of emergency because of widespread acts of violence and serious deterioration of public order"").Under the state of emergency, under Article 121, ""the Council of Ministers, meeting under the chairpersonship of the President of the Republic, may issue decrees having the force of law on matters necessitated by the state of emergency"", with decrees subject to subsequent parliamentary approval.The state of emergency was endorsed by the Parliament on 21 July by 346 votes to 115.The Justice and Development Party and the Nationalist Movement Party supported the state of emergency, whilst the Republican People\'s Party and the Peoples\' Democratic Party opposed it.Prime Minister Yıldırım said at the Parliament that the state of emergency was necessary to ""get rid of this scourge rapidly"".\n\nAs part of the state of emergency, deputy prime minister Kurtulmuş announced that Turkey was temporarily suspending part of the European Convention on Human Rights following the attempted coup, invoking Article 15 of the Convention (""war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation"").The suspensions must be notified to the Council of Europe and may not affect the right to a fair trial or the prohibition on torture.\n\nThis state of emergency in Turkey as well as the hindrance of the right to protest that occurred within such framework have been layered onto a longer history of emergency rules, oppressive legislation and daily government practice that have reinforced both.We can see from this the ""autocratisation"" process in Turkey has thrived of existing legal framework deeply associated in legacies of past ""emergencies"".\n\nOn 3 October 2016 Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş declared the governments intention to extend the state of emergency by a further three months raising objections from both the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) and Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) were critical of the governments use of their emergency powers and declared that they would vote against an extension.\n\nFollowing the National Security Council\'s recommendation for the extension President Erdoğan stated that it was possible that the state of emergency could last for longer than a year prompting outcry from the opposition, Leader of the Main Opposition Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu said that ""The president saying that the state of emergency can last longer than 12 months is strengthening the fear of a counter-coup"" and that it was ""raising the prospect of opportunist measures.""\n\nThe AKP\'s governmental majority allowed the three-month extension to take effect on 19 October 2016.The two-year-long state of emergency was ended on 19 July 2018.\n\nOn 16 July 2016, the media reported that eight Turkish military personnel of various ranks had landed in Greece\'s northeastern city of Alexandroupolis on board a Black Hawk helicopter and claimed political asylum in Greece.While the Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu demanded extradition of ""the eight traitors as soon as possible"", the Greek authorities stated: ""We will follow the procedures of international law.However, we give severe considerations to the fact that [the Turkish military men] are accused, in their own country, of violating the constitutional order and trying to overthrow democracy.""The helicopter was returned to Turkey shortly thereafter.The eight asylum seekers, their asylum case pending, were later transferred to Athens, mainly for safety reasons.On 26 January, the Supreme Court of Greece eventually ruled against their extradition, on the grounds that the eight were unlikely to face a fair trial if returned to their home country and due to concerns over their safety.\n\nOn 15 February 2017, five Turkish commandos illegally entered Greece through the Evros river.However, once they entered the country, the group split.The two of them surrendered to the police and on 20 February 2017, requested political asylum.They were being held in the city of Alexandroupolis.The two men belonged to the Turkish navy.The names given by the two reportedly match the names of two fugitives wanted in relation to the shadowy operation against Erdoğan himself.The Greek government mentioned that the Greek authorities will not allow the country to be dragged into the ongoing feud between the Turkish state and the followers of Gulen.But there were no sign of the other three.According to a lawyer there were indications that the other three have been arrested by Greek authorities who were about to expel them to Turkey.According to new evidence and new information these three ""arrested"" marines were delivered under fast and informal procedures from Greek to Turkish services.\n\nAfter the coup attempt, two Turkish military attachés in Athens, Staff Col. İlhan Yaşıtlı and naval attaché Col. Halis Tunç, had reportedly disappeared along with their families.The Greek foreign ministry canceled the two attachés\' accreditations on 7 August 2016, upon the request of the Turkish foreign ministry.Greek media reported that they might have fled to Italy.On 11 August 2016, the Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu confirmed the reports saying that they had left Greece for Italy on 6 August and adding that Turkey would officially ask the Italian authorities to extradite the two soldiers.\n\nOn 9 August 2016, the media reported that Turkey\'s Rear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been on a United States-based assignment for NATO and after the coup was subject to a detention order in Turkey, had sought asylum in the United States.\n\nIn mid-November 2016, it was officially confirmed that about 40 Turkish military servicemen of various ranks stationed at NATO command structures had applied for asylum in Germany and Belgium.\n\nIn January 2017, Der Spiegel magazine and ARD broadcaster reported that about 40 mostly high-ranking Turkish soldiers who worked at NATO facilities in Germany requested asylum in Germany.\n\nAt the end of February 2017, Germany said it had received 136 asylum requests from Turks holding diplomatic passports since the July coup attempt.The figure was a total for August 2016 to January 2017; some were presumed to be military officers posted to NATO bases in Germany.\n\nIn November 2016, NATO\'s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that Turkish NATO Officers had requested asylum in the countries where they had been posted.He did not name the nations involved or the number of officers, saying it was a matter for those countries to decide.He said: ""Some Turkish officers working in NATO command structure ... have requested asylum in the countries where they are working. ...As always, this is an issue that is going to be assessed and decided by the different NATO allies as a national issue.""\n\nAs of March 2017, Norway have granted asylum for four Turkish soldiers and a military attache.\n\nSeveral Turkish citizens with diplomatic passports have sought political asylum in Switzerland.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, detainees in Turkey have been denied access to legal counsel, have been beaten and tortured.They have not been provided with adequate food, water, or medical care.At least one has attempted suicide.Amnesty International wanted the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture to send people to check on detainees conditions.A person who had been on duty at the Ankara police headquarters said that police denied medical treatment to a detainee.""Let him die.We will say he came to us dead,"" the witness quoted a police doctor as saying.\n\nAlso, Erdoğan has extended the maximum period of detention for suspects from four days to 30, a move Amnesty said increased the risk of torture or other maltreatment of detainees.\n\nTurkish Justice Ministry denied the reports and the Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said on his Twitter account: ""There has not been any torture or assault of detainees in custody,"" in response to reports by Amnesty International.""The claims of torture and assault make up a pre-packaged misinformation campaign formed by members of FETÖ, one which is untrue and distorted,""\n\nOn 7 August, between three and five million people gathered for an anti-coup rally organized by the Turkish authorities in Istanbul.President Erdoğan and the two leaders of the major opposition parties (the Republican People\'s Party and the Nationalist Movement Party) were present.\n\nGreek authorities on several Aegean islands have called for emergency measures to curtail a growing flow of refugees from Turkey; the number of migrants and refugees willing to make the journey across the Aegean has increased noticeably after the failed coup.At Athens officials voiced worries because Turkish monitors overseeing the deal in Greece had been abruptly pulled out after the failed coup without being replaced.Also, the mayor of Kos expressed concern in a letter to the Greek Prime Minister citing the growing influx of refugees and migrants after the failed coup.The Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises (SETE) warned about the prospect of another flare-up in the refugee/migrant crisis due to the Turkish political instability.\n\nVincent Cochetel, the director of the Europe Bureau of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in August 2016 that parts of the EU-Turkey deal about immigration were already de facto suspended because no Turkish police were present at Greek detention centres to oversee deportations.\n\nOn 25 August 2016, seven Turkish citizens sought asylum in Greece.Two were university professors, and their two children applied for asylum in Alexandroupoli after they illegally entered the country from the northeastern border.Also, three businessmen illegally reached the Greek island of Rhodes, and they also applied for asylum.\n\nOn 30 August 2016, a Turkish judge arrived at the Greek island of Chios on a migrant boat, with six Syrian nationals, and sought asylum in the country.He told the Greek coastguard and police officers that he is being persecuted in Turkey for his political beliefs by President Tayyip Erdoğan.The Turkish judge had been arrested for illegally entering the country and was transferred to Athens for his asylum proceedings.The Syrian nationals claimed refugee status.\n\nOn 11 September 2016, four Turkish civilians were arrested by Turkish police.An academic and a teacher attempted to escape to Greece illegally by crossing the Evros river, and the other two because they organized the escape attempt.The academic and the teacher paid a total of 12,500 euros in Istanbul to arrange their escape to Greece.Before their attempt, both the academic and the teacher were suspended from their duties as part of the ongoing probe into the failed coup attempt.Police also seized an air raft, an oar and a pump while detaining the suspects.The court later ordered the two\'s release while the other two suspects, who organized the escape attempt, were arrested.\n\nOn 21 September 2016, ten Turkish civilians, two men, two women and six children landed by boat illegally on the Greek island of Rhodes and sought asylum.They told the Greek authorities they were working in the private sector in Turkey and the Turkish government was persecuting them due to their political beliefs.\n\nOn 29 September 2016, five Turkish nationals, a couple and their child and two other men, arrived in Greece, at Alexandroupolis by crossing the Evros River by boat illegally and requested political asylum.\n\nOn 12 December 2016, one female Turkish national, landed by boat, full of refugees and immigrants, illegally on the Greek island of Lesbos.She requested political asylum.\n\nOn 24 October 2017, Turkish authorities obtained information that 995 Turks have applied for asylum in Greece after the coup attempt.\n\nMore than 1,800 Turkish citizens requested asylum in Greece in 2017.\n\nOn 18 February 2018, seventeen Turkish nationals, including six children, requested asylum in Greece at Oinousses island.\n\nIn August 2018, the former lawmaker for the Peoples\' Democratic Party, Leyla Birlik, requested asylum in Greece after illegally crossing the border near Alexandroupolis.\n\nBerlin mayor, Michael Müller (SPD), said Turkey was waging war on supporters of the Gülen movement in Germany.He said that Turkish officials had approached him and asked him whether he would be prepared to confront the Gülen movement in Berlin critically and, if necessary, to support measures against it.The mayor rejected the idea and made it very clear that Turkish conflicts could not be waged in the city.\n\nDer Spiegel presented classified documents, which showed that Turkey\'s secret service (MIT) had asked Germany\'s foreign intelligence agency (BND) for help in rounding up Gülen supporters in Germany.The Turkish secret service wanted the BND to use its influence to spur German lawmakers into taking action against Gülen supporters and extraditing them to Turkey.Also, Turkey\'s government has sent German authorities requests for searches and extraditions linked to supporters of Fethullah Gülen in Germany.\n\nIn Germany businesses thought to be in support of the Gülen movement have been harassed by Erdoğan supporters.\n\nAfter the failed coup, there was a massive demonstration in Cologne at Germany, in late July, in support of Turkish President Erdoğan.Erdoğan wanted to address the participants via video but was rejected by the local authorities and the German Constitutional Court due to security concerns.Turkey said that the ban was unacceptable and a violation of freedom of expression.\n\nGerman authorities said Turkish mosques in Germany were playing Turkish politics and worried that Turkey\'s internal politics spilled over into German cities.For years, German authorities had encouraged Turkey\'s state-run religious institution Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs usually referred to as DİTİB to provide Islamic preachers and teachers and Gülen Movement Schools for the large Turkish diaspora in Germany.DİTİB manages some 900 mosques in Germany.Gülen movement runs 100 educational facilities in Germany.\n\nAfter the failed coup DİTİB published a sermon praising ""our noble nation"" for rising against ""a wretched network"" that had sown ""seeds of sedition, rebellion and hostility.""According to Volker Beck, a member of the center-left Greens in Germany\'s Bundestag, ""That was not a religious text.It was a declaration of obedience to Mr. Erdoğan and his measures since the coup attempt,"" Volker Kauder, parliamentary group leader of the Germany\'s ruling Christian Democrats, the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU)/Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) faction, said Turkish-Germans should be loyal to Germany first and foremost.\n\nGermans of Turkish origin are being pressured in Germany by informers and officers of Turkey\'s MIT spy agency.According to reports Turkey had 6,000 informants plus MIT officers in Germany who were putting pressure on ""German Turks"".Hans-Christian Ströbele said that there was an ""unbelievable"" level of ""secret activities"" in Germany by Turkey\'s MIT agency.According to Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, not even the former communist East German Stasi secret police had managed to run such a large ""army of agents"" in the former West Germany: ""Here, it\'s not just about intelligence gathering, but increasingly about intelligence service repression.""\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nGermany\'s Office for Migration and Refugees said on 18 November 2016, it had received 4,437 political asylum requests from Turkish citizens up to October, compared to 1,767 for the whole of last year.""We must expect that the number of Turks who are seeking political asylum in Germany will continue to rise,"" said Stephan Mayer, the domestic policy speaker of the union coalition in the Bundestag.\n\nOn 10 December 2016, eleven Turkish nationals, 10 adults and one child, in a martial arts group have applied for asylum in Germany.\n\nAs of January 2018, Germany was first place and Greece second as EU destinations of choice for Turkish nationals requesting asylum after the coup attempt.\n\nTurkish police have carried out simultaneous raids in 18 cities against companies associated with United States-based Fethullah Gülen.The state-run Anadolu Agency said police searched 204 premises and detained 187 businessmen for ""membership in a terror organization"" and ""providing financial support to a terror organization"".All suspects\' assets were seized.\n\nWikiLeaks released Turkish emails and documents to respond to the Turkish government\'s purges that followed the coup attempt.In turn, the Turkish Telecommunications Communications Board blocked access to the WikiLeaks website.On 17 July 2016 Wikileaks had announced on Twitter, the leak of approximately 300,000 emails and over 500,000 documents, including those to and from AKP.\n\nWikiLeaks stated that it was attacked shortly after 17 July announcement of the planned publication and hypothesized that Turkish authorities were responsible.WikiLeaks stated in a tweet, ""our infrastructure is under sustained attack.""Tweets from WikiLeaks include ""We are unsure of the true origin of the attack.The timing suggests a Turkish state power faction or its allies.We will prevail & publish.""and: ""Turks will likely be censored to prevent them reading our pending release of 100k+ docs on politics leading up to the coup."", ""We ask that Turks are ready with censorship bypassing systems such as TorBrowser and uTorrent""; ""And that everyone else is ready to help them bypass censorship and push our links through the censorship to come.""\n\nUpon the release of the email dump, it has been reported that the emails contain little to no damning information, and instead are just mails from a public mailing list, but also linked externally to ""voter information on all of the women registered to vote in 78 out of Turkey\'s 81 provinces"".\n\nSeveral places were renamed to commemorate the failed coup: Boğaziçi Köprüsü (Bosphorus Bridge) → 15 Temmuz Şehitler Köprüsü Kızılay Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Kızılay Demokrasi Meydanı Ahmet Taner Kışlalı Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Milli İrade Meydanı (Reverted to original name a few days later) Büyük İstanbul Otogarı → İstanbul 15 Temmuz Demokrasi Otogarı In TRT, Yeni Haber Stüdyosu → 15 Temmuz Millet Stüdyosu Kazan → Kahramankazan about the province\'s local people\'s resistance to the coup plotters.Kahraman means ""hero"" in Turkish Niğde University → Niğde Ömer Halisdemir University\n\nIn 2018, the Istanbul Municipal Council decided to change the names of a total of 90 streets that included words which could be associated with FETÖ.\n\nThe Presidency of Religious Affairs stated that it would not be providing religious funeral services to the dead coupists, except for ""privates and low-ranking officers compelled by force and threats who found themselves in the midst of the conflict without full knowledge of anything"".\n\nA document dated 26 September 2016 showed that Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) asked Turkish missions and religious representatives abroad to profile Gülen movement expatriates living in their respective foreign countries.Gülen-linked schools, businesses, foundations, associations, media outlets and others were also included in the reports.Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs has gathered intelligence via imams from 38 countries.\n\nBelgium officials said they would withdraw recognition of Diyanet mosques in the country if necessary.\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nOn 21 December 2016, the Turkish government has recalled Yusuf Acar, the religious affairs attaché of the Turkish Embassy in the Netherlands, after Dutch authorities said he was spying.Acar collected information of people who sympathize with Fethullah Gülen at Netherlands and passed it on to the Turkish authorities.The Dutch government called spying activities an ""unwanted and non-acceptable interference in the lives of Dutch citizens.""and the attaché was reportedly declared persona non grata and received a ""deportation warning"" by Dutch authorities.\n\nOn 26 January 2017, President Erdoğan, during his visit to Tanzania, asked his Tanzanian counterpart John Magufuli to take action against the network of Fethullah Gülen.\n\nIn April 2017 it was announced that President Erdoğan planned to establish a purpose-built museum dedicated to the coup events, called the ""Museum of the 15 July: Martyrs and Democracy"", to be located in Kahramankazan, a town near Ankara.Paid for by Turkish Ministry of Culture funds, it is planned to open at the end of 2018.The museum opened in December 2019\n\nAmong the Turkish opposition parties, the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) issued a statement expressing their public opposition to the coup, and the Hürriyet Daily News reported that Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bahçeli telephoned Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım to express his opposition to the coup.The co-chairs of the opposition Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) issued a statement saying that the party was ""under all circumstances and as a matter of principle against all kinds of coup.""Amongst the minor parties, left-wing nationalist Patriotic Party\'s Doğu Perinçek backed democracy, when he held Gülen and the Americans responsible.Kurdish militant separatist organization Kurdistan Workers\' Party, which Turkey and its allies label as a terrorist organization, urged their supporters to stay away from the coup and rather defend their people, while the Communist Party called upon the people to overthrow the AKP government which they called an ""enemy of humanity"".\n\nDuring the first hours of the coup plotters\' moves of blocking Istanbul\'s bridges and flying fighter jets low over Istanbul and Ankara, Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjørn Jagland tweeted against the coup attempt and underlined that ""any attempt to overthrow the democratically elected leaders is unacceptable"".\n\nRussia\'s President Vladimir Putin called Erdoğan out of solidarity before all NATO member countries\' heads following the coup attempt.Erdoğan thanked the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev – who was the first president to show solidarity after the coup attempt – for his support in solving the 7-month crisis over downed Russian Sukhoi Su-24 and the Prime Minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, who was among the first NATO country leaders to condemn the coup attempt, already from the early hours of Saturday.\n\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the then prime minister of Pakistan, was all praise for the people of Turkey and the AKP government and strongly condemned what he termed as an attempt to undermine democracy in Turkey.""We deeply admire the resolve of the brave and resilient Turkish people, who stood up against the forces of darkness and anarchy to express their support and commitment to democracy,"" the PM said in a statement issued from his office.\n\nThe majority of countries either expressed their support for the government or called for restraint.On 16 July 2016, however, a proposed United Nations Security Council statement denouncing the coup was not accepted by Egypt, a non-permanent member of the Council at the time, due to textual disagreements.Egyptian diplomats said that the council is ""in no position to qualify, or label [the Turkish] government – or any other government for that matter – as democratically elected or not"".Objection by the United States and the UK – permanent members of the Security Council – led to Egypt proposing a new statement calling for all sides to ""respect the democratic and constitutional principles and the rule of law"", which was rejected, preventing the condemnation of the coup attempt by the Security Council.The leader of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky supported the coup attempt.\n\nAl-Monitor reported that ""Unlike Ankara\'s Western allies, Iran did not wait for the coup\'s failure to speak up.Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif voiced support for democracy in a Twitter message in the early hours of the unrest, writing ""Stability, and democracy in Turkey are paramount"".In a subsequent phone call after the failure of the coup attempt, President Hassan Rouhani told Erdoğan the coup attempt was ""a test to identify your domestic and foreign friends and enemies.""An Iranian official pointed out parallels between the coup attempt in Turkey and the coup against Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mussadiq in 1953: ""What we know is that this attempt was triggered by foreign hands.We have experienced the same thing in the past.Since Mr. Erdogan wants to play a more positive path in the region today, they want to overthrow him.""\n\nMustafa Akıncı, President of Northern Cyprus, welcomed the fact that ""no community in Turkey ... applauded the coup as they have done in the past.""Azerbaijan strongly condemned the attempted military coup in Turkey and considered such actions unacceptable according to a statement from Novruz Mammadov, deputy head of the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration and chief of the foreign relations department.\n\nEuropean Commissioner dealing with Turkey\'s EU membership bid, Johannes Hahn, said it appears Turkey\'s government prepared arrest lists of political opponents before the coup attempt and had been waiting for the right time to act.In this sense, EU reported that as a main criticism to put this issue in the category of terrorism become the violation of the fundamental rights and fundamental values of the citizens.Hence, it underlines a total divergence of opinions and mentality between EU and Turkey which reached a deadlock here especially after the 15th of July in 2016.\n\nOn 19 July 2016, White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said during a press briefing that President Barack Obama has held a phone conversation with President Erdoğan: ""The President used the phone call to reiterate once again the strong commitment of the United States to the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey.The President pledged any needed assistance to the Turkish government as they conduct an investigation to determine exactly what happened.""\n\nOn 20 July 2016, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""Turkey has a large armed force, professional armed forces and ...I am certain they will continue as a committed and strong NATO ally.""On a statement released on 10 August 2016, the Secretary General once more strongly condemned the attempted coup and reiterated full support for Turkey\'s democratic institutions.He also expressed support for the elected Turkish government and respect for the courage of the Turkish people for resisting the coup plotters.\n\nOn 29 July 2016, the commander of U.S. Central Command, General Joseph Votel, denied statements by Turkey\'s president Erdoğan that he has supported the coup attempt in Turkey.\n\nOn 1 August 2016, United States Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, General Joseph Dunford, visited Turkey and condemned the coup attempt.Dunford said: ""The consistent theme throughout the day was a reaffirmation of the importance of the U.S.-Turkey relationship – the need for us to cooperate.""\n\nOn July, 20, there were reports that a group of Turkish military commandos coup fugitives would try to cross from Turkey to the island of Symi, in the southeastern Aegean, at Greece.The Hellenic Coast Guard was on alert and increased the patrols in the area, especially after a group of inflatable dinghies and other vessels were seen departing from Datça, on the Turkish coast, in the direction of Symi, they monitored the movements of the Turkish vessels, which remained in Turkish waters.Furthermore, a contingent of the Hellenic Police was dispatched to Symi to conduct checks there.The Greek government had been anticipating a possible attempt by participants in the failed coup to come to Greece and took the reports seriously.Turkish F-16 fighter jets were also scrambled to check reports that missing Turkish coast guard vessels had appeared in Greek waters in the Aegean.Later on the day, the Turkish interior ministry denied reports that rebel soldiers might have ""hijacked"" a vessel to flee to Greece.The Greek armed forces remained on alert the throughout the day for potential coup fugitives.\n\nAccording to Michael Rubin, from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Erdoğan had himself to blame for the coup.Following an increasingly Islamist agenda, Erdoğan had reportedly ""dropped any pretense of governing for all Turks.""After ""fanning the flames"" at the 2013 Gezi Park protests, he transformed the predominantly Kurdish-inhabited areas of southeastern Turkey ""into a war zone reminiscent of the worst days of the 1980s.""The biggest problem, according to Rubin, might have been Erdoğan\'s foreign policy, which managed to turn the initial ""no problems with neighbors"" doctrine into a situation where the country has problems with almost every neighbor and has even alienated some of its allies and friends.Rubin previously worked as an official at the Pentagon and less than 4 months before the coup, he wrote an article in Newsweek magazine titled, ""Will There Be a Coup Against Erdogan in Turkey?""\n\nBritish Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk warned that ""too late did Erdoğan realize the cost of the role he had chosen for his country.It\'s one thing to say sorry to Putin and patch up relations with Netanyahu; but when you can no longer trust your army, there are more serious matters to concentrate upon.""Even if this coup may have failed, Fisk expected another to follow in the months or years to come.\n\nTurkish professor Akın Ünver described the coup d\'état attempt as ""more of a mutiny"".\n\nThe name of the ""Peace at Home Council"" – Yurtta Sulh Konseyi – is derived from Atatürk\'s famous saying \'Peace at Home, Peace in the World\'.Journalist Ezgi Başaran said that ""the statement of the junta, that was [...] read on the [...] government TV [channel] as the coup got under way, bore a strong resemblance to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk\'s famous address to the Turkish Youth.[...] On the other hand, given that these references are too obvious, they may have been intentionally included to insinuate a Kemalist junta rather than a Gülenist one.""\n\nThe citizen journalism site Bellingcat published an analysis of the messages of a WhatsApp group consisting of high-ranking military officials who had taken part in the coup covering their activities including them killing several people.The messages were cross referenced with video footage.The group was named ""Yurtta sulh"" which refers to a peace at home speech and they seem secular and military with no references to Gülen or anything related during the several hours of messaging.\n\nNews reports have suggested that the coup ringleader was Adil Öksüz.Some believe Öksüz to have been an operative with Turkish intelligence.\n\nGerman Islamic studies scholar said the putschists tried to forestall a large-scale purge of judiciary and military, the implementation of which had already started on Saturday, the day after the coup attempt.According to Turkish investigative journalist Ahmet Şık, a list of officials to be purged had been ready compiled by the attorney-general of Izmir, Okan Bato, and was approved by President Erdoğan.According to this version, the putschists had to quickly bring forward their coup attempt before being disposed and arrested.\n\nDuring and after the events, several politicians and commentators suggested that the government knew about the coup in advance and possibly directed it.The facts that the coup attempt began in the evening rather than at a more inconspicuous time and that the events were largely confined to Ankara and Istanbul contributed to doubts about the authenticity of the coup attempt.Journalists and opposition politicians branded it a \'tragic comedy\' and \'theatre play\'.Advocates of such theories pointed to how Erdoğan stood to gain from the coup attempt in terms of increasing his popularity and support for his calls for an executive presidency, while being able to legitimize further crackdowns on judicial independence and the opposition in general.\n\nOther elements that were reported to support the theory included: no list of demands by the coup plotters, the organization and response of the police, the long lists of arrests that seemed to be ready surprisingly quickly (including arrests of 2,745 judges and 2,839 soldiers), and the obvious nature of the coup actions.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom Erdoğan had said as being one of the principal conspirators, commented, ""I don\'t believe that the world believes the accusations made by President Erdoğan.There is a possibility that it could be a staged coup and it could be meant for further accusations [against the Gülenists].""Journalist Cengiz Çandar, a veteran observer of Turkey\'s coups, said ""I have never seen any with this magnitude of such inexplicable sloppiness.""Prominent Hizmet (Gülen movement) spokesman Alp Aslandogan said, referencing that the Turkish Air Force commander met with Erdoğan before 15 July, that certain legal documentation related to the coup seemed written beforehand, arguing that within ""the indictment written by a prosecutor on the night of 15 July to 16 July, there were events there that didn\'t actually happen.Some events did happen, but those events didn\'t happen by the time the document started.It looks like a bigger plan was there, and part of the plan did not come to pass.""\n\nThe organization and spontaneous synchronization by large numbers of mosques was perceived to be unachievable unless there had been prior preparation, with journalists also pointing to how Erdoğan could have strategically used the call to prayer to invoke religious sentiment in a political situation as a veiled attack on state secularism.\n\nThousands of arrests and purges were conducted by Turkish authorities between 16 and 18 July 2016.The sheer number of these arrests made at such a speed could only be done so if the ""Turkish government had all those lists ready"", as suggested by Johannes Hahn, European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, on 18 July 2016.Hahn also said that because these lists were already available immediately after the coup, the ""event was prepared"" and the lists were to be used ""at a certain stage"".\n\nMehmet Dişli, who was seen giving orders to the coup plotters and who was the one who put a belt around Hulusi Akar\'s neck to make him sign, is the brother of Şaban Dişli, a former vice president of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and confidant of Erdoğan.\n\nSeveral social media users have compared the coup attempt to the Reichstag fire in 1933, which Adolf Hitler used as an excuse to suspend civil liberties and order mass arrests of his opponents.Politico correspondent Ryan Heath said that ""the coup was staged to allow Erdoğan to purge the military of opponents and increase his grip on the country"".Heath used Twitter to share comments from his Turkish source, who called the events of Friday night a ""fake coup"" which would help a ""fake democracy warrior"" (referring to Erdoğan).The source said: ""Probably we\'ll see an early election [in] which he\'ll try to guarantee an unbelievable majority of the votes.And this will probably guarantee another 10–15 years of authoritarian, elected dictatorship.""\n\nThe New York Times reported that some Turkish citizens believed the coup attempt was staged by Erdoğan to improve his public image and popularity, while cracking down on political opponents and expanding his power.Critics found it suspect that reportedly no government officials were arrested or harmed during the attempted coup, which—among other factors—raised the suspicion of a false flag event staged by the Turkish government to crack down on opposition parties.Those in Turkey suggesting that the coup was staged are also being questioned by the government.\n\nPoliticians and journalists who were skeptical of the authenticity of the coup plot said that in reality, a \'civil coup\' had effectively been staged against the Armed Forces and Judiciary, both of which were extensively purged of stated Gülen supporters by the government shortly after the events.Skeptics said that the coup would be used as an excuse for further erosion of judicial independence and a crackdown on the opposition, giving the AKP greater and unstoppable power over all state institutions and paving the way for a more radical Islamist agenda at odds with the founding principles of the Turkish Republic.\n\nJustice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said in late July 2016 that Turkish social media users who said the government was staging the coup faced investigation: ""Just look at the people who are saying on social media that this was theatre.Public prosecutors are already investigating them.Most of them are losers who think it is an honor to die for Fethullah Gülen\'s command.""\n\nOn 12 July 2017, Stockholm Center for Freedom, a monitoring group with reported links to the Gülen movement, published a controversial report stating that President Erdogan orchestrated the coup bid as a false flag to consolidate his powers, set up his opposition for a mass persecution, and push Turkish Armed Forces into a military incursion into Syria.According to the report, it uncovered new evidence from 11 July 2016, four days before the planned coup bid, that a secret plan was circulated among select group of Armed Forces to give an appearance of a coup attempt.The plan was sanctioned by intelligence and military chiefs with the approval of Erdogan.\n\nIn early November 2017, Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for , former Director of the Middle East Program of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, stating that he is an agent of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), that he was present in Istanbul during the 2016 Turkish coup attempt, and that he was one of the key organizers behind the coup attempt.Around 1 December, the Istanbul prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for Graham E. Fuller, an American author and political analyst specializing in Islamic extremism after a long CIA career and holding the role of vice-chair of the United States National Intelligence Council.The prosecutor\'s office based the warrant on suspicion of Fuller helping to plan the coup attempt.Hürriyet stated that Turkish authorities believed that they had traced Fuller\'s location before the attempted coup and afterward when he left Turkey.\n\nBarkey denied his reported role in the coup, describing the claims as ""so ludicrous that they do not even deserve the term \'science fiction\'.""\n\nDeep state in Turkey The Imam\'s Army List of coups and coup attempts since 2010 List of modern conflicts in the Middle East List of attacks on legislatures\n', 'Claim_Context': 'In March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.

119,"{'Wiki_Title': '2016 Turkish coup attempt', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'On 15 July 2016, a faction within the Turkish Armed Forces, organized as the Peace at Home Council, attempted a coup d\'état against state institutions, including the government and president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.They attempted to seize control of several places in Ankara, Istanbul, Marmaris and elsewhere, such as the Asian side entrance of the Bosphorus Bridge, but failed to do so after forces and civilians loyal to the state defeated them.The Council cited an erosion of secularism, elimination of democratic rule, disregard for human rights, and Turkey\'s loss of credibility in the international arena as reasons for the coup.The government said it had evidence the coup leaders were linked to the Gülen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the Republic of Turkey and led by Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish businessman and a well-known Islamic scholar who lives in exile in Pennsylvania.The Turkish government alleged that Gülen was behind the coup (which Gülen denied) and that the United States was harboring him.Events surrounding the coup attempt and the purges in its aftermath reflect a complex power struggle between Islamist elites in Turkey.\n\nDuring the coup attempt, over 300 people were killed and more than 2,100 were injured.Many government buildings, including the Turkish Parliament and the Presidential Palace, were bombed from the air.Mass arrests followed, with at least 40,000 detained, including at least 10,000 soldiers and 2,745 judges, for being affiliated with the coup attempt.15,000 education staff were also suspended and the licenses of 21,000 teachers working at private institutions were revoked after the government stated they were loyal to Gülen.More than 77,000 people have been arrested and over 160,000 fired from their jobs, on reports of connections to Gülen.\n\nThere were many reactions against the coup attempt, both domestically and internationally.The main opposition parties in Turkey condemned the attempt, while several international leaders—such as those of the United States, NATO, the European Union, and neighboring countries—called for ""respect of the democratic institutions in Turkey and its elected officials.""Many international organizations also opposed the coup.The United Nations Security Council, however, did not denounce the coup after disagreements over the phrasing of a statement.Iran opposed the coup and advised Erdogan to defeat the coup plotters.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the head of United States Central Command, General Joseph Votel, was ""siding with coup plotters"", after Votel criticized the Turkish government for arresting the Pentagon\'s contacts in Turkey.\n\nIn March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.The same month, the British Parliament\'s Foreign Affairs Select Committee said some Gulenists were involved in the coup d\'état attempt but found no hard evidence that Fethullah Gülen masterminded the failed coup and found no evidence to justify the United Kingdom designating the Gülen movement as a ""terrorist organization"".\n\nSince the 1970s, followers of the influential cleric Fethullah Gülen had assumed increasingly important positions within the Turkish state apparatus.Gülen several times advised his followers to take key positions in society and government, if necessary with a secret identity to avoid opposition from the laicistic Turkish army and government.Nevertheless, at the start of the 21st century, Gülen\'s followers achieved crucial positions of power in Turkey (and beyond) with a vast network of newspapers, TV channels, schools, associations, lobby organizations, financial institutions and positions within the state such as the army and the judiciary.Initially, the then Prime Minister Erdogan seemingly tolerated the power of the Gülen movement because of common interests such as limiting the undemocratic political power of the military, but also because of impotence and fear of Gülen\'s power within Turkey.\n\nA series of events eventually led to a rift between Erdogan and Gülen.For example, prosecutors that allegedly were aligned with the Gülen movement tried to arrest the intelligence chief Hakan Fidan for the peace negotiations with the PKK, and by extension PM Erdogan subsequently, as the Turkish secret service is directly subordinate to the prime minister of Turkey.During this period (2010-2013), state secrets were leaked, fraud was committed with the entrance exams for government employees (KPSS), a change of power occurred at the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) and (sex)tapes of both government members and opposition members were leaked.Following these events and other incidents, the Turkish government decided to designate the Gülen movement as parallel state and FETÖ (Fethullahist Terror Organization).Alleged Gülen supporters were fired or arrested.The coup attempt that followed is therefore also described by some analysts as a last desperate attempt by Gülenists to retain power.\n\nIt is widely reported that Kemalist ideology played a huge role in motivating the 15 July 2016 coup attempt, like all previous political interventions in the history of Turkey\'s military coups.Since the establishment of multiparty democracy in Turkey in 1946, the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), together with the judiciary, have viewed themselves as guardians of Kemalist ideals and the secular Turkish nationalist state established under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk against political parties that have promoted a larger role for Islam and minorities in public life.The military and judiciary have regularly intervened in politics to block or ban popular parties representing conservative Muslim Turks, attempting to relax the restrictions on traditional religious practices, such as women\'s wearing of headscarves.The military has toppled four elected governments: by coups in 1960 and 1980, and by military decisions in 1971 and 1997.The military has also banned several major political parties.In 1998, Erdoğan, then-mayor of Istanbul, was banned for life from politics and jailed because he had read a religious poem by Ziya Gökalp several years before, at a public meeting.In 2007, the military expressed its opposition to the election of Abdullah Gül, of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), as president, by issuing an e-memorandum.Still, Gül was eventually elected when the AKP won both a referendum on the matter.Also, a snap election, and the party returned with a larger majority in the parliament.The military cited erosion of secularism as one of the reasons for the coup in the statement published on the day of the coup.\n\nAs opposed to previous political interventions by the Turkish military, Turkey\'s AKP government and pro-state media maintain that the 15 July 2016 coup attempt was not motivated by allegiance to Kemalist ideology, but rather to the vast political, economic, and religious network led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen.Between 2007 and 2012, high-profile Kemalists, including high-ranking officers of the Turkish Armed Forces, faced a series of trials and purges, under reports of involvement in a secret society codenamed ""Ergenekon.""Supported by Islamist (both pro-Gülen and pro-Erdoğan) prosecutors, security officials, and media, the purges allowed lower-rank Islamist officers to assume high-ranking military positions.They were seen as a bid by Turkey\'s civilian leaders under President Erdoğan to establish dominance over the military.In these trials in 2013 – viewed as ""sensational"" and ""one of the biggest in recent Turkish history"" – 275 people, including senior military officers, journalists, lawyers, and academics, were said to be involved in the so-called ""Ergenekon"" conspiracy, reportedly plotting a coup in 2003/04 against then–Prime Minister Erdoğan.Additionally, some military officers were said to be involved in a separate reported plot, Sledgehammer.Simultaneously, Erdoğan promoted lower-ranking officers up the chain of command, ensuring that the military chief of staff was loyal to him and thereby demoralizing the army.\n\nThe AKP\'s alliance with Gülen started to collapse during 2013 as Gülenists targeted the AKP using corruption charges.After the split, Erdoğan decided it would be advantageous to rehabilitate the army.The ""Ergenekon"" convictions were overturned in April 2016 by the Court of Cassation, which ruled that the existence of the network was unproven.\n\nIn 2013, law enforcement efforts to fight corruption, which had led to the 2013 corruption scandal in Turkey, were faulted by Erdoğan.The anti-corruption efforts were a source of tension between the Gülenists and the AKP.In political analysis in the months prior to the coup attempt, the incidence of corruption was reported to be ""rife"" in Turkey.Following the coup attempt, some coup leaders cited corruption as a reason for their actions.\n\nOn 13 July, less than two days before the coup was launched, Erdoğan signed a bill giving Turkish soldiers immunity from prosecution while taking part in domestic operations.The bill requires cases against commanders to be approved by the prime minister, while district governors may sign cases against lower-ranking soldiers.The immunity bill was seen as part of the détente between the government and the armed forces.The latter has increasingly been taking over military operations in Kurdish-inhabited areas from police and paramilitary units.\n\nOn 15 July 2016, as reported just before 23:00 EEST (UTC+3), military jets were spotted flying over Ankara, and both the Fatih Sultan Mehmet and Bosphorus bridges in Istanbul were closed.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said military action was being ""taken outside the chain of command"" and it was an ""illegal attempt"" to seize power by ""part of the military"".He further said that those involved ""will pay the highest price.""Local media also reported tanks in Istanbul\'s Atatürk Airport.It was reported that Internet users within Turkey were blocked from accessing Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.Twitter later stated that it had ""no reason to think we\'ve been fully blocked"".Some hostages were taken at military headquarters, including the Turkish Chief of the General Staff Hulusi Akar.At around 21:00, the coupists had invited Salih Zeki Çolak, the commander of the Turkish Land Forces to the military headquarters.When he arrived, he was immediately apprehended.Abidin Ünal, head of the Turkish Air Force, who had been attending a wedding in Istanbul, was abducted from there by soldiers who descended from a helicopter.The coupists then tried to force Akar to sign the coup declaration, almost strangling him using a belt in the process.He refused and was then taken to the Akıncı Air Base and other commanders at the headquarters.The military also entered the Justice and Development Party\'s offices in Istanbul and asked people to leave.\n\nEarly reports said President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was safe in Marmaris, south-west Turkey, where he had been on holiday.\n\nFrom around 23:00 to midnight, helicopters bombed the police special forces headquarters and police air force headquarters in Gölbaşı, just outside of Ankara.The attacks left 42 dead and 43 injured.Türksat headquarters in Gölbaşı was also attacked, killing two security personnel.\n\nAt around 23:50, soldiers occupied Taksim Square in central Istanbul.\n\nAt 00:02, it was reported by Reuters that soldiers were inside the buildings of the state broadcaster, the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), in Ankara.During the coup attempt, soldiers forced anchor Tijen Karaş to read out a statement saying that ""the democratic and secular rule of law has been eroded by the current government"" and that Turkey was now led by the Peace at Home Council who would ""ensure the safety of the population.""The statement read in part: ""Turkish Armed Forces have completely taken over the administration of the country to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedoms, the rule of law and general security that was damaged.[...] All international agreements are still valid.We hope that all of our good relationships with all countries will continue.""The plotters said they had ""done so to preserve democratic order, and that the rule of law must remain a priority"".The statement also ordered temporary martial law (sıkıyönetim), and said a new constitution would be prepared ""as soon as possible"".TRT was then taken off air.\n\nOther media outlets were also raided by the putschists, such as Turkish newspaper Hürriyet and private broadcaster CNN Türk.\n\nReuters reported on 15 July that an EU source described the coup as ""well orchestrated,"" and predicted that ""given the scale of the operation, it is difficult to imagine they will stop short of prevailing.""Another EU diplomat said that the Turkish ambassador in his capital was shocked and ""taking it very seriously"".\n\nThe Peace at Home Council was reportedly chaired by Muharrem Köse.\n\nAdana: Upon receiving the intelligence that thirty soldiers from the 10th Air Base Command would move to the base where the regional and provincial gendarmerie commands were located, the police prevented the soldiers from leaving the guardhouse with TOMA and armored vehicles and blocked them.Bitlis: In the Tatvan district of Bitlis, on the orders of Brigade Commander Arif Seddar Afşar, helicopters were circulated in the skies of Tatvan and fired at the city.The brigade command left the municipality\'s construction equipment in front of the barracks in case there was a tank operation in the district.Denizli: Approximately five hundred officers and non-commissioned officers who participated in the coup attempt surrendered to the gendarmerie and police forces.They were interrogated at Çardak District Gendarme Command.Kars: With the order of Kars 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, the soldiers who came with tanks and armored personnel carriers surrounded the Police Headquarters building and wanted to detain Faruk Karaduman, the chief of police.At the same hours, the invitation of Deputy Governors, 14th Mechanized Brigade Commander Brigadier General Ali Avcı, went to the command.Kocaeli: Turkcell\'s data center in Gebze was raided by soldiers who participated in the coup attempt.Soldiers who tried to interrupt the internet service were detained.Malatya: A rebellious soldier opened fire inside a base of the Turkish 2nd Army, damaging six vehicles.The base was besieged by police and loyal soldiers, and the shooter was captured.Marmaris: Three military helicopters carried out a bomb attack on the hotel where Erdoğan was staying.Forty rebellious soldiers of the Special Forces Command clashed with the police in the region.Mersin: Mersin Garrison and Mediterranean Region Commander Admiral Nejat Atilla Demirhan called Mersin Provincial Police Deputy Chief Yakup Usta and Gendarmerie Colonel Mustafa Bakçepınar and stated that the Turkish Armed Forces had taken over the administration.He introduced himself as the martial law garrison commander and ordered Mersin Governor Özdemir Çakacak and district governors to be taken into custody.Demirhan and Dağdelen, who made the same announcement with the police radio obtained from Mersin Police Department, were detained through the operation of the security forces.Sakarya: Sakarya Governorship was captured with armored personnel carriers, military trucks and many military jeeps from the military unit in the Kandıra district of Kocaeli.As a reinforcement, two military vehicles full of soldiers from the Sakarya central division command had to return to their barracks in the face of the resistance of the police and the harsh reaction of the people who took to the streets against the putschists.The vehicles occupying the Sakarya Governorate were seized by the citizens and the soldiers in them were neutralized and handed over to the security forces.Afterwards, citizens and security forces entered the governor\'s office and neutralized the soldiers there and suppressed the uprising in the province.Eight civilian citizens were injured as a result of the fire opened by the military during the incident.Şırnak: Çakırsöğüt Gendarmerie Commando Brigadier General Ali Osman Gürcan and 309 soldiers, that participated in the coup attempt, were detained by the security forces.\n\nTurkey\'s Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım responded to the events by stating that an ""illegal action is taking place outside of the chain of command"".He also said that ""the government elected by the people remains in charge and this government will only go when the people say so.""The Turkish Presidential office said President Erdoğan was on holiday inside Turkey and condemned the coup attempt as an attack on democracy.A presidential source also said Erdoğan and his government were still in power.The first messages from Erdoğan were transmitted at around 00:23At about 01:00, Erdoğan did a FaceTime interview with CNN Türk, in which he called upon his supporters to take to the streets in defiance of the military-imposed curfew, saying ""There is no power higher than the power of the people.Let them do what they will at the public squares and airports.""Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş appeared on live television, saying Turkey\'s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is still in charge of the government.The mayor of Ankara, Melih Gökçek of the AKP, encouraged people to go out to the city\'s streets in defiance, despite a curfew imposed by the military.Erdoğan\'s plane took off from Dalaman Airport near Marmaris at 23:47, but had to wait in the air south of Atatürk for the airport to be secured.His plane landed at 02:50\n\nThe First Army General Command in Istanbul stated in a news conference that the TSK did not support the coup and the perpetrators represented a tiny faction that were on the verge of being brought under control.Istanbul Atatürk Airport was closed; all flights from the airport were cancelled.There was an explosion in the TRT broadcasting headquarters and gunfire was reported in Ankara.Soon after, it was stormed by a crowd of civilians and police, with four soldiers inside reportedly being ""neutralized"".The channel went back on air and Karaş, who had previously announced the coup, said live that she had been held hostage and forced to read the declaration of the coup at gunpoint.\n\nBy 01:00, it was reported that the military had pulled its forces from the Atatürk airport and people were coming inside, but by 01:13, it was reported that tanks were inside the airport and gunfire was heard.\n\nTanks opened fire near the Turkish Parliament Building.The parliamentary building was also hit from the air.Injuries were reported among protesters following gunfire on Bosphorus Bridge.\n\nA helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was shot down by a Turkish military F-16 fighter jet.There were also reports of pro-state jets flying over Ankara to ""neutralize"" helicopters used by those behind the coup.\n\nAt 03:08, a military helicopter opened fire on the Turkish parliament.At 03:10, Turkish Armed Forces stated on their website that they had complete control over the country.At 03:12, Yıldırım made a statement saying that the situation was under control and that a no-fly zone was declared over Ankara and that military planes that still flew would be shot down.\n\nIt was reported that the Turkish parliament had been bombed again at 03:23 and 03:33.A helicopter belonging to the pro-coup forces was also seen flying by it.Half an hour following the report of 12 deaths and 2 injuries in the parliament, soldiers entered CNN Türk\'s headquarters and forced the studio to go off air.After an hour of interruption by the pro-coup soldiers, CNN Türk resumed its broadcast.Later, İsmail Kahraman said a bomb exploded at a corner of the public relations building inside the parliament, with no deaths but several injuries among police officers.\n\nAt around 04:00 two or three helicopters attacked Erdogan\'s hotel.According to eyewitness accounts, ten to fifteen heavily armed men landed and started firing.In the ensuing conflict, two policemen were killed and 8 were injured.\n\nThe Doğan News Agency reported that in Istanbul several individuals were injured after soldiers fired on a group of people attempting to cross the Bosphorus Bridge in protest of the attempted coup.\n\nOn Saturday 16 July 2016, at 00:42 EEST (UTC+3), a Turkish Black Hawk helicopter sent a distress signal and requested permission from Greek authorities for an emergency landing, and landed eight minutes later (00:50) at the Dimokritos airport in Alexandroupoli, in Greece, while two Greek F-16s observed the procedure and escorted it to the airport.The first reports said that the passengers were seven military personnel and a civilian.Later, it turned out that all were military personnel (two majors, four captains and two non-commissioned officers).They had removed the badges and insignia from their uniforms, making it impossible to know their rank.All were arrested after landing for illegal entry into the country.They were transferred to the local police station, while the Greek authorities at the airport guarded the helicopter.The eight passengers all requested political asylum in Greece as they believed they would not get a fair trial in Turkey.On 21 September 2016, Greece denied three out of the eight asylum.The men\'s lawyer Stavroula Tomara said they would be appealing the decision and said they had the ""impression that the decision has been predetermined, and that the interview was conducted just as a formality.""On 11 October 2016, four more of the eight were denied asylum.Two of the men who had previously been denied asylum applied for a re-evaluation but their applications were also rejected.\n\nAfter Erdoğan flew into Istanbul, he made a televised speech inside the airport at around 04:00, whilst thousands gathered outside.He addressed a crowd of supporters in the airport, at about 06:30 He said, ""In Turkey, armed forces are not governing the state or leading the state.They cannot.""He blamed ""those in Pennsylvania"" (a reference to Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, and his Hizmet Movement) for the coup attempt.Erdoğan also said he had plans to ""clean up"" the army, saying that ""This uprising is a gift from God to us.""State-run Anadolu Agency named former Colonel Muharrem Köse, who in March 2016 was dishonorably discharged for reported association with Gülen, as the suspected leader of the coup.However, the Alliance for Shared Values, a non-profit organization associated with Gülen, released a statement reiterating that it condemns any military intervention in domestic politics, and saying Erdoğan\'s allegations against the movement were ""highly irresponsible"".Gülen himself said in a brief statement just before midnight: ""As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nReuters reported that in early hours of 16 July, the coup appeared to have ""crumbled"" as crowds defied pro-coup military orders and gathered in major squares of Istanbul and Ankara to oppose it.Reuters also reported pro-coup soldiers surrendering to the police in Taksim Square, Istanbul.It was reported that by 05:18, Atatürk airport had completely been recaptured by the government whilst the police had surrounded the coupists inside the Turkish army headquarters, calling for them to surrender.Between 06:00–08:00 a skirmish took place there.In Akar\'s absence, Ümit Dündar, head of the First Army, was appointed Acting Chief of Staff.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning of 16 July, soldiers blocking the Bosphorus Bridge surrendered to the police.According to the government-run Anadolu Agency, this consisted of a group of 50 soldiers.Some of these soldiers were lynched by civilians despite the police\'s efforts, who fired into the air to protect the surrendering soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile, in the headquarters of the Turkish Army, 700 unarmed soldiers surrendered as the police conducted an operation into the building while 150 armed soldiers were kept inside by the police.The coupists in the TRT building in Istanbul surrendered in the early morning as well.Chief of Staff Akar, held hostage at the Akıncı Air Base in Ankara, was also rescued by pro-state forces.\n\nOne of the primary reasons that the coup failed was chaos among the plotters\' ranks.Turkey\'s National Intelligence Organization (MİT) head Hakan Fidan discovered the coup plot, and the plotters were forced to execute the coup five hours ahead of schedule.One of the main organizers, General Semih Terzi, was shot dead by loyalist Sgt.Maj.Ömer Halisdemir at the onset, demoralizing and disrupting command and control of the rebels.These two incidents resulted in the coup being carried out in an uncoordinated manner.The highest ranking staff officers opposed the coup, and publicly ordered all personnel to return to their barracks.Acting outside the military chain of command, the rebels lacked the coordination and resources to achieve their goals.The conscripted soldiers that the rebels mobilized were uninformed of their mission\'s true purpose and became demoralized.Many surrendered rather than shoot demonstrators.The commander of the First Army in Istanbul, General Ümit Dündar, personally called Erdoğan to warn him of the plot, persuading him to evacuate his hotel ahead of the plotters, and helped to secure Istanbul for Erdoğan to land.The MİT also mobilized its anti-aircraft guns, which the plotters were unaware existed, deterring rebel jets and commando teams.\n\nEqually important to the coup\'s failure, according to military strategist Edward N. Luttwak, was the inability of the rebels to neutralize Erdoğan and other high ranking government officials, either by killing or detaining them.A unit of special forces was sent via helicopter to kill or capture the president, but missed because he had been evacuated by his security detail just minutes before.Once Erdoğan landed at Atatürk International Airport (which had been recaptured from the rebels by his supporters), It became highly unlikely that the coup attempt would succeed.According to a military source, several rebel F-16s targeted Erdoğan\'s presidential jet en route to Istanbul, but they did not fire.A senior Turkish counter-terrorism official later stated that the jets did not fire because the fighter jet pilots were told by President Erdoğan\'s pilot over the radio that the (flight of the) Gulfstream IV was a Turkish Airlines flight.\n\nAccording to Naunihal Singh, author of Seizing Power, the coup attempt also failed because the plotters failed to secure control of the media and shape the narrative.Successful coups require that the rebels control the mass media.This allows even small rebel contingents to portray themselves as fully in control, and their victory as inevitable.Consequently, they convince the public, along with neutral and even loyalist soldiers, to defect to them or not resist.The rebels failed to properly broadcast their messages effectively across the media that they controlled.They failed to capture Türksat, Turkey\'s main cable and satellite communications company, and failed to gain control of the country\'s television and mobile phone networks.This allowed Erdoğan to make his Facetime call, and to speak on television.\n\nOther scholars of civil-military relations, like Drew H. Kinney, have said reports like Luttwak and Singh\'s miss the point of their own analysis: civil resistance thwarted the coup.Luttwak argues that wayward elements of the Turkish armed forces could not silence Erdoğan.Singh says that the rebels could not project success because they couldn\'t control the message.Kinney states that neither of these reasons on their own matter, but rather it\'s their effect—civil disobedience—that is important.We might find that ""[Gülen\'s movement] ...[might] have had nothing to do with the attempted takeover in July, but civilians [nevertheless] definitely played a role in thwarting the coup,"" writes Kinney.""...[A]n unhappy civilian populace mobilized to face down the military.""\n\nErdoğan wasn\'t censored (Luttwak\'s point) and was therefore able to use FaceTime to mobilize resistance, which in turn hindered the conspirators\' ability to project success (Singh\'s point).The result is civilian resistance to soldiers, i.e., people power.The reason Singh, Luttwak, and other scholars of civil-military relations miss this is, according to Kinney, because they ""usually do not study extra-military reasons for coup failures/successes,"" but rather put a premium on ""the inner-workings of the [military] operation.""In short, they blame the military for its failure rather than acknowledge the power of the masses and their successes.\n\nPro-state forces sent text messages to every Turkish citizen calling for them to protest against the coup attempt.Throughout the night sela prayers were repeatedly called from mosque minarets across the country to encourage people to resist the coup plotters.While the sela is usually called from minarets to inform the public of a funeral, they are also traditionally performed to notify of a significant event, in this case ""to rally people"".\n\nThe coup plotters initiated their operation hours ahead of the planned time when they understood that their plans had been compromised.Had the coup been launched at its original time, the middle of the night, much of the population would have been asleep.The streets would have been mostly empty.\n\nReports have emerged, neither confirmed nor denied by Russia or Turkey that the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate intercepted signals on an imminent coup passed on to loyal Turkish operatives.The intercepted plans revealed several helicopters with commandos were on the way to Marmaris\'s coastal resort, where Erdoğan stayed, capturing or killing him.Pre-warned, Erdoğan left quickly to avoid them.\n\nAn extensive purge of the Turkish civil service began in the wake of the coup attempt, with President Erdoğan warning his opponents that ""they will pay a heavy price for this.""The New York Times along with some other Western media such as The Economist, described the purges as a ""counter-coup"", with the Times expecting the president to ""become more vengeful and obsessed with control than ever, exploiting the crisis not just to punish mutinous soldiers but to further quash whatever dissent is left in Turkey,"".As of 20 July 2016, the purge already had seen over 45,000 military officials, police officers, judges, governors and civil servants arrested or suspended, including 2,700 judges, 15,000 teachers, and every university dean in the country.\n\n163 generals and admirals were detained, around 45% of the Turkish military\'s total.\n\nOn 18 July 2016, United States State Secretary John Kerry urged Turkish authorities to halt the increasing crackdown on its citizens, indicating that the crackdown was meant to ""suppress dissent.""French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault voiced concern, warning against a ""political system which turns away from democracy"" in response to the purges.\n\nOn 17 August 2016, Turkey started releasing what was expected to eventually amount to about 38,000 prison inmates, to make more space in the penal system for detainees, numbering about 35,000, who were arrested or detained after being involved in or suspected of association, with the 2016 failed coup.\n\nOn 28 September 2016, Turkish justice minister Bekir Bozdağ said 70,000 people had been processed and 32,000 were formally arrested.\n\nMajor General Cahit Bakir, who commanded Turkish forces under NATO in Afghanistan, and Brigadier General Sener Topuc, responsible for education and aid in Afghanistan, were detained by authorities in Dubai connected with the failed coup.\n\nGeneral Akın Öztürk, former Commander of the Turkish Air Force, was the Turkish military attaché to Israel.He was arrested on charges of having played a leading role in the failed coup.Öztürk has denied the charges.\n\nGeneral Adem Huduti, the commander of the Second Army, positioned along the southern borders with Syria and Iraq, and General Erdal Öztürk, the commander of the 3rd Corps, were also arrested.\n\nRear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been stationed at NATO\'s Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk, Virginia, sought asylum in the United States after being recalled by the Turkish government.\n\nIn July 2018, Istanbul\'s 25th Criminal Court sentenced 72 former soldiers involved in the coup attempt to life in prison.\n\nOn 20 June 2019, a terrorism court in Turkey sentenced 151 people to life in prison, including General Akın Öztürk, former commander of Turkish Air Force and the most senior officer involved in the coup.128 people received ""aggravated life"" sentences, which indicates harsh conditions without parole, for their role in the coup, with another 23 receiving standard life sentences.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom President Erdoğan said as one of the principal conspirators, condemned the coup attempt and denied any role in it.""I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey,"" he said in an emailed statement reported by The New York Times.""Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force.I pray to God for Turkey, Turkish citizens, and all those currently in Turkey that this situation is resolved peacefully and quickly.As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt.I categorically deny such accusations.""\n\nPresident Erdoğan asked the United States to extradite Gülen: ""I call on you again, after there was a coup attempt.Extradite this man in Pennsylvania to Turkey!If we are strategic partners or model partners, do what is necessary.""Prime Minister Yildirim has threatened war against any country that would support Gülen.Turkish Labor Minister Süleyman Soylu said that ""America is behind the coup.""\n\nRegarding the AKP\'s statement against Gülen, Secretary of State Kerry invited the Turkish government ""to present us with any legitimate evidence that withstands scrutiny,"" before they would accept an extradition request.\n\nOn 15 August 2016, former United States diplomat James Jeffrey, who was the United States ambassador to Turkey from 2008 until 2010 made the following remarks: ""The Gülen movement has some infiltration at the least in the military that I am aware of.They of course had extreme infiltration into the police and judiciary earlier.I saw that when I was in Turkey previously, particularly in the Sledgehammer case, Hakan Fidan case, and the corruption cases in 2013.Obviously, significant segment of Turkey\'s bureaucracy was infiltrated and had their allegiance to a movement.That of course is absolutely unacceptable and extremely dangerous.It likely led to the coup attempt.""\n\nOutside Turkey, in Beringen, Belgium, anti-coup protesters attempted to attack a building owned by the pro-Gülen movement group \'Vuslat\'.The police brought in a water cannon to keep the attackers at bay.In news articles it was stated that the police also protected the houses of Gülen supporters.People advocated on social media to go to Beringen once more, and there was unrest in Heusden-Zolder, elsewhere in Belgium.Furthermore, in Somalia the government ordered ""the total closure of all activities"" of an organization linked to the Gülen movement, and gave its staff seven days to leave the country.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, President Erdoğan said Western countries were ""supporting terrorism"" and the military coup, saying ""I\'m calling on the United States: what kind of strategic partners are we, that you can still host someone whose extradition I have asked for?""\n\nOn 31 January 2017, British Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, Alan Duncan said he believed the Gülen movement was responsible for the coup attempt.Duncan went on saying ""the organization which incorporated itself into the state tried to topple the democratic structure in Turkey"".\n\nIn a speech on 29 July 2016, President Erdoğan said U.S. Central Command chief Joseph Votel was ""siding with coup plotters""; Erdoğan said the United States was protecting Fethullah Gülen, whom the Turkish government blames for the coup attempt.Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim made similar comments.In response, Votel said that the Turkish government\'s statements were ""unfortunate and completely inaccurate"" and expressed concern that the mass arrests and firings of military officers would damage military cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey.Similarly, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said that the Turkish military purges were impairing the fight against ISIS.\n\nOn 2 August 2016, in an escalation of tensions with the United States, Erdoğan questioned Turkey\'s relationship with the United States and criticized the West, saying that ""script"" for the abortive putsch last month was ""written abroad"".Erdoğan stated that he had personally asked Obama to extradite Gülen to Turkey.When the U.S. government replied it would need evidence of the cleric\'s guilt before extradition, to which Erdoğan said: ""When you asked for the return of a terrorist, we did not ask for documentation. ...Let us put him on trial.""\n\nYeni Şafak daily, a Turkish pro-state newspaper, stated that the former commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, now-retired United States Army General John F. Campbell, was the ""mastermind"" behind the coup attempt in Turkey.Campbell called the statement ""absolutely ridiculous"" and President Obama said ""Any reports that we had any previous knowledge of a coup attempt, that there was any U.S. involvement in it, that we were anything other than entirely supportive of Turkish democracy are completely false, unequivocally false.""\n\nOn 1 December 2017, Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for American political analyst, former CIA official and former vice chairman of US National Intelligence Council Graham Fuller, stating his involvement in the coup.A career US State Department official who was once CIA Station Chief in Kabul and later went on to be a political scientist in Rand Corporation specializing in the Middle East, Turkish authorities said Fuller attended a meeting in Istanbul on 15 July 2016 involving organization and coordination of the botched coup.Another American among the attendance, as stated by the Turkish prosecutors, was academic Henri Barkey who was named a suspect a week after the failed coup.\n\nThe U.S. consulate in Turkey issued an advisory to U.S. citizens to avoid the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey, which houses about 50 nuclear bombs, until ""normal operations have been restored"".They stated that local authorities were denying access to the air base and that power supplying the air base was shut off.\n\nThe Incirlik base is important to the U.S.-led effort in Syria to combat ISIL and other militants.Nearly 1,500 American personnel are housed in the base.\n\nTwenty-four hours after initial reports that the air base was shut down, United States defense department officials confirmed that the base and its airspace had re-opened to military aircraft and that operations by American aircraft will resume.The Turkish commander of the air base, brig.Gen. Bekir Ercan Van was arrested.After the failure of the coup Gen Bekir Ercan Van sought asylum from the U.S., but his request was denied by U.S.\n\nFollowing the failed coup attempt multiple media outlets have published editorials advocating the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Incirlik Air base as Turkey is unstable.\n\nOn 16 July, anti-coup protesters chanted against locals in areas of Istanbul with high concentration of Alevis, including Okmeydanı and Gazi.Such incidents also occurred in a quarter of Antakya with a high Alevi population, where a motorcyclist stating to be a sharia advocate was lynched.In a neighbourhood of Ankara, shops belonging to Syrians were attacked by a mob.In Malatya, Sunni Islamists harassed residents of an Alevi neighbourhood, particularly the women, and attempted to enter the neighbourhood en masse.Police intervened and blocked all roads leading there.In Kadıköy, people drinking alcohol in public were attacked by a group of religious fundamentalists.\n\nFollowing the arrests, thousands of anti-coup protesters demanded instituting the death penalty against detainees connected with the coup, chanting ""we want the death penalty"".President Erdoğan has been open to reinstituting the death penalty, noting that ""in a democracy, whatever the people want they will get.""Turkish authorities have not executed anyone since 1984, but legally abolished capital punishment only in 2004 as a pre-condition to join the European Union.\n\nEuropean Union officials have been vocal about their opposition to purges by Turkish authorities in connection to the coup.French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said that Turkey must work within the framework of the law to uphold Europe\'s democratic principles.Furthermore, on 18 July 2016, Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of Foreign Affairs of the European Union, announced that no country will be admitted into the European Union ""if it introduces the death penalty"".Moreover, German press secretary, Steffen Seibert, stated that reinstituting the death penalty will end Turkey\'s accession talks with the European Union.\n\nTurkey is a member of the Council of Europe, and ratified the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) as part of its terms of membership.The ECHR is an international treaty that includes the abolition of the death penalty among its terms.As such, Turkey is legally bound not to reintroduce the death penalty.\n\nOn 20 July 2016, President Erdoğan announced a three-month state of emergency in response to the attempted coup, invoking Article 120 of the Constitution of Turkey (""Declaration of state of emergency because of widespread acts of violence and serious deterioration of public order"").Under the state of emergency, under Article 121, ""the Council of Ministers, meeting under the chairpersonship of the President of the Republic, may issue decrees having the force of law on matters necessitated by the state of emergency"", with decrees subject to subsequent parliamentary approval.The state of emergency was endorsed by the Parliament on 21 July by 346 votes to 115.The Justice and Development Party and the Nationalist Movement Party supported the state of emergency, whilst the Republican People\'s Party and the Peoples\' Democratic Party opposed it.Prime Minister Yıldırım said at the Parliament that the state of emergency was necessary to ""get rid of this scourge rapidly"".\n\nAs part of the state of emergency, deputy prime minister Kurtulmuş announced that Turkey was temporarily suspending part of the European Convention on Human Rights following the attempted coup, invoking Article 15 of the Convention (""war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation"").The suspensions must be notified to the Council of Europe and may not affect the right to a fair trial or the prohibition on torture.\n\nThis state of emergency in Turkey as well as the hindrance of the right to protest that occurred within such framework have been layered onto a longer history of emergency rules, oppressive legislation and daily government practice that have reinforced both.We can see from this the ""autocratisation"" process in Turkey has thrived of existing legal framework deeply associated in legacies of past ""emergencies"".\n\nOn 3 October 2016 Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş declared the governments intention to extend the state of emergency by a further three months raising objections from both the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) and Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) were critical of the governments use of their emergency powers and declared that they would vote against an extension.\n\nFollowing the National Security Council\'s recommendation for the extension President Erdoğan stated that it was possible that the state of emergency could last for longer than a year prompting outcry from the opposition, Leader of the Main Opposition Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu said that ""The president saying that the state of emergency can last longer than 12 months is strengthening the fear of a counter-coup"" and that it was ""raising the prospect of opportunist measures.""\n\nThe AKP\'s governmental majority allowed the three-month extension to take effect on 19 October 2016.The two-year-long state of emergency was ended on 19 July 2018.\n\nOn 16 July 2016, the media reported that eight Turkish military personnel of various ranks had landed in Greece\'s northeastern city of Alexandroupolis on board a Black Hawk helicopter and claimed political asylum in Greece.While the Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu demanded extradition of ""the eight traitors as soon as possible"", the Greek authorities stated: ""We will follow the procedures of international law.However, we give severe considerations to the fact that [the Turkish military men] are accused, in their own country, of violating the constitutional order and trying to overthrow democracy.""The helicopter was returned to Turkey shortly thereafter.The eight asylum seekers, their asylum case pending, were later transferred to Athens, mainly for safety reasons.On 26 January, the Supreme Court of Greece eventually ruled against their extradition, on the grounds that the eight were unlikely to face a fair trial if returned to their home country and due to concerns over their safety.\n\nOn 15 February 2017, five Turkish commandos illegally entered Greece through the Evros river.However, once they entered the country, the group split.The two of them surrendered to the police and on 20 February 2017, requested political asylum.They were being held in the city of Alexandroupolis.The two men belonged to the Turkish navy.The names given by the two reportedly match the names of two fugitives wanted in relation to the shadowy operation against Erdoğan himself.The Greek government mentioned that the Greek authorities will not allow the country to be dragged into the ongoing feud between the Turkish state and the followers of Gulen.But there were no sign of the other three.According to a lawyer there were indications that the other three have been arrested by Greek authorities who were about to expel them to Turkey.According to new evidence and new information these three ""arrested"" marines were delivered under fast and informal procedures from Greek to Turkish services.\n\nAfter the coup attempt, two Turkish military attachés in Athens, Staff Col. İlhan Yaşıtlı and naval attaché Col. Halis Tunç, had reportedly disappeared along with their families.The Greek foreign ministry canceled the two attachés\' accreditations on 7 August 2016, upon the request of the Turkish foreign ministry.Greek media reported that they might have fled to Italy.On 11 August 2016, the Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu confirmed the reports saying that they had left Greece for Italy on 6 August and adding that Turkey would officially ask the Italian authorities to extradite the two soldiers.\n\nOn 9 August 2016, the media reported that Turkey\'s Rear Admiral Mustafa Zeki Ugurlu, who had been on a United States-based assignment for NATO and after the coup was subject to a detention order in Turkey, had sought asylum in the United States.\n\nIn mid-November 2016, it was officially confirmed that about 40 Turkish military servicemen of various ranks stationed at NATO command structures had applied for asylum in Germany and Belgium.\n\nIn January 2017, Der Spiegel magazine and ARD broadcaster reported that about 40 mostly high-ranking Turkish soldiers who worked at NATO facilities in Germany requested asylum in Germany.\n\nAt the end of February 2017, Germany said it had received 136 asylum requests from Turks holding diplomatic passports since the July coup attempt.The figure was a total for August 2016 to January 2017; some were presumed to be military officers posted to NATO bases in Germany.\n\nIn November 2016, NATO\'s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that Turkish NATO Officers had requested asylum in the countries where they had been posted.He did not name the nations involved or the number of officers, saying it was a matter for those countries to decide.He said: ""Some Turkish officers working in NATO command structure ... have requested asylum in the countries where they are working. ...As always, this is an issue that is going to be assessed and decided by the different NATO allies as a national issue.""\n\nAs of March 2017, Norway have granted asylum for four Turkish soldiers and a military attache.\n\nSeveral Turkish citizens with diplomatic passports have sought political asylum in Switzerland.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, detainees in Turkey have been denied access to legal counsel, have been beaten and tortured.They have not been provided with adequate food, water, or medical care.At least one has attempted suicide.Amnesty International wanted the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture to send people to check on detainees conditions.A person who had been on duty at the Ankara police headquarters said that police denied medical treatment to a detainee.""Let him die.We will say he came to us dead,"" the witness quoted a police doctor as saying.\n\nAlso, Erdoğan has extended the maximum period of detention for suspects from four days to 30, a move Amnesty said increased the risk of torture or other maltreatment of detainees.\n\nTurkish Justice Ministry denied the reports and the Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said on his Twitter account: ""There has not been any torture or assault of detainees in custody,"" in response to reports by Amnesty International.""The claims of torture and assault make up a pre-packaged misinformation campaign formed by members of FETÖ, one which is untrue and distorted,""\n\nOn 7 August, between three and five million people gathered for an anti-coup rally organized by the Turkish authorities in Istanbul.President Erdoğan and the two leaders of the major opposition parties (the Republican People\'s Party and the Nationalist Movement Party) were present.\n\nGreek authorities on several Aegean islands have called for emergency measures to curtail a growing flow of refugees from Turkey; the number of migrants and refugees willing to make the journey across the Aegean has increased noticeably after the failed coup.At Athens officials voiced worries because Turkish monitors overseeing the deal in Greece had been abruptly pulled out after the failed coup without being replaced.Also, the mayor of Kos expressed concern in a letter to the Greek Prime Minister citing the growing influx of refugees and migrants after the failed coup.The Association of Greek Tourism Enterprises (SETE) warned about the prospect of another flare-up in the refugee/migrant crisis due to the Turkish political instability.\n\nVincent Cochetel, the director of the Europe Bureau of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said in August 2016 that parts of the EU-Turkey deal about immigration were already de facto suspended because no Turkish police were present at Greek detention centres to oversee deportations.\n\nOn 25 August 2016, seven Turkish citizens sought asylum in Greece.Two were university professors, and their two children applied for asylum in Alexandroupoli after they illegally entered the country from the northeastern border.Also, three businessmen illegally reached the Greek island of Rhodes, and they also applied for asylum.\n\nOn 30 August 2016, a Turkish judge arrived at the Greek island of Chios on a migrant boat, with six Syrian nationals, and sought asylum in the country.He told the Greek coastguard and police officers that he is being persecuted in Turkey for his political beliefs by President Tayyip Erdoğan.The Turkish judge had been arrested for illegally entering the country and was transferred to Athens for his asylum proceedings.The Syrian nationals claimed refugee status.\n\nOn 11 September 2016, four Turkish civilians were arrested by Turkish police.An academic and a teacher attempted to escape to Greece illegally by crossing the Evros river, and the other two because they organized the escape attempt.The academic and the teacher paid a total of 12,500 euros in Istanbul to arrange their escape to Greece.Before their attempt, both the academic and the teacher were suspended from their duties as part of the ongoing probe into the failed coup attempt.Police also seized an air raft, an oar and a pump while detaining the suspects.The court later ordered the two\'s release while the other two suspects, who organized the escape attempt, were arrested.\n\nOn 21 September 2016, ten Turkish civilians, two men, two women and six children landed by boat illegally on the Greek island of Rhodes and sought asylum.They told the Greek authorities they were working in the private sector in Turkey and the Turkish government was persecuting them due to their political beliefs.\n\nOn 29 September 2016, five Turkish nationals, a couple and their child and two other men, arrived in Greece, at Alexandroupolis by crossing the Evros River by boat illegally and requested political asylum.\n\nOn 12 December 2016, one female Turkish national, landed by boat, full of refugees and immigrants, illegally on the Greek island of Lesbos.She requested political asylum.\n\nOn 24 October 2017, Turkish authorities obtained information that 995 Turks have applied for asylum in Greece after the coup attempt.\n\nMore than 1,800 Turkish citizens requested asylum in Greece in 2017.\n\nOn 18 February 2018, seventeen Turkish nationals, including six children, requested asylum in Greece at Oinousses island.\n\nIn August 2018, the former lawmaker for the Peoples\' Democratic Party, Leyla Birlik, requested asylum in Greece after illegally crossing the border near Alexandroupolis.\n\nBerlin mayor, Michael Müller (SPD), said Turkey was waging war on supporters of the Gülen movement in Germany.He said that Turkish officials had approached him and asked him whether he would be prepared to confront the Gülen movement in Berlin critically and, if necessary, to support measures against it.The mayor rejected the idea and made it very clear that Turkish conflicts could not be waged in the city.\n\nDer Spiegel presented classified documents, which showed that Turkey\'s secret service (MIT) had asked Germany\'s foreign intelligence agency (BND) for help in rounding up Gülen supporters in Germany.The Turkish secret service wanted the BND to use its influence to spur German lawmakers into taking action against Gülen supporters and extraditing them to Turkey.Also, Turkey\'s government has sent German authorities requests for searches and extraditions linked to supporters of Fethullah Gülen in Germany.\n\nIn Germany businesses thought to be in support of the Gülen movement have been harassed by Erdoğan supporters.\n\nAfter the failed coup, there was a massive demonstration in Cologne at Germany, in late July, in support of Turkish President Erdoğan.Erdoğan wanted to address the participants via video but was rejected by the local authorities and the German Constitutional Court due to security concerns.Turkey said that the ban was unacceptable and a violation of freedom of expression.\n\nGerman authorities said Turkish mosques in Germany were playing Turkish politics and worried that Turkey\'s internal politics spilled over into German cities.For years, German authorities had encouraged Turkey\'s state-run religious institution Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs usually referred to as DİTİB to provide Islamic preachers and teachers and Gülen Movement Schools for the large Turkish diaspora in Germany.DİTİB manages some 900 mosques in Germany.Gülen movement runs 100 educational facilities in Germany.\n\nAfter the failed coup DİTİB published a sermon praising ""our noble nation"" for rising against ""a wretched network"" that had sown ""seeds of sedition, rebellion and hostility.""According to Volker Beck, a member of the center-left Greens in Germany\'s Bundestag, ""That was not a religious text.It was a declaration of obedience to Mr. Erdoğan and his measures since the coup attempt,"" Volker Kauder, parliamentary group leader of the Germany\'s ruling Christian Democrats, the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU)/Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) faction, said Turkish-Germans should be loyal to Germany first and foremost.\n\nGermans of Turkish origin are being pressured in Germany by informers and officers of Turkey\'s MIT spy agency.According to reports Turkey had 6,000 informants plus MIT officers in Germany who were putting pressure on ""German Turks"".Hans-Christian Ströbele said that there was an ""unbelievable"" level of ""secret activities"" in Germany by Turkey\'s MIT agency.According to Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, not even the former communist East German Stasi secret police had managed to run such a large ""army of agents"" in the former West Germany: ""Here, it\'s not just about intelligence gathering, but increasingly about intelligence service repression.""\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nGermany\'s Office for Migration and Refugees said on 18 November 2016, it had received 4,437 political asylum requests from Turkish citizens up to October, compared to 1,767 for the whole of last year.""We must expect that the number of Turks who are seeking political asylum in Germany will continue to rise,"" said Stephan Mayer, the domestic policy speaker of the union coalition in the Bundestag.\n\nOn 10 December 2016, eleven Turkish nationals, 10 adults and one child, in a martial arts group have applied for asylum in Germany.\n\nAs of January 2018, Germany was first place and Greece second as EU destinations of choice for Turkish nationals requesting asylum after the coup attempt.\n\nTurkish police have carried out simultaneous raids in 18 cities against companies associated with United States-based Fethullah Gülen.The state-run Anadolu Agency said police searched 204 premises and detained 187 businessmen for ""membership in a terror organization"" and ""providing financial support to a terror organization"".All suspects\' assets were seized.\n\nWikiLeaks released Turkish emails and documents to respond to the Turkish government\'s purges that followed the coup attempt.In turn, the Turkish Telecommunications Communications Board blocked access to the WikiLeaks website.On 17 July 2016 Wikileaks had announced on Twitter, the leak of approximately 300,000 emails and over 500,000 documents, including those to and from AKP.\n\nWikiLeaks stated that it was attacked shortly after 17 July announcement of the planned publication and hypothesized that Turkish authorities were responsible.WikiLeaks stated in a tweet, ""our infrastructure is under sustained attack.""Tweets from WikiLeaks include ""We are unsure of the true origin of the attack.The timing suggests a Turkish state power faction or its allies.We will prevail & publish.""and: ""Turks will likely be censored to prevent them reading our pending release of 100k+ docs on politics leading up to the coup."", ""We ask that Turks are ready with censorship bypassing systems such as TorBrowser and uTorrent""; ""And that everyone else is ready to help them bypass censorship and push our links through the censorship to come.""\n\nUpon the release of the email dump, it has been reported that the emails contain little to no damning information, and instead are just mails from a public mailing list, but also linked externally to ""voter information on all of the women registered to vote in 78 out of Turkey\'s 81 provinces"".\n\nSeveral places were renamed to commemorate the failed coup: Boğaziçi Köprüsü (Bosphorus Bridge) → 15 Temmuz Şehitler Köprüsü Kızılay Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Kızılay Demokrasi Meydanı Ahmet Taner Kışlalı Meydanı → 15 Temmuz Milli İrade Meydanı (Reverted to original name a few days later) Büyük İstanbul Otogarı → İstanbul 15 Temmuz Demokrasi Otogarı In TRT, Yeni Haber Stüdyosu → 15 Temmuz Millet Stüdyosu Kazan → Kahramankazan about the province\'s local people\'s resistance to the coup plotters.Kahraman means ""hero"" in Turkish Niğde University → Niğde Ömer Halisdemir University\n\nIn 2018, the Istanbul Municipal Council decided to change the names of a total of 90 streets that included words which could be associated with FETÖ.\n\nThe Presidency of Religious Affairs stated that it would not be providing religious funeral services to the dead coupists, except for ""privates and low-ranking officers compelled by force and threats who found themselves in the midst of the conflict without full knowledge of anything"".\n\nA document dated 26 September 2016 showed that Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) asked Turkish missions and religious representatives abroad to profile Gülen movement expatriates living in their respective foreign countries.Gülen-linked schools, businesses, foundations, associations, media outlets and others were also included in the reports.Turkey\'s Directorate of Religious Affairs has gathered intelligence via imams from 38 countries.\n\nBelgium officials said they would withdraw recognition of Diyanet mosques in the country if necessary.\n\nGerman lawmakers have called for an investigation, charging that Turkey is spying on suspected Gulen followers in Germany.\n\nOn 21 December 2016, the Turkish government has recalled Yusuf Acar, the religious affairs attaché of the Turkish Embassy in the Netherlands, after Dutch authorities said he was spying.Acar collected information of people who sympathize with Fethullah Gülen at Netherlands and passed it on to the Turkish authorities.The Dutch government called spying activities an ""unwanted and non-acceptable interference in the lives of Dutch citizens.""and the attaché was reportedly declared persona non grata and received a ""deportation warning"" by Dutch authorities.\n\nOn 26 January 2017, President Erdoğan, during his visit to Tanzania, asked his Tanzanian counterpart John Magufuli to take action against the network of Fethullah Gülen.\n\nIn April 2017 it was announced that President Erdoğan planned to establish a purpose-built museum dedicated to the coup events, called the ""Museum of the 15 July: Martyrs and Democracy"", to be located in Kahramankazan, a town near Ankara.Paid for by Turkish Ministry of Culture funds, it is planned to open at the end of 2018.The museum opened in December 2019\n\nAmong the Turkish opposition parties, the Republican People\'s Party (CHP) issued a statement expressing their public opposition to the coup, and the Hürriyet Daily News reported that Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bahçeli telephoned Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım to express his opposition to the coup.The co-chairs of the opposition Peoples\' Democratic Party (HDP) issued a statement saying that the party was ""under all circumstances and as a matter of principle against all kinds of coup.""Amongst the minor parties, left-wing nationalist Patriotic Party\'s Doğu Perinçek backed democracy, when he held Gülen and the Americans responsible.Kurdish militant separatist organization Kurdistan Workers\' Party, which Turkey and its allies label as a terrorist organization, urged their supporters to stay away from the coup and rather defend their people, while the Communist Party called upon the people to overthrow the AKP government which they called an ""enemy of humanity"".\n\nDuring the first hours of the coup plotters\' moves of blocking Istanbul\'s bridges and flying fighter jets low over Istanbul and Ankara, Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjørn Jagland tweeted against the coup attempt and underlined that ""any attempt to overthrow the democratically elected leaders is unacceptable"".\n\nRussia\'s President Vladimir Putin called Erdoğan out of solidarity before all NATO member countries\' heads following the coup attempt.Erdoğan thanked the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev – who was the first president to show solidarity after the coup attempt – for his support in solving the 7-month crisis over downed Russian Sukhoi Su-24 and the Prime Minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, who was among the first NATO country leaders to condemn the coup attempt, already from the early hours of Saturday.\n\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the then prime minister of Pakistan, was all praise for the people of Turkey and the AKP government and strongly condemned what he termed as an attempt to undermine democracy in Turkey.""We deeply admire the resolve of the brave and resilient Turkish people, who stood up against the forces of darkness and anarchy to express their support and commitment to democracy,"" the PM said in a statement issued from his office.\n\nThe majority of countries either expressed their support for the government or called for restraint.On 16 July 2016, however, a proposed United Nations Security Council statement denouncing the coup was not accepted by Egypt, a non-permanent member of the Council at the time, due to textual disagreements.Egyptian diplomats said that the council is ""in no position to qualify, or label [the Turkish] government – or any other government for that matter – as democratically elected or not"".Objection by the United States and the UK – permanent members of the Security Council – led to Egypt proposing a new statement calling for all sides to ""respect the democratic and constitutional principles and the rule of law"", which was rejected, preventing the condemnation of the coup attempt by the Security Council.The leader of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky supported the coup attempt.\n\nAl-Monitor reported that ""Unlike Ankara\'s Western allies, Iran did not wait for the coup\'s failure to speak up.Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif voiced support for democracy in a Twitter message in the early hours of the unrest, writing ""Stability, and democracy in Turkey are paramount"".In a subsequent phone call after the failure of the coup attempt, President Hassan Rouhani told Erdoğan the coup attempt was ""a test to identify your domestic and foreign friends and enemies.""An Iranian official pointed out parallels between the coup attempt in Turkey and the coup against Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mussadiq in 1953: ""What we know is that this attempt was triggered by foreign hands.We have experienced the same thing in the past.Since Mr. Erdogan wants to play a more positive path in the region today, they want to overthrow him.""\n\nMustafa Akıncı, President of Northern Cyprus, welcomed the fact that ""no community in Turkey ... applauded the coup as they have done in the past.""Azerbaijan strongly condemned the attempted military coup in Turkey and considered such actions unacceptable according to a statement from Novruz Mammadov, deputy head of the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration and chief of the foreign relations department.\n\nEuropean Commissioner dealing with Turkey\'s EU membership bid, Johannes Hahn, said it appears Turkey\'s government prepared arrest lists of political opponents before the coup attempt and had been waiting for the right time to act.In this sense, EU reported that as a main criticism to put this issue in the category of terrorism become the violation of the fundamental rights and fundamental values of the citizens.Hence, it underlines a total divergence of opinions and mentality between EU and Turkey which reached a deadlock here especially after the 15th of July in 2016.\n\nOn 19 July 2016, White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said during a press briefing that President Barack Obama has held a phone conversation with President Erdoğan: ""The President used the phone call to reiterate once again the strong commitment of the United States to the democratically elected civilian government of Turkey.The President pledged any needed assistance to the Turkish government as they conduct an investigation to determine exactly what happened.""\n\nOn 20 July 2016, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""Turkey has a large armed force, professional armed forces and ...I am certain they will continue as a committed and strong NATO ally.""On a statement released on 10 August 2016, the Secretary General once more strongly condemned the attempted coup and reiterated full support for Turkey\'s democratic institutions.He also expressed support for the elected Turkish government and respect for the courage of the Turkish people for resisting the coup plotters.\n\nOn 29 July 2016, the commander of U.S. Central Command, General Joseph Votel, denied statements by Turkey\'s president Erdoğan that he has supported the coup attempt in Turkey.\n\nOn 1 August 2016, United States Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, General Joseph Dunford, visited Turkey and condemned the coup attempt.Dunford said: ""The consistent theme throughout the day was a reaffirmation of the importance of the U.S.-Turkey relationship – the need for us to cooperate.""\n\nOn July, 20, there were reports that a group of Turkish military commandos coup fugitives would try to cross from Turkey to the island of Symi, in the southeastern Aegean, at Greece.The Hellenic Coast Guard was on alert and increased the patrols in the area, especially after a group of inflatable dinghies and other vessels were seen departing from Datça, on the Turkish coast, in the direction of Symi, they monitored the movements of the Turkish vessels, which remained in Turkish waters.Furthermore, a contingent of the Hellenic Police was dispatched to Symi to conduct checks there.The Greek government had been anticipating a possible attempt by participants in the failed coup to come to Greece and took the reports seriously.Turkish F-16 fighter jets were also scrambled to check reports that missing Turkish coast guard vessels had appeared in Greek waters in the Aegean.Later on the day, the Turkish interior ministry denied reports that rebel soldiers might have ""hijacked"" a vessel to flee to Greece.The Greek armed forces remained on alert the throughout the day for potential coup fugitives.\n\nAccording to Michael Rubin, from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Erdoğan had himself to blame for the coup.Following an increasingly Islamist agenda, Erdoğan had reportedly ""dropped any pretense of governing for all Turks.""After ""fanning the flames"" at the 2013 Gezi Park protests, he transformed the predominantly Kurdish-inhabited areas of southeastern Turkey ""into a war zone reminiscent of the worst days of the 1980s.""The biggest problem, according to Rubin, might have been Erdoğan\'s foreign policy, which managed to turn the initial ""no problems with neighbors"" doctrine into a situation where the country has problems with almost every neighbor and has even alienated some of its allies and friends.Rubin previously worked as an official at the Pentagon and less than 4 months before the coup, he wrote an article in Newsweek magazine titled, ""Will There Be a Coup Against Erdogan in Turkey?""\n\nBritish Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk warned that ""too late did Erdoğan realize the cost of the role he had chosen for his country.It\'s one thing to say sorry to Putin and patch up relations with Netanyahu; but when you can no longer trust your army, there are more serious matters to concentrate upon.""Even if this coup may have failed, Fisk expected another to follow in the months or years to come.\n\nTurkish professor Akın Ünver described the coup d\'état attempt as ""more of a mutiny"".\n\nThe name of the ""Peace at Home Council"" – Yurtta Sulh Konseyi – is derived from Atatürk\'s famous saying \'Peace at Home, Peace in the World\'.Journalist Ezgi Başaran said that ""the statement of the junta, that was [...] read on the [...] government TV [channel] as the coup got under way, bore a strong resemblance to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk\'s famous address to the Turkish Youth.[...] On the other hand, given that these references are too obvious, they may have been intentionally included to insinuate a Kemalist junta rather than a Gülenist one.""\n\nThe citizen journalism site Bellingcat published an analysis of the messages of a WhatsApp group consisting of high-ranking military officials who had taken part in the coup covering their activities including them killing several people.The messages were cross referenced with video footage.The group was named ""Yurtta sulh"" which refers to a peace at home speech and they seem secular and military with no references to Gülen or anything related during the several hours of messaging.\n\nNews reports have suggested that the coup ringleader was Adil Öksüz.Some believe Öksüz to have been an operative with Turkish intelligence.\n\nGerman Islamic studies scholar said the putschists tried to forestall a large-scale purge of judiciary and military, the implementation of which had already started on Saturday, the day after the coup attempt.According to Turkish investigative journalist Ahmet Şık, a list of officials to be purged had been ready compiled by the attorney-general of Izmir, Okan Bato, and was approved by President Erdoğan.According to this version, the putschists had to quickly bring forward their coup attempt before being disposed and arrested.\n\nDuring and after the events, several politicians and commentators suggested that the government knew about the coup in advance and possibly directed it.The facts that the coup attempt began in the evening rather than at a more inconspicuous time and that the events were largely confined to Ankara and Istanbul contributed to doubts about the authenticity of the coup attempt.Journalists and opposition politicians branded it a \'tragic comedy\' and \'theatre play\'.Advocates of such theories pointed to how Erdoğan stood to gain from the coup attempt in terms of increasing his popularity and support for his calls for an executive presidency, while being able to legitimize further crackdowns on judicial independence and the opposition in general.\n\nOther elements that were reported to support the theory included: no list of demands by the coup plotters, the organization and response of the police, the long lists of arrests that seemed to be ready surprisingly quickly (including arrests of 2,745 judges and 2,839 soldiers), and the obvious nature of the coup actions.\n\nFethullah Gülen, whom Erdoğan had said as being one of the principal conspirators, commented, ""I don\'t believe that the world believes the accusations made by President Erdoğan.There is a possibility that it could be a staged coup and it could be meant for further accusations [against the Gülenists].""Journalist Cengiz Çandar, a veteran observer of Turkey\'s coups, said ""I have never seen any with this magnitude of such inexplicable sloppiness.""Prominent Hizmet (Gülen movement) spokesman Alp Aslandogan said, referencing that the Turkish Air Force commander met with Erdoğan before 15 July, that certain legal documentation related to the coup seemed written beforehand, arguing that within ""the indictment written by a prosecutor on the night of 15 July to 16 July, there were events there that didn\'t actually happen.Some events did happen, but those events didn\'t happen by the time the document started.It looks like a bigger plan was there, and part of the plan did not come to pass.""\n\nThe organization and spontaneous synchronization by large numbers of mosques was perceived to be unachievable unless there had been prior preparation, with journalists also pointing to how Erdoğan could have strategically used the call to prayer to invoke religious sentiment in a political situation as a veiled attack on state secularism.\n\nThousands of arrests and purges were conducted by Turkish authorities between 16 and 18 July 2016.The sheer number of these arrests made at such a speed could only be done so if the ""Turkish government had all those lists ready"", as suggested by Johannes Hahn, European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, on 18 July 2016.Hahn also said that because these lists were already available immediately after the coup, the ""event was prepared"" and the lists were to be used ""at a certain stage"".\n\nMehmet Dişli, who was seen giving orders to the coup plotters and who was the one who put a belt around Hulusi Akar\'s neck to make him sign, is the brother of Şaban Dişli, a former vice president of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and confidant of Erdoğan.\n\nSeveral social media users have compared the coup attempt to the Reichstag fire in 1933, which Adolf Hitler used as an excuse to suspend civil liberties and order mass arrests of his opponents.Politico correspondent Ryan Heath said that ""the coup was staged to allow Erdoğan to purge the military of opponents and increase his grip on the country"".Heath used Twitter to share comments from his Turkish source, who called the events of Friday night a ""fake coup"" which would help a ""fake democracy warrior"" (referring to Erdoğan).The source said: ""Probably we\'ll see an early election [in] which he\'ll try to guarantee an unbelievable majority of the votes.And this will probably guarantee another 10–15 years of authoritarian, elected dictatorship.""\n\nThe New York Times reported that some Turkish citizens believed the coup attempt was staged by Erdoğan to improve his public image and popularity, while cracking down on political opponents and expanding his power.Critics found it suspect that reportedly no government officials were arrested or harmed during the attempted coup, which—among other factors—raised the suspicion of a false flag event staged by the Turkish government to crack down on opposition parties.Those in Turkey suggesting that the coup was staged are also being questioned by the government.\n\nPoliticians and journalists who were skeptical of the authenticity of the coup plot said that in reality, a \'civil coup\' had effectively been staged against the Armed Forces and Judiciary, both of which were extensively purged of stated Gülen supporters by the government shortly after the events.Skeptics said that the coup would be used as an excuse for further erosion of judicial independence and a crackdown on the opposition, giving the AKP greater and unstoppable power over all state institutions and paving the way for a more radical Islamist agenda at odds with the founding principles of the Turkish Republic.\n\nJustice Minister Bekir Bozdağ said in late July 2016 that Turkish social media users who said the government was staging the coup faced investigation: ""Just look at the people who are saying on social media that this was theatre.Public prosecutors are already investigating them.Most of them are losers who think it is an honor to die for Fethullah Gülen\'s command.""\n\nOn 12 July 2017, Stockholm Center for Freedom, a monitoring group with reported links to the Gülen movement, published a controversial report stating that President Erdogan orchestrated the coup bid as a false flag to consolidate his powers, set up his opposition for a mass persecution, and push Turkish Armed Forces into a military incursion into Syria.According to the report, it uncovered new evidence from 11 July 2016, four days before the planned coup bid, that a secret plan was circulated among select group of Armed Forces to give an appearance of a coup attempt.The plan was sanctioned by intelligence and military chiefs with the approval of Erdogan.\n\nIn early November 2017, Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for , former Director of the Middle East Program of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, stating that he is an agent of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), that he was present in Istanbul during the 2016 Turkish coup attempt, and that he was one of the key organizers behind the coup attempt.Around 1 December, the Istanbul prosecutor\'s office issued an arrest warrant for Graham E. Fuller, an American author and political analyst specializing in Islamic extremism after a long CIA career and holding the role of vice-chair of the United States National Intelligence Council.The prosecutor\'s office based the warrant on suspicion of Fuller helping to plan the coup attempt.Hürriyet stated that Turkish authorities believed that they had traced Fuller\'s location before the attempted coup and afterward when he left Turkey.\n\nBarkey denied his reported role in the coup, describing the claims as ""so ludicrous that they do not even deserve the term \'science fiction\'.""\n\nDeep state in Turkey The Imam\'s Army List of coups and coup attempts since 2010 List of modern conflicts in the Middle East List of attacks on legislatures\n', 'Claim_Context': 'In March 2017, Germany\'s intelligence chief said Germany was unconvinced by Erdoğan\'s statement that Fethullah Gülen was behind the failed coup attempt.
