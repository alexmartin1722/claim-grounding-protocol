its roof and flèche (spire) were of wood (much of it 13th-century oak), sheathed in lead to exclude water.The spire was rebuilt several times, most recently in the 19th century.\n\nThe cathedral\'s stonework has been severely eroded by years of weather and pollution, and the spire had extensively rotted because fissures in its lead sheathing were admitting water.The roof timbers were dry, spongy and powdery with age.In 2014, the Ministry of Culture estimated needed renovations at €150million, and in 2016 the Archdiocese of Paris launched an appeal to raise €100million over the following five to ten years.At the time of the fire, the spire was undergoing restoration and scaffolding was being erected over the transept.\n\nExtensive attention had been given to the risk of fire at the cathedral.The Paris Fire Brigade drilled regularly to prepare for emergencies there, including on-site exercises in 2018; a firefighter was posted to the cathedral each day; and fire wardens checked conditions beneath the roof three times daily.\n\nFire broke out in the attic beneath the cathedral\'s roof at 18:18.At 18:20 the fire alarm sounded and guards evacuated the cathedral; a guard was sent to investigate, but to the wrong location—the attic of the adjoining sacristy—where he found no fire.About fifteen minutes later the error was discovered, but by the time guards had climbed the three hundred steps to the cathedral attic the fire was well advanced.The alarm system was not designed to automatically notify the fire brigade, which was summoned at 18:51 after the guards had returned.Firefighters arrived within ten minutes.\n\nPolice evacuated the Île de la Cité, the island in the river Seine where the cathedral is located.White smoke was seen rising from the roof, which turned black before flames appeared from the spire, then turned yellow.\n\nMore than 400 firefighters were engaged; another hundred government workers moved precious objects to safety via a human chain also including police and municipal workers.\n\nThe fire was primarily fought from inside the structure, which was more dangerous for personnel but reduced potential damage to the cathedral; applying water from outside risked deflecting flames and hot gases (at temperatures up to 800°C or 1500°F) inwards.Deluge guns were used at lower-than-usual pressures to minimise damage to the cathedral and its contents, with water that was supplied by pump-boat from the Seine.\n\nAerial firefighting was not used because water dropped from heights could have caused structural damage, and heated stone can crack if suddenly cooled.Helicopters were not used because of dangerous updrafts, but drones were used for visual and thermal imaging, and robots were used for visual imaging and directing water streams.Molten lead falling from the roof posed a special hazard for firefighters.\n\nBy 18:52, smoke was visible from outside; flames appeared in the next ten minutes, as firefighters arrived.The spire of the cathedral collapsed at 19:50, creating a draft that slammed all the doors and sent a fireball through the attic.Firefighters then retreated from within the attic.Shortly before the spire fell, the fire had spread to the wooden framework inside the north tower, which supported eight very large bells.Had the bells fallen, it was thought that the damage done as they fell could have collapsed the towers, and with them the entire cathedral.At 20:30, firefighters abandoned attempts to extinguish the roof and concentrated on saving the towers, fighting from within and between the towers.By 21:45 the fire was under control.\n\nAdjacent apartment buildings were evacuated owing to concern about possible collapse, but on 19 April the fire brigade ruled out that risk.One firefighter and two police officers were injured.\n\nMost of the wood/metal roof and the spire of the cathedral was destroyed, with about one third of the roof remaining.The remnants of the roof and spire fell atop the stone vault underneath, which forms the ceiling of the cathedral\'s interior.Some sections of this vaulting collapsed in turn, allowing debris from the burning roof to fall to the marble floor below, but most sections remained intact owing to the use of rib vaulting, greatly reducing damage to the cathedral\'s interior and objects within.\n\nThe cathedral contained a large number of artworks, religious relics, and other irreplaceable treasures, including a crown of thorns said to be the one Jesus wore at his crucifixion, a purported piece of the cross on which Jesus was crucified, the Tunic of St. Louis, a much-rebuilt pipe organ by Aristide Cavaillé-Coll, and the 14th-century Virgin of Paris statue.\n\nSome artwork had been removed in preparation for the renovations, and most of the cathedral\'s sacred relics were held in the adjoining sacristy, which the fire did not reach; all the cathedral\'s relics survived.Some contents were moved by a human chain of emergency workers and civil servants.Many valuables that were not removed also survived, but the state of many others remained unknown as of 16 April 2019.\n\nLead joints in some of the 19th-century stained-glass windows melted, but the three major rose windows, dating to the 13th century, were undamaged.One weakened window may need to be dismantled for safekeeping.Several pews were destroyed, and the vaulted arches were blackened by smoke, though the church\'s main cross and altar survived, along with the statues surrounding it.\n\nSome paintings, apparently only smoke-damaged, are expected to be transported to the Louvre for restoration.A number of statues, including those of the twelve Apostles at the base of the spire, had been removed in preparation for renovations.The rooster-shaped reliquary atop the spire was found damaged but intact among the debris.The three pipe organs were not significantly damaged.The largest of the cathedral\'s bells, the bourdon, was not damaged.The liturgical treasury of the cathedral and the ""grands Mays"" paintings were moved to safety.\n\nAirparif, an air quality monitoring organization, said winds rapidly dispersed the smoke, carrying it away aloft along the Seine corridor.It did not find elevated levels of particulate air pollution at monitoring stations nearby.The Paris police have stated that there was no danger from breathing the air around the fire.\n\nThe burned-down roof had been covered with over 400 metric tons of lead.Settling dust substantially raised surface lead levels in some places nearby, notably the cordoned-off area and places left open during the fire.Wet cleaning for surfaces and blood tests for children and pregnant women were recommended in the immediate area.People working on the cathedral after the fire did not initially take the required lead precautions; materials leaving the site were decontaminated, but some clothing was not, and some precautions were not correctly followed; as a result, the worksite failed some inspections and was temporarily shut down.There was also more widespread contamination; testing, cleanup, and public health advisories were delayed for months, and the neighbourhood was not decontaminated for four months, prompting widespread criticism.\n\nAverage lead levels in Paris streets are normally five times the indoor legal limit () owing to historic uses of lead, principally from runoff from intact roofs.The Health Ministry rules that children should not be exposed to more than 70 micrograms/m² indoors.There is no legal limit for outdoor lead levels, which are often very heterogeneous; the L\'Agence régionale de santé (ARS) d\'Ile-de-France is not certain if some of the elevated levels being measured are connected to the fire.This lack of clarity and threshold-linked mandatory measures may have delayed action.In mid-July, regional health officials raised their outdoor guideline from 1000 micrograms/m² to 5000.Rain can redistribute the lead dust.Samples of honey collected in July 2019 revealed higher lead concentrations downwind from Notre-Dame and lead isotopes tagged the lead as originating from the fire and not other potential sources of pollutants.\n\nPresident Macron, postponing a speech to address the yellow vests movement planned for that evening, went to Notre-Dame and gave a brief address there.Major religious leaders and representatives of numerous countries and international organisations extended condolences.\n\nThrough the night of the fire and into the next day, people gathered along the Seine to hold vigils, sing and pray.Some commentators found deeper meaning in the fire, linking it with divine judgment or the decline of Western civilisation.\n\nThe following Sunday at Saint-Eustache Church, the Archbishop of Paris, Michel Aupetit, honoured the firefighters with the presentation of a book of scriptures saved from the fire.\n\nOn 16 April, the Paris prosecutor said there was no evidence of a deliberate act.\n\nThe fire has been compared to the similar 1992 Windsor Castle fire and the Uppark fire, among others, and has raised old questions about the safety of similar structures and the techniques used to restore them.Renovation increases fire risk, and a police source reported they are looking into whether such work had caused this incident.\n\nRenovation presents a fire risk from sparks, short-circuits, and heat from welding (roof repairs involved cutting, and soldering lead sheets resting on timber).Normally, no electrical is allowed in the roof space because of the extreme fire risk.The roof framing was made of very dry timber, often powdery with age.After the fire, the architect responsible for fire safety at the cathedral acknowledged that the rate at which fire might spread had been underestimated, and experts said it was well known that a fire in the roof would be almost impossible to control.\n\nOf the firms working on the restoration, a Europe Echafaudage team was the only one working there on the day of the fire; the company said no soldering or welding was underway before the fire.The scaffolding was receiving electrical supply for temporary elevators and lighting.The roofers, Le Bras Frères, said it had followed procedure and that none of its personnel were on site when the fire broke out.Time-lapse images taken by a camera installed by them showed smoke first rising from the base of the spire.\n\nOn 25 April 2019, the structure was considered safe enough for entry of investigators, who unofficially stated that they were considering theories involving malfunction of the electric bell-ringing apparatus and cigarette butts discovered on the renovation scaffolding.Le Bras Frères confirmed its workers had smoked cigarettes, contrary to regulations, but denied that a cigarette butt could have started the fire.The Paris prosecutor\'s office announced on 26 June that no evidence had been found to suggest a criminal motive.\n\nThe security employee monitoring the alarm system was new on the job, and was on a second eight-hour shift that day because his relief had not arrived.Additionally, the fire alarm system used to locate fires was labeled in a confusing way, which contributed to the initial confusion as to the location of the fire.\n\nAs of September, determining the exact place in which the fire started was expected to take a great deal more time and work.By 15 April 2020, investigators believed ""the fire to have been started by either a cigarette or a short circuit in the electrical system"".\n\nOn the night of the fire, Macron said that the cathedral would be rebuilt, and launched an international fundraising campaign.France\'s cathedrals have been owned by the state since 1905, and are not privately insured.\n\nThe heritage conservation organisation Fondation du Patrimoine estimated the damage in the hundreds of millions of euros.Although art in the building and multiple construction companies were insured, according to President Robert Leblanc, losses from the fire are not expected to substantially impact the private insurance industry.European art insurers stated the cost would be similar to ongoing renovations of the Palace of Westminster in London, which was estimated to be around €7billion.This cost does not include damage to any of the artwork or artefacts within the cathedral; art insurers said any pieces on loan from other museums would have been insured, but the works owned by the cathedral would not have been insurable.\n\nWhile Macron hoped the cathedral could be restored in time for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, experts expect the work could take from 10 to 40 years, as any new structure would need to balance restoring the look of the original building, using wood and stone sourced from the same regions used in the original construction, with the structural reinforcement required for preventing a similar disaster in the future.\n\nThere is discussion of whether to reconstruct the cathedral in modified form.Rebuilding the roof with titanium sheets and steel trusses has been suggested; other options include rebuilding in the original lead and wood, rebuilding with modern materials not visible from the outside (like the reinforced concrete trusses at Reims Cathedral), or using a combination of restored old elements and newly designed ones.\n\nFrench prime minister Édouard Philippe announced an architectural design competition for a new spire ""adapted to the techniques and the challenges of our era.""The spire replacement project gathered a variety of designs and some controversy, particularly its legal exemption from environmental and heritage rules.After the design competition was announced, the French Senate amended the government\'s proposed restoration bill to require the roof to be restored to how it was before the fire.The National Assembly rejected this amendment, and on 16 July 2019, 95 days after the fire that destroyed the cathedral\'s roof and central spire, the law that governs the restoration of the cathedral was finally approved by the Parliament.It recognises its UNESCO World Heritage Site status and the need to respect existing international charters and practices, to ""preserve the historic, artistic and architectural history of the monument"", and to limit any derogations to the existing heritage, planning, environmental and construction codes to a minimum.It left the architectural form of the reconstruction and the spire design undetermined.\n\nOn 18 April 2019, French game developer and publisher Ubisoft offered to provide the reconstruction effort with over 5,000 hours\' worth of research on the building\'s structure, previously used to recreate the cathedral in the 2014 video game Assassin\'s Creed Unity.\n\nOn 15 April 2020, Germany offered to restore ""some of the large clerestory windows located far above eye level"" with three expert tradesmen who specialize in rebuilding cathedrals.Monika Grütters, Germany\'s Commissioner for Culture, was quoted as saying ""her country would shoulder the costs"".\n\nAs of 30 November 2020, all of the tangled scaffolding was removed from the spire area.It is no longer a threat to the building.\n\nOn 15 April 2022, French president Emmanuel Macron visited the cathedral as the country marked the third anniversary of the fire.Macron toured the site where works are being carried out to restore the iconic landmark and spoke to those undertaking the project about their progress so far.\n\nIn the spring of 2022, eight workshops of master glassmakers and locksmiths, selected across France, began the process of cleaning and restoration of the cathedral\'s stained glass windows.The Cologne Cathedral workshop from Germany joined the effort by restoring four of the stained glass windows.\n\nOn 18 August 2023, former high-ranking French general Jean-Louis Georgelin, who oversaw the cathedral\'s reconstruction since 2020, died.\n\nThe cathedral is expected to reopen in December 2024.\n\n, donations of over €1billion had been pledged for the cathedral\'s reconstruction, at least €880million of that in less than a day after Macron\'s appeal.Pledges €10M and over include:\n\nThere have been many additional pledges for smaller, or undisclosed, amounts.A proposal by former minister Jean-Jacques Aillagon that corporate donations for Notre-Dame should get a 90% tax deduction (rather than the standard 60%) was retracted after public outcry.Some donors have said they will not seek tax deductions.Donors exempted of income tax (more than half of French taxpayers, including working- and middle-class) are not eligible for such deductions.\n\n, only €80million had been collected.The minister in charge of national museums and monuments, Franck Riester, predicted that further donations would materialise as reconstruction work progressed, though it was reported that some who made pledges have renounced them because fundraising has been so successful.By September 2021 at least 320,000 donors had contributed over €840 million to the rebuilding effort.\n\nThe current status of the restoration is posted regularly by the organisation the Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris.\n\n1984 York Minster fire 2009 St Mel\'s Cathedral fire 2019 Shuri Castle fire 2024 Børsen fire Construction and renovation fires List of building or structure fires List of destroyed heritage List of fires at major places of worship\n', 'Claim_Context': 'On 15 April 2019, just before 18:20 CEST, a structural fire broke out in the roof space of Notre-Dame de Paris, a medieval Catholic cathedral in Paris, France.

other options include rebuilding in the original lead and wood, rebuilding with modern materials not visible from the outside (like the reinforced concrete trusses at Reims Cathedral), or using a combination of restored old elements and newly designed ones.\n\nFrench prime minister Édouard Philippe announced an architectural design competition for a new spire ""adapted to the techniques and the challenges of our era.""The spire replacement project gathered a variety of designs and some controversy, particularly its legal exemption from environmental and heritage rules.After the design competition was announced, the French Senate amended the government\'s proposed restoration bill to require the roof to be restored to how it was before the fire.The National Assembly rejected this amendment, and on 16 July 2019, 95 days after the fire that destroyed the cathedral\'s roof and central spire, the law that governs the restoration of the cathedral was finally approved by the Parliament.It recognises its UNESCO World Heritage Site status and the need to respect existing international charters and practices, to ""preserve the historic, artistic and architectural history of the monument"", and to limit any derogations to the existing heritage, planning, environmental and construction codes to a minimum.It left the architectural form of the reconstruction and the spire design undetermined.\n\nOn 18 April 2019, French game developer and publisher Ubisoft offered to provide the reconstruction effort with over 5,000 hours\' worth of research on the building\'s structure, previously used to recreate the cathedral in the 2014 video game Assassin\'s Creed Unity.\n\nOn 15 April 2020, Germany offered to restore ""some of the large clerestory windows located far above eye level"" with three expert tradesmen who specialize in rebuilding cathedrals.Monika Grütters, Germany\'s Commissioner for Culture, was quoted as saying ""her country would shoulder the costs"".\n\nAs of 30 November 2020, all of the tangled scaffolding was removed from the spire area.It is no longer a threat to the building.\n\nOn 15 April 2022, French president Emmanuel Macron visited the cathedral as the country marked the third anniversary of the fire.Macron toured the site where works are being carried out to restore the iconic landmark and spoke to those undertaking the project about their progress so far.\n\nIn the spring of 2022, eight workshops of master glassmakers and locksmiths, selected across France, began the process of cleaning and restoration of the cathedral\'s stained glass windows.The Cologne Cathedral workshop from Germany joined the effort by restoring four of the stained glass windows.\n\nOn 18 August 2023, former high-ranking French general Jean-Louis Georgelin, who oversaw the cathedral\'s reconstruction since 2020, died.\n\nThe cathedral is expected to reopen in December 2024.\n\n, donations of over €1billion had been pledged for the cathedral\'s reconstruction, at least €880million of that in less than a day after Macron\'s appeal.Pledges €10M and over include:\n\nThere have been many additional pledges for smaller, or undisclosed, amounts.A proposal by former minister Jean-Jacques Aillagon that corporate donations for Notre-Dame should get a 90% tax deduction (rather than the standard 60%) was retracted after public outcry.Some donors have said they will not seek tax deductions.Donors exempted of income tax (more than half of French taxpayers, including working- and middle-class) are not eligible for such deductions.\n\n, only €80million had been collected.The minister in charge of national museums and monuments, Franck Riester, predicted that further donations would materialise as reconstruction work progressed, though it was reported that some who made pledges have renounced them because fundraising has been so successful.By September 2021 at least 320,000 donors had contributed over €840 million to the rebuilding effort.\n\nThe current status of the restoration is posted regularly by the organisation the Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris.\n\n1984 York Minster fire 2009 St Mel\'s Cathedral fire 2019 Shuri Castle fire 2024 Børsen fire Construction and renovation fires List of building or structure fires List of destroyed heritage List of fires at major places of worship\n', 'Claim_Context': 'On 15 April 2019, just before 18:20 CEST, a structural fire broke out in the roof space of Notre-Dame de Paris, a medieval Catholic cathedral in Paris, France.

its roof and flèche (spire) were of wood (much of it 13th-century oak), sheathed in lead to exclude water.The spire was rebuilt several times, most recently in the 19th century.\n\nThe cathedral\'s stonework has been severely eroded by years of weather and pollution, and the spire had extensively rotted because fissures in its lead sheathing were admitting water.The roof timbers were dry, spongy and powdery with age.In 2014, the Ministry of Culture estimated needed renovations at €150million, and in 2016 the Archdiocese of Paris launched an appeal to raise €100million over the following five to ten years.At the time of the fire, the spire was undergoing restoration and scaffolding was being erected over the transept.\n\nExtensive attention had been given to the risk of fire at the cathedral.The Paris Fire Brigade drilled regularly to prepare for emergencies there, including on-site exercises in 2018; a firefighter was posted to the cathedral each day; and fire wardens checked conditions beneath the roof three times daily.\n\nFire broke out in the attic beneath the cathedral\'s roof at 18:18.At 18:20 the fire alarm sounded and guards evacuated the cathedral; a guard was sent to investigate, but to the wrong location—the attic of the adjoining sacristy—where he found no fire.About fifteen minutes later the error was discovered, but by the time guards had climbed the three hundred steps to the cathedral attic the fire was well advanced.The alarm system was not designed to automatically notify the fire brigade, which was summoned at 18:51 after the guards had returned.Firefighters arrived within ten minutes.\n\nPolice evacuated the Île de la Cité, the island in the river Seine where the cathedral is located.White smoke was seen rising from the roof, which turned black before flames appeared from the spire, then turned yellow.\n\nMore than 400 firefighters were engaged; another hundred government workers moved precious objects to safety via a human chain also including police and municipal workers.\n\nThe fire was primarily fought from inside the structure, which was more dangerous for personnel but reduced potential damage to the cathedral; applying water from outside risked deflecting flames and hot gases (at temperatures up to 800°C or 1500°F) inwards.Deluge guns were used at lower-than-usual pressures to minimise damage to the cathedral and its contents, with water that was supplied by pump-boat from the Seine.\n\nAerial firefighting was not used because water dropped from heights could have caused structural damage, and heated stone can crack if suddenly cooled.Helicopters were not used because of dangerous updrafts, but drones were used for visual and thermal imaging, and robots were used for visual imaging and directing water streams.Molten lead falling from the roof posed a special hazard for firefighters.\n\nBy 18:52, smoke was visible from outside; flames appeared in the next ten minutes, as firefighters arrived.The spire of the cathedral collapsed at 19:50, creating a draft that slammed all the doors and sent a fireball through the attic.Firefighters then retreated from within the attic.Shortly before the spire fell, the fire had spread to the wooden framework inside the north tower, which supported eight very large bells.Had the bells fallen, it was thought that the damage done as they fell could have collapsed the towers, and with them the entire cathedral.At 20:30, firefighters abandoned attempts to extinguish the roof and concentrated on saving the towers, fighting from within and between the towers.By 21:45 the fire was under control.\n\nAdjacent apartment buildings were evacuated owing to concern about possible collapse, but on 19 April the fire brigade ruled out that risk.One firefighter and two police officers were injured.\n\nMost of the wood/metal roof and the spire of the cathedral was destroyed, with about one third of the roof remaining.The remnants of the roof and spire fell atop the stone vault underneath, which forms the ceiling of the cathedral\'s interior.Some sections of this vaulting collapsed in turn, allowing debris from the burning roof to fall to the marble floor below, but most sections remained intact owing to the use of rib vaulting, greatly reducing damage to the cathedral\'s interior and objects within.\n\nThe cathedral contained a large number of artworks, religious relics, and other irreplaceable treasures, including a crown of thorns said to be the one Jesus wore at his crucifixion, a purported piece of the cross on which Jesus was crucified, the Tunic of St. Louis, a much-rebuilt pipe organ by Aristide Cavaillé-Coll, and the 14th-century Virgin of Paris statue.\n\nSome artwork had been removed in preparation for the renovations, and most of the cathedral\'s sacred relics were held in the adjoining sacristy, which the fire did not reach; all the cathedral\'s relics survived.Some contents were moved by a human chain of emergency workers and civil servants.Many valuables that were not removed also survived, but the state of many others remained unknown as of 16 April 2019.\n\nLead joints in some of the 19th-century stained-glass windows melted, but the three major rose windows, dating to the 13th century, were undamaged.One weakened window may need to be dismantled for safekeeping.Several pews were destroyed, and the vaulted arches were blackened by smoke, though the church\'s main cross and altar survived, along with the statues surrounding it.\n\nSome paintings, apparently only smoke-damaged, are expected to be transported to the Louvre for restoration.A number of statues, including those of the twelve Apostles at the base of the spire, had been removed in preparation for renovations.The rooster-shaped reliquary atop the spire was found damaged but intact among the debris.The three pipe organs were not significantly damaged.The largest of the cathedral\'s bells, the bourdon, was not damaged.The liturgical treasury of the cathedral and the ""grands Mays"" paintings were moved to safety.\n\nAirparif, an air quality monitoring organization, said winds rapidly dispersed the smoke, carrying it away aloft along the Seine corridor.It did not find elevated levels of particulate air pollution at monitoring stations nearby.The Paris police have stated that there was no danger from breathing the air around the fire.\n\nThe burned-down roof had been covered with over 400 metric tons of lead.Settling dust substantially raised surface lead levels in some places nearby, notably the cordoned-off area and places left open during the fire.Wet cleaning for surfaces and blood tests for children and pregnant women were recommended in the immediate area.People working on the cathedral after the fire did not initially take the required lead precautions; materials leaving the site were decontaminated, but some clothing was not, and some precautions were not correctly followed; as a result, the worksite failed some inspections and was temporarily shut down.There was also more widespread contamination; testing, cleanup, and public health advisories were delayed for months, and the neighbourhood was not decontaminated for four months, prompting widespread criticism.\n\nAverage lead levels in Paris streets are normally five times the indoor legal limit () owing to historic uses of lead, principally from runoff from intact roofs.The Health Ministry rules that children should not be exposed to more than 70 micrograms/m² indoors.There is no legal limit for outdoor lead levels, which are often very heterogeneous; the L\'Agence régionale de santé (ARS) d\'Ile-de-France is not certain if some of the elevated levels being measured are connected to the fire.This lack of clarity and threshold-linked mandatory measures may have delayed action.In mid-July, regional health officials raised their outdoor guideline from 1000 micrograms/m² to 5000.Rain can redistribute the lead dust.Samples of honey collected in July 2019 revealed higher lead concentrations downwind from Notre-Dame and lead isotopes tagged the lead as originating from the fire and not other potential sources of pollutants.\n\nPresident Macron, postponing a speech to address the yellow vests movement planned for that evening, went to Notre-Dame and gave a brief address there.Major religious leaders and representatives of numerous countries and international organisations extended condolences.\n\nThrough the night of the fire and into the next day, people gathered along the Seine to hold vigils, sing and pray.Some commentators found deeper meaning in the fire, linking it with divine judgment or the decline of Western civilisation.\n\nThe following Sunday at Saint-Eustache Church, the Archbishop of Paris, Michel Aupetit, honoured the firefighters with the presentation of a book of scriptures saved from the fire.\n\nOn 16 April, the Paris prosecutor said there was no evidence of a deliberate act.\n\nThe fire has been compared to the similar 1992 Windsor Castle fire and the Uppark fire, among others, and has raised old questions about the safety of similar structures and the techniques used to restore them.Renovation increases fire risk, and a police source reported they are looking into whether such work had caused this incident.\n\nRenovation presents a fire risk from sparks, short-circuits, and heat from welding (roof repairs involved cutting, and soldering lead sheets resting on timber).Normally, no electrical is allowed in the roof space because of the extreme fire risk.The roof framing was made of very dry timber, often powdery with age.After the fire, the architect responsible for fire safety at the cathedral acknowledged that the rate at which fire might spread had been underestimated, and experts said it was well known that a fire in the roof would be almost impossible to control.\n\nOf the firms working on the restoration, a Europe Echafaudage team was the only one working there on the day of the fire; the company said no soldering or welding was underway before the fire.The scaffolding was receiving electrical supply for temporary elevators and lighting.The roofers, Le Bras Frères, said it had followed procedure and that none of its personnel were on site when the fire broke out.Time-lapse images taken by a camera installed by them showed smoke first rising from the base of the spire.\n\nOn 25 April 2019, the structure was considered safe enough for entry of investigators, who unofficially stated that they were considering theories involving malfunction of the electric bell-ringing apparatus and cigarette butts discovered on the renovation scaffolding.Le Bras Frères confirmed its workers had smoked cigarettes, contrary to regulations, but denied that a cigarette butt could have started the fire.The Paris prosecutor\'s office announced on 26 June that no evidence had been found to suggest a criminal motive.\n\nThe security employee monitoring the alarm system was new on the job, and was on a second eight-hour shift that day because his relief had not arrived.Additionally, the fire alarm system used to locate fires was labeled in a confusing way, which contributed to the initial confusion as to the location of the fire.\n\nAs of September, determining the exact place in which the fire started was expected to take a great deal more time and work.By 15 April 2020, investigators believed ""the fire to have been started by either a cigarette or a short circuit in the electrical system"".\n\nOn the night of the fire, Macron said that the cathedral would be rebuilt, and launched an international fundraising campaign.France\'s cathedrals have been owned by the state since 1905, and are not privately insured.\n\nThe heritage conservation organisation Fondation du Patrimoine estimated the damage in the hundreds of millions of euros.Although art in the building and multiple construction companies were insured, according to President Robert Leblanc, losses from the fire are not expected to substantially impact the private insurance industry.European art insurers stated the cost would be similar to ongoing renovations of the Palace of Westminster in London, which was estimated to be around €7billion.This cost does not include damage to any of the artwork or artefacts within the cathedral;

all the cathedral\'s relics survived.Some contents were moved by a human chain of emergency workers and civil servants.Many valuables that were not removed also survived, but the state of many others remained unknown as of 16 April 2019.\n\nLead joints in some of the 19th-century stained-glass windows melted, but the three major rose windows, dating to the 13th century, were undamaged.One weakened window may need to be dismantled for safekeeping.Several pews were destroyed, and the vaulted arches were blackened by smoke, though the church\'s main cross and altar survived, along with the statues surrounding it.\n\nSome paintings, apparently only smoke-damaged, are expected to be transported to the Louvre for restoration.A number of statues, including those of the twelve Apostles at the base of the spire, had been removed in preparation for renovations.The rooster-shaped reliquary atop the spire was found damaged but intact among the debris.The three pipe organs were not significantly damaged.The largest of the cathedral\'s bells, the bourdon, was not damaged.The liturgical treasury of the cathedral and the ""grands Mays"" paintings were moved to safety.\n\nAirparif, an air quality monitoring organization, said winds rapidly dispersed the smoke, carrying it away aloft along the Seine corridor.It did not find elevated levels of particulate air pollution at monitoring stations nearby.The Paris police have stated that there was no danger from breathing the air around the fire.\n\nThe burned-down roof had been covered with over 400 metric tons of lead.Settling dust substantially raised surface lead levels in some places nearby, notably the cordoned-off area and places left open during the fire.Wet cleaning for surfaces and blood tests for children and pregnant women were recommended in the immediate area.People working on the cathedral after the fire did not initially take the required lead precautions; materials leaving the site were decontaminated, but some clothing was not, and some precautions were not correctly followed; as a result, the worksite failed some inspections and was temporarily shut down.There was also more widespread contamination; testing, cleanup, and public health advisories were delayed for months, and the neighbourhood was not decontaminated for four months, prompting widespread criticism.\n\nAverage lead levels in Paris streets are normally five times the indoor legal limit () owing to historic uses of lead, principally from runoff from intact roofs.The Health Ministry rules that children should not be exposed to more than 70 micrograms/m² indoors.There is no legal limit for outdoor lead levels, which are often very heterogeneous; the L\'Agence régionale de santé (ARS) d\'Ile-de-France is not certain if some of the elevated levels being measured are connected to the fire.This lack of clarity and threshold-linked mandatory measures may have delayed action.In mid-July, regional health officials raised their outdoor guideline from 1000 micrograms/m² to 5000.Rain can redistribute the lead dust.Samples of honey collected in July 2019 revealed higher lead concentrations downwind from Notre-Dame and lead isotopes tagged the lead as originating from the fire and not other potential sources of pollutants.\n\nPresident Macron, postponing a speech to address the yellow vests movement planned for that evening, went to Notre-Dame and gave a brief address there.Major religious leaders and representatives of numerous countries and international organisations extended condolences.\n\nThrough the night of the fire and into the next day, people gathered along the Seine to hold vigils, sing and pray.Some commentators found deeper meaning in the fire, linking it with divine judgment or the decline of Western civilisation.\n\nThe following Sunday at Saint-Eustache Church, the Archbishop of Paris, Michel Aupetit, honoured the firefighters with the presentation of a book of scriptures saved from the fire.\n\nOn 16 April, the Paris prosecutor said there was no evidence of a deliberate act.\n\nThe fire has been compared to the similar 1992 Windsor Castle fire and the Uppark fire, among others, and has raised old questions about the safety of similar structures and the techniques used to restore them.Renovation increases fire risk, and a police source reported they are looking into whether such work had caused this incident.\n\nRenovation presents a fire risk from sparks, short-circuits, and heat from welding (roof repairs involved cutting, and soldering lead sheets resting on timber).Normally, no electrical is allowed in the roof space because of the extreme fire risk.The roof framing was made of very dry timber, often powdery with age.After the fire, the architect responsible for fire safety at the cathedral acknowledged that the rate at which fire might spread had been underestimated, and experts said it was well known that a fire in the roof would be almost impossible to control.\n\nOf the firms working on the restoration, a Europe Echafaudage team was the only one working there on the day of the fire; the company said no soldering or welding was underway before the fire.The scaffolding was receiving electrical supply for temporary elevators and lighting.The roofers, Le Bras Frères, said it had followed procedure and that none of its personnel were on site when the fire broke out.Time-lapse images taken by a camera installed by them showed smoke first rising from the base of the spire.\n\nOn 25 April 2019, the structure was considered safe enough for entry of investigators, who unofficially stated that they were considering theories involving malfunction of the electric bell-ringing apparatus and cigarette butts discovered on the renovation scaffolding.Le Bras Frères confirmed its workers had smoked cigarettes, contrary to regulations, but denied that a cigarette butt could have started the fire.The Paris prosecutor\'s office announced on 26 June that no evidence had been found to suggest a criminal motive.\n\nThe security employee monitoring the alarm system was new on the job, and was on a second eight-hour shift that day because his relief had not arrived.Additionally, the fire alarm system used to locate fires was labeled in a confusing way, which contributed to the initial confusion as to the location of the fire.\n\nAs of September, determining the exact place in which the fire started was expected to take a great deal more time and work.By 15 April 2020, investigators believed ""the fire to have been started by either a cigarette or a short circuit in the electrical system"".\n\nOn the night of the fire, Macron said that the cathedral would be rebuilt, and launched an international fundraising campaign.France\'s cathedrals have been owned by the state since 1905, and are not privately insured.\n\nThe heritage conservation organisation Fondation du Patrimoine estimated the damage in the hundreds of millions of euros.Although art in the building and multiple construction companies were insured, according to President Robert Leblanc, losses from the fire are not expected to substantially impact the private insurance industry.European art insurers stated the cost would be similar to ongoing renovations of the Palace of Westminster in London, which was estimated to be around €7billion.This cost does not include damage to any of the artwork or artefacts within the cathedral; art insurers said any pieces on loan from other museums would have been insured, but the works owned by the cathedral would not have been insurable.\n\nWhile Macron hoped the cathedral could be restored in time for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, experts expect the work could take from 10 to 40 years, as any new structure would need to balance restoring the look of the original building, using wood and stone sourced from the same regions used in the original construction, with the structural reinforcement required for preventing a similar disaster in the future.\n\nThere is discussion of whether to reconstruct the cathedral in modified form.Rebuilding the roof with titanium sheets and steel trusses has been suggested; other options include rebuilding in the original lead and wood, rebuilding with modern materials not visible from the outside (like the reinforced concrete trusses at Reims Cathedral), or using a combination of restored old elements and newly designed ones.\n\nFrench prime minister Édouard Philippe announced an architectural design competition for a new spire ""adapted to the techniques and the challenges of our era.""The spire replacement project gathered a variety of designs and some controversy, particularly its legal exemption from environmental and heritage rules.After the design competition was announced, the French Senate amended the government\'s proposed restoration bill to require the roof to be restored to how it was before the fire.The National Assembly rejected this amendment, and on 16 July 2019, 95 days after the fire that destroyed the cathedral\'s roof and central spire, the law that governs the restoration of the cathedral was finally approved by the Parliament.It recognises its UNESCO World Heritage Site status and the need to respect existing international charters and practices, to ""preserve the historic, artistic and architectural history of the monument"", and to limit any derogations to the existing heritage, planning, environmental and construction codes to a minimum.It left the architectural form of the reconstruction and the spire design undetermined.\n\nOn 18 April 2019, French game developer and publisher Ubisoft offered to provide the reconstruction effort with over 5,000 hours\' worth of research on the building\'s structure, previously used to recreate the cathedral in the 2014 video game Assassin\'s Creed Unity.\n\nOn 15 April 2020, Germany offered to restore ""some of the large clerestory windows located far above eye level"" with three expert tradesmen who specialize in rebuilding cathedrals.Monika Grütters, Germany\'s Commissioner for Culture, was quoted as saying ""her country would shoulder the costs"".\n\nAs of 30 November 2020, all of the tangled scaffolding was removed from the spire area.It is no longer a threat to the building.\n\nOn 15 April 2022, French president Emmanuel Macron visited the cathedral as the country marked the third anniversary of the fire.Macron toured the site where works are being carried out to restore the iconic landmark and spoke to those undertaking the project about their progress so far.\n\nIn the spring of 2022, eight workshops of master glassmakers and locksmiths, selected across France, began the process of cleaning and restoration of the cathedral\'s stained glass windows.The Cologne Cathedral workshop from Germany joined the effort by restoring four of the stained glass windows.\n\nOn 18 August 2023, former high-ranking French general Jean-Louis Georgelin, who oversaw the cathedral\'s reconstruction since 2020, died.\n\nThe cathedral is expected to reopen in December 2024.\n\n, donations of over €1billion had been pledged for the cathedral\'s reconstruction, at least €880million of that in less than a day after Macron\'s appeal.Pledges €10M and over include:\n\nThere have been many additional pledges for smaller, or undisclosed, amounts.A proposal by former minister Jean-Jacques Aillagon that corporate donations for Notre-Dame should get a 90% tax deduction (rather than the standard 60%) was retracted after public outcry.Some donors have said they will not seek tax deductions.Donors exempted of income tax (more than half of French taxpayers, including working- and middle-class) are not eligible for such deductions.\n\n, only €80million had been collected.The minister in charge of national museums and monuments, Franck Riester, predicted that further donations would materialise as reconstruction work progressed, though it was reported that some who made pledges have renounced them because fundraising has been so successful.By September 2021 at least 320,000 donors had contributed over €840 million to the rebuilding effort.\n\nThe current status of the restoration is posted regularly by the organisation the Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris.\n\n1984 York Minster fire 2009 St Mel\'s Cathedral fire 2019 Shuri Castle fire 2024 Børsen fire Construction and renovation fires List of building or structure fires List of destroyed heritage List of fires at major places of worship\n', 'Claim_Context': 'On 15 April 2019, just before 18:20 CEST, a structural fire broke out in the roof space of Notre-Dame de Paris, a medieval Catholic cathedral in Paris, France.

its roof and flèche (spire) were of wood (much of it 13th-century oak), sheathed in lead to exclude water.The spire was rebuilt several times, most recently in the 19th century.\n\nThe cathedral\'s stonework has been severely eroded by years of weather and pollution, and the spire had extensively rotted because fissures in its lead sheathing were admitting water.The roof timbers were dry, spongy and powdery with age.In 2014, the Ministry of Culture estimated needed renovations at €150million, and in 2016 the Archdiocese of Paris launched an appeal to raise €100million over the following five to ten years.At the time of the fire, the spire was undergoing restoration and scaffolding was being erected over the transept.\n\nExtensive attention had been given to the risk of fire at the cathedral.The Paris Fire Brigade drilled regularly to prepare for emergencies there, including on-site exercises in 2018; a firefighter was posted to the cathedral each day; and fire wardens checked conditions beneath the roof three times daily.\n\nFire broke out in the attic beneath the cathedral\'s roof at 18:18.At 18:20 the fire alarm sounded and guards evacuated the cathedral; a guard was sent to investigate, but to the wrong location—the attic of the adjoining sacristy—where he found no fire.About fifteen minutes later the error was discovered, but by the time guards had climbed the three hundred steps to the cathedral attic the fire was well advanced.The alarm system was not designed to automatically notify the fire brigade, which was summoned at 18:51 after the guards had returned.Firefighters arrived within ten minutes.\n\nPolice evacuated the Île de la Cité, the island in the river Seine where the cathedral is located.White smoke was seen rising from the roof, which turned black before flames appeared from the spire, then turned yellow.\n\nMore than 400 firefighters were engaged; another hundred government workers moved precious objects to safety via a human chain also including police and municipal workers.\n\nThe fire was primarily fought from inside the structure, which was more dangerous for personnel but reduced potential damage to the cathedral; applying water from outside risked deflecting flames and hot gases (at temperatures up to 800°C or 1500°F) inwards.Deluge guns were used at lower-than-usual pressures to minimise damage to the cathedral and its contents, with water that was supplied by pump-boat from the Seine.\n\nAerial firefighting was not used because water dropped from heights could have caused structural damage, and heated stone can crack if suddenly cooled.Helicopters were not used because of dangerous updrafts, but drones were used for visual and thermal imaging, and robots were used for visual imaging and directing water streams.Molten lead falling from the roof posed a special hazard for firefighters.\n\nBy 18:52, smoke was visible from outside;

5,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Notre-Dame fire', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'On 15 April 2019, just before 18:20 CEST, a structural fire broke out in the roof space of Notre-Dame de Paris, a medieval Catholic cathedral in Paris, France.By the time the fire was extinguished, the cathedral\'s wooden spire (flèche) had collapsed, most of the wooden roof had been destroyed, and the cathedral\'s upper walls were severely damaged.Extensive damage to the interior was prevented by the vaulted stone ceiling, which largely contained the burning roof as it collapsed.Many works of art and religious relics were moved to safety, but others suffered smoke damage, and some of the exterior art was damaged or destroyed.The cathedral\'s altar, two pipe organs, and three 13th-century rose windows suffered little or no damage.Three emergency workers were injured.The fire contaminated the site and nearby areas of Paris with toxic dust and lead.Notre-Dame did not hold a Christmas Mass in 2019, for the first time since 1803.Investigators in 2020 believed the fire to have been ""started by either a cigarette or a short circuit in the electrical system"".\n\nOn 17 April, French president Emmanuel Macron set a five-year deadline to restore the cathedral.By September 2021, donors had contributed over €840 million to the rebuilding effort.The cathedral is expected to reopen in December 2024.\n\nThe construction of the Catholic cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris (""Our Lady of Paris""), part of the ""Paris, Banks of the Seine"" UNESCO World Heritage Site, was begun in the 12th century.Its walls and interior vaulted ceiling are of stone; its roof and flèche (spire) were of wood (much of it 13th-century oak), sheathed in lead to exclude water.The spire was rebuilt several times, most recently in the 19th century.\n\nThe cathedral\'s stonework has been severely eroded by years of weather and pollution, and the spire had extensively rotted because fissures in its lead sheathing were admitting water.The roof timbers were dry, spongy and powdery with age.In 2014, the Ministry of Culture estimated needed renovations at €150million, and in 2016 the Archdiocese of Paris launched an appeal to raise €100million over the following five to ten years.At the time of the fire, the spire was undergoing restoration and scaffolding was being erected over the transept.\n\nExtensive attention had been given to the risk of fire at the cathedral.The Paris Fire Brigade drilled regularly to prepare for emergencies there, including on-site exercises in 2018; a firefighter was posted to the cathedral each day; and fire wardens checked conditions beneath the roof three times daily.\n\nFire broke out in the attic beneath the cathedral\'s roof at 18:18.At 18:20 the fire alarm sounded and guards evacuated the cathedral; a guard was sent to investigate, but to the wrong location—the attic of the adjoining sacristy—where he found no fire.About fifteen minutes later the error was discovered, but by the time guards had climbed the three hundred steps to the cathedral attic the fire was well advanced.The alarm system was not designed to automatically notify the fire brigade, which was summoned at 18:51 after the guards had returned.Firefighters arrived within ten minutes.\n\nPolice evacuated the Île de la Cité, the island in the river Seine where the cathedral is located.White smoke was seen rising from the roof, which turned black before flames appeared from the spire, then turned yellow.\n\nMore than 400 firefighters were engaged; another hundred government workers moved precious objects to safety via a human chain also including police and municipal workers.\n\nThe fire was primarily fought from inside the structure, which was more dangerous for personnel but reduced potential damage to the cathedral; applying water from outside risked deflecting flames and hot gases (at temperatures up to 800°C or 1500°F) inwards.Deluge guns were used at lower-than-usual pressures to minimise damage to the cathedral and its contents, with water that was supplied by pump-boat from the Seine.\n\nAerial firefighting was not used because water dropped from heights could have caused structural damage, and heated stone can crack if suddenly cooled.Helicopters were not used because of dangerous updrafts, but drones were used for visual and thermal imaging, and robots were used for visual imaging and directing water streams.Molten lead falling from the roof posed a special hazard for firefighters.\n\nBy 18:52, smoke was visible from outside; flames appeared in the next ten minutes, as firefighters arrived.The spire of the cathedral collapsed at 19:50, creating a draft that slammed all the doors and sent a fireball through the attic.Firefighters then retreated from within the attic.Shortly before the spire fell, the fire had spread to the wooden framework inside the north tower, which supported eight very large bells.Had the bells fallen, it was thought that the damage done as they fell could have collapsed the towers, and with them the entire cathedral.At 20:30, firefighters abandoned attempts to extinguish the roof and concentrated on saving the towers, fighting from within and between the towers.By 21:45 the fire was under control.\n\nAdjacent apartment buildings were evacuated owing to concern about possible collapse, but on 19 April the fire brigade ruled out that risk.One firefighter and two police officers were injured.\n\nMost of the wood/metal roof and the spire of the cathedral was destroyed, with about one third of the roof remaining.The remnants of the roof and spire fell atop the stone vault underneath, which forms the ceiling of the cathedral\'s interior.Some sections of this vaulting collapsed in turn, allowing debris from the burning roof to fall to the marble floor below, but most sections remained intact owing to the use of rib vaulting, greatly reducing damage to the cathedral\'s interior and objects within.\n\nThe cathedral contained a large number of artworks, religious relics, and other irreplaceable treasures, including a crown of thorns said to be the one Jesus wore at his crucifixion, a purported piece of the cross on which Jesus was crucified, the Tunic of St. Louis, a much-rebuilt pipe organ by Aristide Cavaillé-Coll, and the 14th-century Virgin of Paris statue.\n\nSome artwork had been removed in preparation for the renovations, and most of the cathedral\'s sacred relics were held in the adjoining sacristy, which the fire did not reach; all the cathedral\'s relics survived.Some contents were moved by a human chain of emergency workers and civil servants.Many valuables that were not removed also survived, but the state of many others remained unknown as of 16 April 2019.\n\nLead joints in some of the 19th-century stained-glass windows melted, but the three major rose windows, dating to the 13th century, were undamaged.One weakened window may need to be dismantled for safekeeping.Several pews were destroyed, and the vaulted arches were blackened by smoke, though the church\'s main cross and altar survived, along with the statues surrounding it.\n\nSome paintings, apparently only smoke-damaged, are expected to be transported to the Louvre for restoration.A number of statues, including those of the twelve Apostles at the base of the spire, had been removed in preparation for renovations.The rooster-shaped reliquary atop the spire was found damaged but intact among the debris.The three pipe organs were not significantly damaged.The largest of the cathedral\'s bells, the bourdon, was not damaged.The liturgical treasury of the cathedral and the ""grands Mays"" paintings were moved to safety.\n\nAirparif, an air quality monitoring organization, said winds rapidly dispersed the smoke, carrying it away aloft along the Seine corridor.It did not find elevated levels of particulate air pollution at monitoring stations nearby.The Paris police have stated that there was no danger from breathing the air around the fire.\n\nThe burned-down roof had been covered with over 400 metric tons of lead.Settling dust substantially raised surface lead levels in some places nearby, notably the cordoned-off area and places left open during the fire.Wet cleaning for surfaces and blood tests for children and pregnant women were recommended in the immediate area.People working on the cathedral after the fire did not initially take the required lead precautions; materials leaving the site were decontaminated, but some clothing was not, and some precautions were not correctly followed; as a result, the worksite failed some inspections and was temporarily shut down.There was also more widespread contamination; testing, cleanup, and public health advisories were delayed for months, and the neighbourhood was not decontaminated for four months, prompting widespread criticism.\n\nAverage lead levels in Paris streets are normally five times the indoor legal limit () owing to historic uses of lead, principally from runoff from intact roofs.The Health Ministry rules that children should not be exposed to more than 70 micrograms/m² indoors.There is no legal limit for outdoor lead levels, which are often very heterogeneous; the L\'Agence régionale de santé (ARS) d\'Ile-de-France is not certain if some of the elevated levels being measured are connected to the fire.This lack of clarity and threshold-linked mandatory measures may have delayed action.In mid-July, regional health officials raised their outdoor guideline from 1000 micrograms/m² to 5000.Rain can redistribute the lead dust.Samples of honey collected in July 2019 revealed higher lead concentrations downwind from Notre-Dame and lead isotopes tagged the lead as originating from the fire and not other potential sources of pollutants.\n\nPresident Macron, postponing a speech to address the yellow vests movement planned for that evening, went to Notre-Dame and gave a brief address there.Major religious leaders and representatives of numerous countries and international organisations extended condolences.\n\nThrough the night of the fire and into the next day, people gathered along the Seine to hold vigils, sing and pray.Some commentators found deeper meaning in the fire, linking it with divine judgment or the decline of Western civilisation.\n\nThe following Sunday at Saint-Eustache Church, the Archbishop of Paris, Michel Aupetit, honoured the firefighters with the presentation of a book of scriptures saved from the fire.\n\nOn 16 April, the Paris prosecutor said there was no evidence of a deliberate act.\n\nThe fire has been compared to the similar 1992 Windsor Castle fire and the Uppark fire, among others, and has raised old questions about the safety of similar structures and the techniques used to restore them.Renovation increases fire risk, and a police source reported they are looking into whether such work had caused this incident.\n\nRenovation presents a fire risk from sparks, short-circuits, and heat from welding (roof repairs involved cutting, and soldering lead sheets resting on timber).Normally, no electrical is allowed in the roof space because of the extreme fire risk.The roof framing was made of very dry timber, often powdery with age.After the fire, the architect responsible for fire safety at the cathedral acknowledged that the rate at which fire might spread had been underestimated, and experts said it was well known that a fire in the roof would be almost impossible to control.\n\nOf the firms working on the restoration, a Europe Echafaudage team was the only one working there on the day of the fire; the company said no soldering or welding was underway before the fire.The scaffolding was receiving electrical supply for temporary elevators and lighting.The roofers, Le Bras Frères, said it had followed procedure and that none of its personnel were on site when the fire broke out.Time-lapse images taken by a camera installed by them showed smoke first rising from the base of the spire.\n\nOn 25 April 2019, the structure was considered safe enough for entry of investigators, who unofficially stated that they were considering theories involving malfunction of the electric bell-ringing apparatus and cigarette butts discovered on the renovation scaffolding.Le Bras Frères confirmed its workers had smoked cigarettes, contrary to regulations, but denied that a cigarette butt could have started the fire.The Paris prosecutor\'s office announced on 26 June that no evidence had been found to suggest a criminal motive.\n\nThe security employee monitoring the alarm system was new on the job, and was on a second eight-hour shift that day because his relief had not arrived.Additionally, the fire alarm system used to locate fires was labeled in a confusing way, which contributed to the initial confusion as to the location of the fire.\n\nAs of September, determining the exact place in which the fire started was expected to take a great deal more time and work.By 15 April 2020, investigators believed ""the fire to have been started by either a cigarette or a short circuit in the electrical system"".\n\nOn the night of the fire, Macron said that the cathedral would be rebuilt, and launched an international fundraising campaign.France\'s cathedrals have been owned by the state since 1905, and are not privately insured.\n\nThe heritage conservation organisation Fondation du Patrimoine estimated the damage in the hundreds of millions of euros.Although art in the building and multiple construction companies were insured, according to President Robert Leblanc, losses from the fire are not expected to substantially impact the private insurance industry.European art insurers stated the cost would be similar to ongoing renovations of the Palace of Westminster in London, which was estimated to be around €7billion.This cost does not include damage to any of the artwork or artefacts within the cathedral; art insurers said any pieces on loan from other museums would have been insured, but the works owned by the cathedral would not have been insurable.\n\nWhile Macron hoped the cathedral could be restored in time for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, experts expect the work could take from 10 to 40 years, as any new structure would need to balance restoring the look of the original building, using wood and stone sourced from the same regions used in the original construction, with the structural reinforcement required for preventing a similar disaster in the future.\n\nThere is discussion of whether to reconstruct the cathedral in modified form.Rebuilding the roof with titanium sheets and steel trusses has been suggested; other options include rebuilding in the original lead and wood, rebuilding with modern materials not visible from the outside (like the reinforced concrete trusses at Reims Cathedral), or using a combination of restored old elements and newly designed ones.\n\nFrench prime minister Édouard Philippe announced an architectural design competition for a new spire ""adapted to the techniques and the challenges of our era.""The spire replacement project gathered a variety of designs and some controversy, particularly its legal exemption from environmental and heritage rules.After the design competition was announced, the French Senate amended the government\'s proposed restoration bill to require the roof to be restored to how it was before the fire.The National Assembly rejected this amendment, and on 16 July 2019, 95 days after the fire that destroyed the cathedral\'s roof and central spire, the law that governs the restoration of the cathedral was finally approved by the Parliament.It recognises its UNESCO World Heritage Site status and the need to respect existing international charters and practices, to ""preserve the historic, artistic and architectural history of the monument"", and to limit any derogations to the existing heritage, planning, environmental and construction codes to a minimum.It left the architectural form of the reconstruction and the spire design undetermined.\n\nOn 18 April 2019, French game developer and publisher Ubisoft offered to provide the reconstruction effort with over 5,000 hours\' worth of research on the building\'s structure, previously used to recreate the cathedral in the 2014 video game Assassin\'s Creed Unity.\n\nOn 15 April 2020, Germany offered to restore ""some of the large clerestory windows located far above eye level"" with three expert tradesmen who specialize in rebuilding cathedrals.Monika Grütters, Germany\'s Commissioner for Culture, was quoted as saying ""her country would shoulder the costs"".\n\nAs of 30 November 2020, all of the tangled scaffolding was removed from the spire area.It is no longer a threat to the building.\n\nOn 15 April 2022, French president Emmanuel Macron visited the cathedral as the country marked the third anniversary of the fire.Macron toured the site where works are being carried out to restore the iconic landmark and spoke to those undertaking the project about their progress so far.\n\nIn the spring of 2022, eight workshops of master glassmakers and locksmiths, selected across France, began the process of cleaning and restoration of the cathedral\'s stained glass windows.The Cologne Cathedral workshop from Germany joined the effort by restoring four of the stained glass windows.\n\nOn 18 August 2023, former high-ranking French general Jean-Louis Georgelin, who oversaw the cathedral\'s reconstruction since 2020, died.\n\nThe cathedral is expected to reopen in December 2024.\n\n, donations of over €1billion had been pledged for the cathedral\'s reconstruction, at least €880million of that in less than a day after Macron\'s appeal.Pledges €10M and over include:\n\nThere have been many additional pledges for smaller, or undisclosed, amounts.A proposal by former minister Jean-Jacques Aillagon that corporate donations for Notre-Dame should get a 90% tax deduction (rather than the standard 60%) was retracted after public outcry.Some donors have said they will not seek tax deductions.Donors exempted of income tax (more than half of French taxpayers, including working- and middle-class) are not eligible for such deductions.\n\n, only €80million had been collected.The minister in charge of national museums and monuments, Franck Riester, predicted that further donations would materialise as reconstruction work progressed, though it was reported that some who made pledges have renounced them because fundraising has been so successful.By September 2021 at least 320,000 donors had contributed over €840 million to the rebuilding effort.\n\nThe current status of the restoration is posted regularly by the organisation the Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris.\n\n1984 York Minster fire 2009 St Mel\'s Cathedral fire 2019 Shuri Castle fire 2024 Børsen fire Construction and renovation fires List of building or structure fires List of destroyed heritage List of fires at major places of worship\n', 'Claim_Context': 'On 15 April 2019, just before 18:20 CEST, a structural fire broke out in the roof space of Notre-Dame de Paris, a medieval Catholic cathedral in Paris, France.

other options include rebuilding in the original lead and wood, rebuilding with modern materials not visible from the outside (like the reinforced concrete trusses at Reims Cathedral), or using a combination of restored old elements and newly designed ones.\n\nFrench prime minister Édouard Philippe announced an architectural design competition for a new spire ""adapted to the techniques and the challenges of our era.""The spire replacement project gathered a variety of designs and some controversy, particularly its legal exemption from environmental and heritage rules.After the design competition was announced, the French Senate amended the government\'s proposed restoration bill to require the roof to be restored to how it was before the fire.The National Assembly rejected this amendment, and on 16 July 2019, 95 days after the fire that destroyed the cathedral\'s roof and central spire, the law that governs the restoration of the cathedral was finally approved by the Parliament.It recognises its UNESCO World Heritage Site status and the need to respect existing international charters and practices, to ""preserve the historic, artistic and architectural history of the monument"", and to limit any derogations to the existing heritage, planning, environmental and construction codes to a minimum.It left the architectural form of the reconstruction and the spire design undetermined.\n\nOn 18 April 2019, French game developer and publisher Ubisoft offered to provide the reconstruction effort with over 5,000 hours\' worth of research on the building\'s structure, previously used to recreate the cathedral in the 2014 video game Assassin\'s Creed Unity.\n\nOn 15 April 2020, Germany offered to restore ""some of the large clerestory windows located far above eye level"" with three expert tradesmen who specialize in rebuilding cathedrals.Monika Grütters, Germany\'s Commissioner for Culture, was quoted as saying ""her country would shoulder the costs"".\n\nAs of 30 November 2020, all of the tangled scaffolding was removed from the spire area.It is no longer a threat to the building.\n\nOn 15 April 2022, French president Emmanuel Macron visited the cathedral as the country marked the third anniversary of the fire.Macron toured the site where works are being carried out to restore the iconic landmark and spoke to those undertaking the project about their progress so far.\n\nIn the spring of 2022, eight workshops of master glassmakers and locksmiths, selected across France, began the process of cleaning and restoration of the cathedral\'s stained glass windows.The Cologne Cathedral workshop from Germany joined the effort by restoring four of the stained glass windows.\n\nOn 18 August 2023, former high-ranking French general Jean-Louis Georgelin, who oversaw the cathedral\'s reconstruction since 2020, died.\n\nThe cathedral is expected to reopen in December 2024.\n\n, donations of over €1billion had been pledged for the cathedral\'s reconstruction, at least €880million of that in less than a day after Macron\'s appeal.Pledges €10M and over include:\n\nThere have been many additional pledges for smaller, or undisclosed, amounts.A proposal by former minister Jean-Jacques Aillagon that corporate donations for Notre-Dame should get a 90% tax deduction (rather than the standard 60%) was retracted after public outcry.Some donors have said they will not seek tax deductions.Donors exempted of income tax (more than half of French taxpayers, including working- and middle-class) are not eligible for such deductions.\n\n, only €80million had been collected.The minister in charge of national museums and monuments, Franck Riester, predicted that further donations would materialise as reconstruction work progressed, though it was reported that some who made pledges have renounced them because fundraising has been so successful.By September 2021 at least 320,000 donors had contributed over €840 million to the rebuilding effort.\n\nThe current status of the restoration is posted regularly by the organisation the Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris.\n\n1984 York Minster fire 2009 St Mel\'s Cathedral fire 2019 Shuri Castle fire 2024 Børsen fire Construction and renovation fires List of building or structure fires List of destroyed heritage List of fires at major places of worship\n', 'Claim_Context': 'On 15 April 2019, just before 18:20 CEST, a structural fire broke out in the roof space of Notre-Dame de Paris, a medieval Catholic cathedral in Paris, France.

its roof and flèche (spire) were of wood (much of it 13th-century oak), sheathed in lead to exclude water.The spire was rebuilt several times, most recently in the 19th century.\n\nThe cathedral\'s stonework has been severely eroded by years of weather and pollution, and the spire had extensively rotted because fissures in its lead sheathing were admitting water.The roof timbers were dry, spongy and powdery with age.In 2014, the Ministry of Culture estimated needed renovations at €150million, and in 2016 the Archdiocese of Paris launched an appeal to raise €100million over the following five to ten years.At the time of the fire, the spire was undergoing restoration and scaffolding was being erected over the transept.\n\nExtensive attention had been given to the risk of fire at the cathedral.The Paris Fire Brigade drilled regularly to prepare for emergencies there, including on-site exercises in 2018; a firefighter was posted to the cathedral each day; and fire wardens checked conditions beneath the roof three times daily.\n\nFire broke out in the attic beneath the cathedral\'s roof at 18:18.At 18:20 the fire alarm sounded and guards evacuated the cathedral; a guard was sent to investigate, but to the wrong location—the attic of the adjoining sacristy—where he found no fire.About fifteen minutes later the error was discovered, but by the time guards had climbed the three hundred steps to the cathedral attic the fire was well advanced.The alarm system was not designed to automatically notify the fire brigade, which was summoned at 18:51 after the guards had returned.Firefighters arrived within ten minutes.\n\nPolice evacuated the Île de la Cité, the island in the river Seine where the cathedral is located.White smoke was seen rising from the roof, which turned black before flames appeared from the spire, then turned yellow.\n\nMore than 400 firefighters were engaged; another hundred government workers moved precious objects to safety via a human chain also including police and municipal workers.\n\nThe fire was primarily fought from inside the structure, which was more dangerous for personnel but reduced potential damage to the cathedral; applying water from outside risked deflecting flames and hot gases (at temperatures up to 800°C or 1500°F) inwards.Deluge guns were used at lower-than-usual pressures to minimise damage to the cathedral and its contents, with water that was supplied by pump-boat from the Seine.\n\nAerial firefighting was not used because water dropped from heights could have caused structural damage, and heated stone can crack if suddenly cooled.Helicopters were not used because of dangerous updrafts, but drones were used for visual and thermal imaging, and robots were used for visual imaging and directing water streams.Molten lead falling from the roof posed a special hazard for firefighters.\n\nBy 18:52, smoke was visible from outside; flames appeared in the next ten minutes, as firefighters arrived.The spire of the cathedral collapsed at 19:50, creating a draft that slammed all the doors and sent a fireball through the attic.Firefighters then retreated from within the attic.Shortly before the spire fell, the fire had spread to the wooden framework inside the north tower, which supported eight very large bells.Had the bells fallen, it was thought that the damage done as they fell could have collapsed the towers, and with them the entire cathedral.At 20:30, firefighters abandoned attempts to extinguish the roof and concentrated on saving the towers, fighting from within and between the towers.By 21:45 the fire was under control.\n\nAdjacent apartment buildings were evacuated owing to concern about possible collapse, but on 19 April the fire brigade ruled out that risk.One firefighter and two police officers were injured.\n\nMost of the wood/metal roof and the spire of the cathedral was destroyed, with about one third of the roof remaining.The remnants of the roof and spire fell atop the stone vault underneath, which forms the ceiling of the cathedral\'s interior.Some sections of this vaulting collapsed in turn, allowing debris from the burning roof to fall to the marble floor below, but most sections remained intact owing to the use of rib vaulting, greatly reducing damage to the cathedral\'s interior and objects within.\n\nThe cathedral contained a large number of artworks, religious relics, and other irreplaceable treasures, including a crown of thorns said to be the one Jesus wore at his crucifixion, a purported piece of the cross on which Jesus was crucified, the Tunic of St. Louis, a much-rebuilt pipe organ by Aristide Cavaillé-Coll, and the 14th-century Virgin of Paris statue.\n\nSome artwork had been removed in preparation for the renovations, and most of the cathedral\'s sacred relics were held in the adjoining sacristy, which the fire did not reach; all the cathedral\'s relics survived.Some contents were moved by a human chain of emergency workers and civil servants.Many valuables that were not removed also survived, but the state of many others remained unknown as of 16 April 2019.\n\nLead joints in some of the 19th-century stained-glass windows melted, but the three major rose windows, dating to the 13th century, were undamaged.One weakened window may need to be dismantled for safekeeping.Several pews were destroyed, and the vaulted arches were blackened by smoke, though the church\'s main cross and altar survived, along with the statues surrounding it.\n\nSome paintings, apparently only smoke-damaged, are expected to be transported to the Louvre for restoration.A number of statues, including those of the twelve Apostles at the base of the spire, had been removed in preparation for renovations.The rooster-shaped reliquary atop the spire was found damaged but intact among the debris.The three pipe organs were not significantly damaged.The largest of the cathedral\'s bells, the bourdon, was not damaged.The liturgical treasury of the cathedral and the ""grands Mays"" paintings were moved to safety.\n\nAirparif, an air quality monitoring organization, said winds rapidly dispersed the smoke, carrying it away aloft along the Seine corridor.It did not find elevated levels of particulate air pollution at monitoring stations nearby.The Paris police have stated that there was no danger from breathing the air around the fire.\n\nThe burned-down roof had been covered with over 400 metric tons of lead.Settling dust substantially raised surface lead levels in some places nearby, notably the cordoned-off area and places left open during the fire.Wet cleaning for surfaces and blood tests for children and pregnant women were recommended in the immediate area.People working on the cathedral after the fire did not initially take the required lead precautions; materials leaving the site were decontaminated, but some clothing was not, and some precautions were not correctly followed; as a result, the worksite failed some inspections and was temporarily shut down.There was also more widespread contamination; testing, cleanup, and public health advisories were delayed for months, and the neighbourhood was not decontaminated for four months, prompting widespread criticism.\n\nAverage lead levels in Paris streets are normally five times the indoor legal limit () owing to historic uses of lead, principally from runoff from intact roofs.The Health Ministry rules that children should not be exposed to more than 70 micrograms/m² indoors.There is no legal limit for outdoor lead levels, which are often very heterogeneous; the L\'Agence régionale de santé (ARS) d\'Ile-de-France is not certain if some of the elevated levels being measured are connected to the fire.This lack of clarity and threshold-linked mandatory measures may have delayed action.In mid-July, regional health officials raised their outdoor guideline from 1000 micrograms/m² to 5000.Rain can redistribute the lead dust.Samples of honey collected in July 2019 revealed higher lead concentrations downwind from Notre-Dame and lead isotopes tagged the lead as originating from the fire and not other potential sources of pollutants.\n\nPresident Macron, postponing a speech to address the yellow vests movement planned for that evening, went to Notre-Dame and gave a brief address there.Major religious leaders and representatives of numerous countries and international organisations extended condolences.\n\nThrough the night of the fire and into the next day, people gathered along the Seine to hold vigils, sing and pray.Some commentators found deeper meaning in the fire, linking it with divine judgment or the decline of Western civilisation.\n\nThe following Sunday at Saint-Eustache Church, the Archbishop of Paris, Michel Aupetit, honoured the firefighters with the presentation of a book of scriptures saved from the fire.\n\nOn 16 April, the Paris prosecutor said there was no evidence of a deliberate act.\n\nThe fire has been compared to the similar 1992 Windsor Castle fire and the Uppark fire, among others, and has raised old questions about the safety of similar structures and the techniques used to restore them.Renovation increases fire risk, and a police source reported they are looking into whether such work had caused this incident.\n\nRenovation presents a fire risk from sparks, short-circuits, and heat from welding (roof repairs involved cutting, and soldering lead sheets resting on timber).Normally, no electrical is allowed in the roof space because of the extreme fire risk.The roof framing was made of very dry timber, often powdery with age.After the fire, the architect responsible for fire safety at the cathedral acknowledged that the rate at which fire might spread had been underestimated, and experts said it was well known that a fire in the roof would be almost impossible to control.\n\nOf the firms working on the restoration, a Europe Echafaudage team was the only one working there on the day of the fire; the company said no soldering or welding was underway before the fire.The scaffolding was receiving electrical supply for temporary elevators and lighting.The roofers, Le Bras Frères, said it had followed procedure and that none of its personnel were on site when the fire broke out.Time-lapse images taken by a camera installed by them showed smoke first rising from the base of the spire.\n\nOn 25 April 2019, the structure was considered safe enough for entry of investigators, who unofficially stated that they were considering theories involving malfunction of the electric bell-ringing apparatus and cigarette butts discovered on the renovation scaffolding.Le Bras Frères confirmed its workers had smoked cigarettes, contrary to regulations, but denied that a cigarette butt could have started the fire.The Paris prosecutor\'s office announced on 26 June that no evidence had been found to suggest a criminal motive.\n\nThe security employee monitoring the alarm system was new on the job, and was on a second eight-hour shift that day because his relief had not arrived.Additionally, the fire alarm system used to locate fires was labeled in a confusing way, which contributed to the initial confusion as to the location of the fire.\n\nAs of September, determining the exact place in which the fire started was expected to take a great deal more time and work.By 15 April 2020, investigators believed ""the fire to have been started by either a cigarette or a short circuit in the electrical system"".\n\nOn the night of the fire, Macron said that the cathedral would be rebuilt, and launched an international fundraising campaign.France\'s cathedrals have been owned by the state since 1905, and are not privately insured.\n\nThe heritage conservation organisation Fondation du Patrimoine estimated the damage in the hundreds of millions of euros.Although art in the building and multiple construction companies were insured, according to President Robert Leblanc, losses from the fire are not expected to substantially impact the private insurance industry.European art insurers stated the cost would be similar to ongoing renovations of the Palace of Westminster in London, which was estimated to be around €7billion.This cost does not include damage to any of the artwork or artefacts within the cathedral;

all the cathedral\'s relics survived.Some contents were moved by a human chain of emergency workers and civil servants.Many valuables that were not removed also survived, but the state of many others remained unknown as of 16 April 2019.\n\nLead joints in some of the 19th-century stained-glass windows melted, but the three major rose windows, dating to the 13th century, were undamaged.One weakened window may need to be dismantled for safekeeping.Several pews were destroyed, and the vaulted arches were blackened by smoke, though the church\'s main cross and altar survived, along with the statues surrounding it.\n\nSome paintings, apparently only smoke-damaged, are expected to be transported to the Louvre for restoration.A number of statues, including those of the twelve Apostles at the base of the spire, had been removed in preparation for renovations.The rooster-shaped reliquary atop the spire was found damaged but intact among the debris.The three pipe organs were not significantly damaged.The largest of the cathedral\'s bells, the bourdon, was not damaged.The liturgical treasury of the cathedral and the ""grands Mays"" paintings were moved to safety.\n\nAirparif, an air quality monitoring organization, said winds rapidly dispersed the smoke, carrying it away aloft along the Seine corridor.It did not find elevated levels of particulate air pollution at monitoring stations nearby.The Paris police have stated that there was no danger from breathing the air around the fire.\n\nThe burned-down roof had been covered with over 400 metric tons of lead.Settling dust substantially raised surface lead levels in some places nearby, notably the cordoned-off area and places left open during the fire.Wet cleaning for surfaces and blood tests for children and pregnant women were recommended in the immediate area.People working on the cathedral after the fire did not initially take the required lead precautions; materials leaving the site were decontaminated, but some clothing was not, and some precautions were not correctly followed; as a result, the worksite failed some inspections and was temporarily shut down.There was also more widespread contamination; testing, cleanup, and public health advisories were delayed for months, and the neighbourhood was not decontaminated for four months, prompting widespread criticism.\n\nAverage lead levels in Paris streets are normally five times the indoor legal limit () owing to historic uses of lead, principally from runoff from intact roofs.The Health Ministry rules that children should not be exposed to more than 70 micrograms/m² indoors.There is no legal limit for outdoor lead levels, which are often very heterogeneous; the L\'Agence régionale de santé (ARS) d\'Ile-de-France is not certain if some of the elevated levels being measured are connected to the fire.This lack of clarity and threshold-linked mandatory measures may have delayed action.In mid-July, regional health officials raised their outdoor guideline from 1000 micrograms/m² to 5000.Rain can redistribute the lead dust.Samples of honey collected in July 2019 revealed higher lead concentrations downwind from Notre-Dame and lead isotopes tagged the lead as originating from the fire and not other potential sources of pollutants.\n\nPresident Macron, postponing a speech to address the yellow vests movement planned for that evening, went to Notre-Dame and gave a brief address there.Major religious leaders and representatives of numerous countries and international organisations extended condolences.\n\nThrough the night of the fire and into the next day, people gathered along the Seine to hold vigils, sing and pray.Some commentators found deeper meaning in the fire, linking it with divine judgment or the decline of Western civilisation.\n\nThe following Sunday at Saint-Eustache Church, the Archbishop of Paris, Michel Aupetit, honoured the firefighters with the presentation of a book of scriptures saved from the fire.\n\nOn 16 April, the Paris prosecutor said there was no evidence of a deliberate act.\n\nThe fire has been compared to the similar 1992 Windsor Castle fire and the Uppark fire, among others, and has raised old questions about the safety of similar structures and the techniques used to restore them.Renovation increases fire risk, and a police source reported they are looking into whether such work had caused this incident.\n\nRenovation presents a fire risk from sparks, short-circuits, and heat from welding (roof repairs involved cutting, and soldering lead sheets resting on timber).Normally, no electrical is allowed in the roof space because of the extreme fire risk.The roof framing was made of very dry timber, often powdery with age.After the fire, the architect responsible for fire safety at the cathedral acknowledged that the rate at which fire might spread had been underestimated, and experts said it was well known that a fire in the roof would be almost impossible to control.\n\nOf the firms working on the restoration, a Europe Echafaudage team was the only one working there on the day of the fire; the company said no soldering or welding was underway before the fire.The scaffolding was receiving electrical supply for temporary elevators and lighting.The roofers, Le Bras Frères, said it had followed procedure and that none of its personnel were on site when the fire broke out.Time-lapse images taken by a camera installed by them showed smoke first rising from the base of the spire.\n\nOn 25 April 2019, the structure was considered safe enough for entry of investigators, who unofficially stated that they were considering theories involving malfunction of the electric bell-ringing apparatus and cigarette butts discovered on the renovation scaffolding.Le Bras Frères confirmed its workers had smoked cigarettes, contrary to regulations, but denied that a cigarette butt could have started the fire.The Paris prosecutor\'s office announced on 26 June that no evidence had been found to suggest a criminal motive.\n\nThe security employee monitoring the alarm system was new on the job, and was on a second eight-hour shift that day because his relief had not arrived.Additionally, the fire alarm system used to locate fires was labeled in a confusing way, which contributed to the initial confusion as to the location of the fire.\n\nAs of September, determining the exact place in which the fire started was expected to take a great deal more time and work.By 15 April 2020, investigators believed ""the fire to have been started by either a cigarette or a short circuit in the electrical system"".\n\nOn the night of the fire, Macron said that the cathedral would be rebuilt, and launched an international fundraising campaign.France\'s cathedrals have been owned by the state since 1905, and are not privately insured.\n\nThe heritage conservation organisation Fondation du Patrimoine estimated the damage in the hundreds of millions of euros.Although art in the building and multiple construction companies were insured, according to President Robert Leblanc, losses from the fire are not expected to substantially impact the private insurance industry.European art insurers stated the cost would be similar to ongoing renovations of the Palace of Westminster in London, which was estimated to be around €7billion.This cost does not include damage to any of the artwork or artefacts within the cathedral; art insurers said any pieces on loan from other museums would have been insured, but the works owned by the cathedral would not have been insurable.\n\nWhile Macron hoped the cathedral could be restored in time for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, experts expect the work could take from 10 to 40 years, as any new structure would need to balance restoring the look of the original building, using wood and stone sourced from the same regions used in the original construction, with the structural reinforcement required for preventing a similar disaster in the future.\n\nThere is discussion of whether to reconstruct the cathedral in modified form.Rebuilding the roof with titanium sheets and steel trusses has been suggested; other options include rebuilding in the original lead and wood, rebuilding with modern materials not visible from the outside (like the reinforced concrete trusses at Reims Cathedral), or using a combination of restored old elements and newly designed ones.\n\nFrench prime minister Édouard Philippe announced an architectural design competition for a new spire ""adapted to the techniques and the challenges of our era.""The spire replacement project gathered a variety of designs and some controversy, particularly its legal exemption from environmental and heritage rules.After the design competition was announced, the French Senate amended the government\'s proposed restoration bill to require the roof to be restored to how it was before the fire.The National Assembly rejected this amendment, and on 16 July 2019, 95 days after the fire that destroyed the cathedral\'s roof and central spire, the law that governs the restoration of the cathedral was finally approved by the Parliament.It recognises its UNESCO World Heritage Site status and the need to respect existing international charters and practices, to ""preserve the historic, artistic and architectural history of the monument"", and to limit any derogations to the existing heritage, planning, environmental and construction codes to a minimum.It left the architectural form of the reconstruction and the spire design undetermined.\n\nOn 18 April 2019, French game developer and publisher Ubisoft offered to provide the reconstruction effort with over 5,000 hours\' worth of research on the building\'s structure, previously used to recreate the cathedral in the 2014 video game Assassin\'s Creed Unity.\n\nOn 15 April 2020, Germany offered to restore ""some of the large clerestory windows located far above eye level"" with three expert tradesmen who specialize in rebuilding cathedrals.Monika Grütters, Germany\'s Commissioner for Culture, was quoted as saying ""her country would shoulder the costs"".\n\nAs of 30 November 2020, all of the tangled scaffolding was removed from the spire area.It is no longer a threat to the building.\n\nOn 15 April 2022, French president Emmanuel Macron visited the cathedral as the country marked the third anniversary of the fire.Macron toured the site where works are being carried out to restore the iconic landmark and spoke to those undertaking the project about their progress so far.\n\nIn the spring of 2022, eight workshops of master glassmakers and locksmiths, selected across France, began the process of cleaning and restoration of the cathedral\'s stained glass windows.The Cologne Cathedral workshop from Germany joined the effort by restoring four of the stained glass windows.\n\nOn 18 August 2023, former high-ranking French general Jean-Louis Georgelin, who oversaw the cathedral\'s reconstruction since 2020, died.\n\nThe cathedral is expected to reopen in December 2024.\n\n, donations of over €1billion had been pledged for the cathedral\'s reconstruction, at least €880million of that in less than a day after Macron\'s appeal.Pledges €10M and over include:\n\nThere have been many additional pledges for smaller, or undisclosed, amounts.A proposal by former minister Jean-Jacques Aillagon that corporate donations for Notre-Dame should get a 90% tax deduction (rather than the standard 60%) was retracted after public outcry.Some donors have said they will not seek tax deductions.Donors exempted of income tax (more than half of French taxpayers, including working- and middle-class) are not eligible for such deductions.\n\n, only €80million had been collected.The minister in charge of national museums and monuments, Franck Riester, predicted that further donations would materialise as reconstruction work progressed, though it was reported that some who made pledges have renounced them because fundraising has been so successful.By September 2021 at least 320,000 donors had contributed over €840 million to the rebuilding effort.\n\nThe current status of the restoration is posted regularly by the organisation the Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris.\n\n1984 York Minster fire 2009 St Mel\'s Cathedral fire 2019 Shuri Castle fire 2024 Børsen fire Construction and renovation fires List of building or structure fires List of destroyed heritage List of fires at major places of worship\n', 'Claim_Context': 'On 15 April 2019, just before 18:20 CEST, a structural fire broke out in the roof space of Notre-Dame de Paris, a medieval Catholic cathedral in Paris, France.

its roof and flèche (spire) were of wood (much of it 13th-century oak), sheathed in lead to exclude water.The spire was rebuilt several times, most recently in the 19th century.\n\nThe cathedral\'s stonework has been severely eroded by years of weather and pollution, and the spire had extensively rotted because fissures in its lead sheathing were admitting water.The roof timbers were dry, spongy and powdery with age.In 2014, the Ministry of Culture estimated needed renovations at €150million, and in 2016 the Archdiocese of Paris launched an appeal to raise €100million over the following five to ten years.At the time of the fire, the spire was undergoing restoration and scaffolding was being erected over the transept.\n\nExtensive attention had been given to the risk of fire at the cathedral.The Paris Fire Brigade drilled regularly to prepare for emergencies there, including on-site exercises in 2018; a firefighter was posted to the cathedral each day; and fire wardens checked conditions beneath the roof three times daily.\n\nFire broke out in the attic beneath the cathedral\'s roof at 18:18.At 18:20 the fire alarm sounded and guards evacuated the cathedral; a guard was sent to investigate, but to the wrong location—the attic of the adjoining sacristy—where he found no fire.About fifteen minutes later the error was discovered, but by the time guards had climbed the three hundred steps to the cathedral attic the fire was well advanced.The alarm system was not designed to automatically notify the fire brigade, which was summoned at 18:51 after the guards had returned.Firefighters arrived within ten minutes.\n\nPolice evacuated the Île de la Cité, the island in the river Seine where the cathedral is located.White smoke was seen rising from the roof, which turned black before flames appeared from the spire, then turned yellow.\n\nMore than 400 firefighters were engaged; another hundred government workers moved precious objects to safety via a human chain also including police and municipal workers.\n\nThe fire was primarily fought from inside the structure, which was more dangerous for personnel but reduced potential damage to the cathedral; applying water from outside risked deflecting flames and hot gases (at temperatures up to 800°C or 1500°F) inwards.Deluge guns were used at lower-than-usual pressures to minimise damage to the cathedral and its contents, with water that was supplied by pump-boat from the Seine.\n\nAerial firefighting was not used because water dropped from heights could have caused structural damage, and heated stone can crack if suddenly cooled.Helicopters were not used because of dangerous updrafts, but drones were used for visual and thermal imaging, and robots were used for visual imaging and directing water streams.Molten lead falling from the roof posed a special hazard for firefighters.\n\nBy 18:52, smoke was visible from outside;

its roof and flèche (spire) were of wood (much of it 13th-century oak), sheathed in lead to exclude water.The spire was rebuilt several times, most recently in the 19th century.\n\nThe cathedral\'s stonework has been severely eroded by years of weather and pollution, and the spire had extensively rotted because fissures in its lead sheathing were admitting water.The roof timbers were dry, spongy and powdery with age.In 2014, the Ministry of Culture estimated needed renovations at €150million, and in 2016 the Archdiocese of Paris launched an appeal to raise €100million over the following five to ten years.At the time of the fire, the spire was undergoing restoration and scaffolding was being erected over the transept.\n\nExtensive attention had been given to the risk of fire at the cathedral.The Paris Fire Brigade drilled regularly to prepare for emergencies there, including on-site exercises in 2018; a firefighter was posted to the cathedral each day; and fire wardens checked conditions beneath the roof three times daily.\n\nFire broke out in the attic beneath the cathedral\'s roof at 18:18.At 18:20 the fire alarm sounded and guards evacuated the cathedral; a guard was sent to investigate, but to the wrong location—the attic of the adjoining sacristy—where he found no fire.About fifteen minutes later the error was discovered, but by the time guards had climbed the three hundred steps to the cathedral attic the fire was well advanced.The alarm system was not designed to automatically notify the fire brigade, which was summoned at 18:51 after the guards had returned.Firefighters arrived within ten minutes.\n\nPolice evacuated the Île de la Cité, the island in the river Seine where the cathedral is located.White smoke was seen rising from the roof, which turned black before flames appeared from the spire, then turned yellow.\n\nMore than 400 firefighters were engaged; another hundred government workers moved precious objects to safety via a human chain also including police and municipal workers.\n\nThe fire was primarily fought from inside the structure, which was more dangerous for personnel but reduced potential damage to the cathedral; applying water from outside risked deflecting flames and hot gases (at temperatures up to 800°C or 1500°F) inwards.Deluge guns were used at lower-than-usual pressures to minimise damage to the cathedral and its contents, with water that was supplied by pump-boat from the Seine.\n\nAerial firefighting was not used because water dropped from heights could have caused structural damage, and heated stone can crack if suddenly cooled.Helicopters were not used because of dangerous updrafts, but drones were used for visual and thermal imaging, and robots were used for visual imaging and directing water streams.Molten lead falling from the roof posed a special hazard for firefighters.\n\nBy 18:52, smoke was visible from outside; flames appeared in the next ten minutes, as firefighters arrived.The spire of the cathedral collapsed at 19:50, creating a draft that slammed all the doors and sent a fireball through the attic.Firefighters then retreated from within the attic.Shortly before the spire fell, the fire had spread to the wooden framework inside the north tower, which supported eight very large bells.Had the bells fallen, it was thought that the damage done as they fell could have collapsed the towers, and with them the entire cathedral.At 20:30, firefighters abandoned attempts to extinguish the roof and concentrated on saving the towers, fighting from within and between the towers.By 21:45 the fire was under control.\n\nAdjacent apartment buildings were evacuated owing to concern about possible collapse, but on 19 April the fire brigade ruled out that risk.One firefighter and two police officers were injured.\n\nMost of the wood/metal roof and the spire of the cathedral was destroyed, with about one third of the roof remaining.The remnants of the roof and spire fell atop the stone vault underneath, which forms the ceiling of the cathedral\'s interior.Some sections of this vaulting collapsed in turn, allowing debris from the burning roof to fall to the marble floor below, but most sections remained intact owing to the use of rib vaulting, greatly reducing damage to the cathedral\'s interior and objects within.\n\nThe cathedral contained a large number of artworks, religious relics, and other irreplaceable treasures, including a crown of thorns said to be the one Jesus wore at his crucifixion, a purported piece of the cross on which Jesus was crucified, the Tunic of St. Louis, a much-rebuilt pipe organ by Aristide Cavaillé-Coll, and the 14th-century Virgin of Paris statue.\n\nSome artwork had been removed in preparation for the renovations, and most of the cathedral\'s sacred relics were held in the adjoining sacristy, which the fire did not reach; all the cathedral\'s relics survived.Some contents were moved by a human chain of emergency workers and civil servants.Many valuables that were not removed also survived, but the state of many others remained unknown as of 16 April 2019.\n\nLead joints in some of the 19th-century stained-glass windows melted, but the three major rose windows, dating to the 13th century, were undamaged.One weakened window may need to be dismantled for safekeeping.Several pews were destroyed, and the vaulted arches were blackened by smoke, though the church\'s main cross and altar survived, along with the statues surrounding it.\n\nSome paintings, apparently only smoke-damaged, are expected to be transported to the Louvre for restoration.A number of statues, including those of the twelve Apostles at the base of the spire, had been removed in preparation for renovations.The rooster-shaped reliquary atop the spire was found damaged but intact among the debris.The three pipe organs were not significantly damaged.The largest of the cathedral\'s bells, the bourdon, was not damaged.The liturgical treasury of the cathedral and the ""grands Mays"" paintings were moved to safety.\n\nAirparif, an air quality monitoring organization, said winds rapidly dispersed the smoke, carrying it away aloft along the Seine corridor.It did not find elevated levels of particulate air pollution at monitoring stations nearby.The Paris police have stated that there was no danger from breathing the air around the fire.\n\nThe burned-down roof had been covered with over 400 metric tons of lead.Settling dust substantially raised surface lead levels in some places nearby, notably the cordoned-off area and places left open during the fire.Wet cleaning for surfaces and blood tests for children and pregnant women were recommended in the immediate area.People working on the cathedral after the fire did not initially take the required lead precautions; materials leaving the site were decontaminated, but some clothing was not, and some precautions were not correctly followed; as a result, the worksite failed some inspections and was temporarily shut down.There was also more widespread contamination; testing, cleanup, and public health advisories were delayed for months, and the neighbourhood was not decontaminated for four months, prompting widespread criticism.\n\nAverage lead levels in Paris streets are normally five times the indoor legal limit () owing to historic uses of lead, principally from runoff from intact roofs.The Health Ministry rules that children should not be exposed to more than 70 micrograms/m² indoors.There is no legal limit for outdoor lead levels, which are often very heterogeneous; the L\'Agence régionale de santé (ARS) d\'Ile-de-France is not certain if some of the elevated levels being measured are connected to the fire.This lack of clarity and threshold-linked mandatory measures may have delayed action.In mid-July, regional health officials raised their outdoor guideline from 1000 micrograms/m² to 5000.Rain can redistribute the lead dust.Samples of honey collected in July 2019 revealed higher lead concentrations downwind from Notre-Dame and lead isotopes tagged the lead as originating from the fire and not other potential sources of pollutants.\n\nPresident Macron, postponing a speech to address the yellow vests movement planned for that evening, went to Notre-Dame and gave a brief address there.Major religious leaders and representatives of numerous countries and international organisations extended condolences.\n\nThrough the night of the fire and into the next day, people gathered along the Seine to hold vigils, sing and pray.Some commentators found deeper meaning in the fire, linking it with divine judgment or the decline of Western civilisation.\n\nThe following Sunday at Saint-Eustache Church, the Archbishop of Paris, Michel Aupetit, honoured the firefighters with the presentation of a book of scriptures saved from the fire.\n\nOn 16 April, the Paris prosecutor said there was no evidence of a deliberate act.\n\nThe fire has been compared to the similar 1992 Windsor Castle fire and the Uppark fire, among others, and has raised old questions about the safety of similar structures and the techniques used to restore them.Renovation increases fire risk, and a police source reported they are looking into whether such work had caused this incident.\n\nRenovation presents a fire risk from sparks, short-circuits, and heat from welding (roof repairs involved cutting, and soldering lead sheets resting on timber).Normally, no electrical is allowed in the roof space because of the extreme fire risk.The roof framing was made of very dry timber, often powdery with age.After the fire, the architect responsible for fire safety at the cathedral acknowledged that the rate at which fire might spread had been underestimated, and experts said it was well known that a fire in the roof would be almost impossible to control.\n\nOf the firms working on the restoration, a Europe Echafaudage team was the only one working there on the day of the fire; the company said no soldering or welding was underway before the fire.The scaffolding was receiving electrical supply for temporary elevators and lighting.The roofers, Le Bras Frères, said it had followed procedure and that none of its personnel were on site when the fire broke out.Time-lapse images taken by a camera installed by them showed smoke first rising from the base of the spire.\n\nOn 25 April 2019, the structure was considered safe enough for entry of investigators, who unofficially stated that they were considering theories involving malfunction of the electric bell-ringing apparatus and cigarette butts discovered on the renovation scaffolding.Le Bras Frères confirmed its workers had smoked cigarettes, contrary to regulations, but denied that a cigarette butt could have started the fire.The Paris prosecutor\'s office announced on 26 June that no evidence had been found to suggest a criminal motive.\n\nThe security employee monitoring the alarm system was new on the job, and was on a second eight-hour shift that day because his relief had not arrived.Additionally, the fire alarm system used to locate fires was labeled in a confusing way, which contributed to the initial confusion as to the location of the fire.\n\nAs of September, determining the exact place in which the fire started was expected to take a great deal more time and work.By 15 April 2020, investigators believed ""the fire to have been started by either a cigarette or a short circuit in the electrical system"".\n\nOn the night of the fire, Macron said that the cathedral would be rebuilt, and launched an international fundraising campaign.France\'s cathedrals have been owned by the state since 1905, and are not privately insured.\n\nThe heritage conservation organisation Fondation du Patrimoine estimated the damage in the hundreds of millions of euros.Although art in the building and multiple construction companies were insured, according to President Robert Leblanc, losses from the fire are not expected to substantially impact the private insurance industry.European art insurers stated the cost would be similar to ongoing renovations of the Palace of Westminster in London, which was estimated to be around €7billion.This cost does not include damage to any of the artwork or artefacts within the cathedral; art insurers said any pieces on loan from other museums would have been insured, but the works owned by the cathedral would not have been insurable.\n\nWhile Macron hoped the cathedral could be restored in time for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, experts expect the work could take from 10 to 40 years, as any new structure would need to balance restoring the look of the original building, using wood and stone sourced from the same regions used in the original construction, with the structural reinforcement required for preventing a similar disaster in the future.\n\nThere is discussion of whether to reconstruct the cathedral in modified form.Rebuilding the roof with titanium sheets and steel trusses has been suggested; other options include rebuilding in the original lead and wood, rebuilding with modern materials not visible from the outside (like the reinforced concrete trusses at Reims Cathedral), or using a combination of restored old elements and newly designed ones.\n\nFrench prime minister Édouard Philippe announced an architectural design competition for a new spire ""adapted to the techniques and the challenges of our era.""The spire replacement project gathered a variety of designs and some controversy, particularly its legal exemption from environmental and heritage rules.After the design competition was announced, the French Senate amended the government\'s proposed restoration bill to require the roof to be restored to how it was before the fire.The National Assembly rejected this amendment, and on 16 July 2019, 95 days after the fire that destroyed the cathedral\'s roof and central spire, the law that governs the restoration of the cathedral was finally approved by the Parliament.It recognises its UNESCO World Heritage Site status and the need to respect existing international charters and practices, to ""preserve the historic, artistic and architectural history of the monument"", and to limit any derogations to the existing heritage, planning, environmental and construction codes to a minimum.It left the architectural form of the reconstruction and the spire design undetermined.\n\nOn 18 April 2019, French game developer and publisher Ubisoft offered to provide the reconstruction effort with over 5,000 hours\' worth of research on the building\'s structure, previously used to recreate the cathedral in the 2014 video game Assassin\'s Creed Unity.\n\nOn 15 April 2020, Germany offered to restore ""some of the large clerestory windows located far above eye level"" with three expert tradesmen who specialize in rebuilding cathedrals.Monika Grütters, Germany\'s Commissioner for Culture, was quoted as saying ""her country would shoulder the costs"".\n\nAs of 30 November 2020, all of the tangled scaffolding was removed from the spire area.It is no longer a threat to the building.\n\nOn 15 April 2022, French president Emmanuel Macron visited the cathedral as the country marked the third anniversary of the fire.Macron toured the site where works are being carried out to restore the iconic landmark and spoke to those undertaking the project about their progress so far.\n\nIn the spring of 2022, eight workshops of master glassmakers and locksmiths, selected across France, began the process of cleaning and restoration of the cathedral\'s stained glass windows.The Cologne Cathedral workshop from Germany joined the effort by restoring four of the stained glass windows.\n\nOn 18 August 2023, former high-ranking French general Jean-Louis Georgelin, who oversaw the cathedral\'s reconstruction since 2020, died.\n\nThe cathedral is expected to reopen in December 2024.\n\n, donations of over €1billion had been pledged for the cathedral\'s reconstruction, at least €880million of that in less than a day after Macron\'s appeal.Pledges €10M and over include:\n\nThere have been many additional pledges for smaller, or undisclosed, amounts.A proposal by former minister Jean-Jacques Aillagon that corporate donations for Notre-Dame should get a 90% tax deduction (rather than the standard 60%) was retracted after public outcry.Some donors have said they will not seek tax deductions.Donors exempted of income tax (more than half of French taxpayers, including working- and middle-class) are not eligible for such deductions.\n\n, only €80million had been collected.The minister in charge of national museums and monuments, Franck Riester, predicted that further donations would materialise as reconstruction work progressed, though it was reported that some who made pledges have renounced them because fundraising has been so successful.By September 2021 at least 320,000 donors had contributed over €840 million to the rebuilding effort.\n\nThe current status of the restoration is posted regularly by the organisation the Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris.\n\n1984 York Minster fire 2009 St Mel\'s Cathedral fire 2019 Shuri Castle fire 2024 Børsen fire Construction and renovation fires List of building or structure fires List of destroyed heritage List of fires at major places of worship\n', 'Claim_Context': 'On 17 April, French president Emmanuel Macron set a five-year deadline to restore the cathedral.

other options include rebuilding in the original lead and wood, rebuilding with modern materials not visible from the outside (like the reinforced concrete trusses at Reims Cathedral), or using a combination of restored old elements and newly designed ones.\n\nFrench prime minister Édouard Philippe announced an architectural design competition for a new spire ""adapted to the techniques and the challenges of our era.""The spire replacement project gathered a variety of designs and some controversy, particularly its legal exemption from environmental and heritage rules.After the design competition was announced, the French Senate amended the government\'s proposed restoration bill to require the roof to be restored to how it was before the fire.The National Assembly rejected this amendment, and on 16 July 2019, 95 days after the fire that destroyed the cathedral\'s roof and central spire, the law that governs the restoration of the cathedral was finally approved by the Parliament.It recognises its UNESCO World Heritage Site status and the need to respect existing international charters and practices, to ""preserve the historic, artistic and architectural history of the monument"", and to limit any derogations to the existing heritage, planning, environmental and construction codes to a minimum.It left the architectural form of the reconstruction and the spire design undetermined.\n\nOn 18 April 2019, French game developer and publisher Ubisoft offered to provide the reconstruction effort with over 5,000 hours\' worth of research on the building\'s structure, previously used to recreate the cathedral in the 2014 video game Assassin\'s Creed Unity.\n\nOn 15 April 2020, Germany offered to restore ""some of the large clerestory windows located far above eye level"" with three expert tradesmen who specialize in rebuilding cathedrals.Monika Grütters, Germany\'s Commissioner for Culture, was quoted as saying ""her country would shoulder the costs"".\n\nAs of 30 November 2020, all of the tangled scaffolding was removed from the spire area.It is no longer a threat to the building.\n\nOn 15 April 2022, French president Emmanuel Macron visited the cathedral as the country marked the third anniversary of the fire.Macron toured the site where works are being carried out to restore the iconic landmark and spoke to those undertaking the project about their progress so far.\n\nIn the spring of 2022, eight workshops of master glassmakers and locksmiths, selected across France, began the process of cleaning and restoration of the cathedral\'s stained glass windows.The Cologne Cathedral workshop from Germany joined the effort by restoring four of the stained glass windows.\n\nOn 18 August 2023, former high-ranking French general Jean-Louis Georgelin, who oversaw the cathedral\'s reconstruction since 2020, died.\n\nThe cathedral is expected to reopen in December 2024.\n\n, donations of over €1billion had been pledged for the cathedral\'s reconstruction, at least €880million of that in less than a day after Macron\'s appeal.Pledges €10M and over include:\n\nThere have been many additional pledges for smaller, or undisclosed, amounts.A proposal by former minister Jean-Jacques Aillagon that corporate donations for Notre-Dame should get a 90% tax deduction (rather than the standard 60%) was retracted after public outcry.Some donors have said they will not seek tax deductions.Donors exempted of income tax (more than half of French taxpayers, including working- and middle-class) are not eligible for such deductions.\n\n, only €80million had been collected.The minister in charge of national museums and monuments, Franck Riester, predicted that further donations would materialise as reconstruction work progressed, though it was reported that some who made pledges have renounced them because fundraising has been so successful.By September 2021 at least 320,000 donors had contributed over €840 million to the rebuilding effort.\n\nThe current status of the restoration is posted regularly by the organisation the Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris.\n\n1984 York Minster fire 2009 St Mel\'s Cathedral fire 2019 Shuri Castle fire 2024 Børsen fire Construction and renovation fires List of building or structure fires List of destroyed heritage List of fires at major places of worship\n', 'Claim_Context': 'On 17 April, French president Emmanuel Macron set a five-year deadline to restore the cathedral.

one in Barbados; three in Barbuda; four in the British Virgin Islands; 10 in Cuba; 11 in the French West Indies; one in Haiti; three in Puerto Rico; four on the Dutch side of Sint Maarten; 92 in the contiguous United States, and four in the U.S. Virgin Islands.Hurricane Irma was the top Google searched term in the U.S. and globally in 2017.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa on August 26.The tropical wave moved off the coast of the continent late on August 27.Throughout the next two days, showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low-pressure area, as the system passed just south of and then through the Cape Verde Islands on August 29.Around 00:00 UTC on the following day, the system developed into a tropical depression just west of the Cape Verde Islands.Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Irma, based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates.With warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, strengthening was anticipated, with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier air.\n\nThe nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow, as an anticyclone became established over the system, with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images.Early on August 31, shortly after the development of a central dense overcast (CDO) and an eye feature, Irma underwent rapid intensification, becoming a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 UTC and then a Category 3 hurricane, becoming a major hurricane – around 00:00 UTC on September 1.Within a 48-hour period, the hurricane\'s intensity had increased by .On September 2, a ship passed to the west of the center of Irma, recording maximum winds of , which indicated that the eye of Irma remained compact.A strong high pressure system to the north of Irma caused the storm to move west-southwestward between September 2 and September 4.The first aircraft reconnaissance mission departed from Barbados on the afternoon of September 3, discovering an eye in diameter and surface winds of .\n\nOn September 4, after moving into more favorable conditions, Irma strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane.As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by 12:00 UTC on the following day, with winds of .The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at near 18:00 UTC on September 5. Irma acquired annular characteristics around this time, with the storm exhibiting a large, symmetric CDO and an impressive satellite appearance.Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern Leeward Islands.Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of Barbuda at peak intensity, with the storm\'s central minimum pressure having bottomed out at – this was the lowest in the Atlantic since Dean in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of .Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15 UTC on Sint Maarten, and at 16:30 UTC on Virgin Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands, though the storm\'s central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall.\n\nAs the hurricane moved away from the Virgin Islands late on September 6, observations from reconnaissance flights, as well as Doppler radar in San Juan, Puerto Rico, indicated an elliptical eye and double eyewalls.Late on September 6, the cyclone passed about north of Puerto Rico.Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of Hispaniola throughout the day on September 7.After beginning an eyewall replacement cycle, Irma weakened to a Category 4 hurricane as it passed south of the Turks and Caicos Islands early on September 8.This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category 5 intensity, the second-longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above – behind only the 1932 Cuba hurricane.At 05:00 UTC on September 8, Irma made landfall on the island of Little Inagua in the Bahamas with sustained winds of .The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a subtropical ridge to its north.Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category 5 intensity at 18:00 UTC that day east of Cuba as deep convection became more pronounced and organized.The hurricane then made landfall in Cayo Romano, Cuba, at 03:00 UTC on September 9, with winds of .This made Irma only the second Category 5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the 1924 Cuba hurricane.As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category 2 storm later on September 9.\n\nAfter slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards Florida around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental United States.Moving over the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, Irma quickly restrengthened to a Category 4 hurricane at 06:00 UTC on September 10, as deep convection improved and the eye became better defined.In addition, Irma\'s wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of and gale-force winds spanning in diameter.The cyclone made landfall in Cudjoe Key, Florida, at 13:00 UTC on September 10, at Category 4 intensity, with winds of .Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category 3 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30 UTC, in Marco Island, Florida, with sustained winds of .Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category 3 intensity hours after landfall.Passing east of Tampa as a weakening Category 1 hurricane around 06:00 UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation – though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds.The system finally weakened to a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC that day as it entered southern Georgia, while acquiring some extratropical characteristics.At 06:00 UTC on September 12, Irma degenerated to a remnant low just as it entered Alabama, as most of the deep convection had diminished.The remnants persisted for another day or so before dissipating over Missouri on September 13.\n\nGiven that Irma\'s forecast track was along much of the Caribbean island chain, hurricane warnings were issued for the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and parts of Hispaniola on September 5.\n\nIn Antigua and Barbuda, residents safeguarded their homes and cleaned up their properties in anticipation of strong winds.Emergency crews were put on standby at public shelters and hospitals by September 5 to assist with any evacuations.Expecting a direct hit, more than half of the residents on Barbuda took shelter, and relief supplies were preemptively mobilized.The National Emergency Management Organization on Saint Lucia urged small craft operators and swimmers to be mindful of forecasts for high surf.Small Craft Warnings and High Surf Advisories were hoisted for Dominica, where residents were urged to remain vigilant of the potential for high waves, landslides, and flooding.\n\nIn Guadeloupe, low-lying and cliff-edge homes were evacuated at the threat of flooding and erosion.Schools and public businesses closed on September 5 and 6.Hospitals stocked up on three days\' worth of supplies and checked the functionality of their generators.Of the island\'s 32 communes, 22 activated their emergency plans; 1,500 people were urged to take shelter.The island sustained relatively minor damage and became the base for relief efforts on Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.Though the core of the hurricane was expected to remain north of the island, a yellow alert was issued for Martinique due to the likelihood of rough seas.The island dispatched relief supplies and military reinforcements to its neighboring islands of Guadeloupe, Saint Martin.and Saint Barthélemy, which faced a greater risk of a direct impact.\n\nOn September 4, Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency.By September 6, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency had deployed response teams in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.Supplies, including food rations, medical supplies, and blankets, were pre-staged in strategic locations on the islands for distribution.\n\nOn September 5, the Dominican Republic activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage; the United States and Haiti followed suit two days later.According to officials, 11,200 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas prior to the storm\'s arrival.Approximately 7,400 tourists were moved to Santo Domingo, away from beach resorts.In Haiti, government officials and aid organizations struggled with early preparation and evacuation efforts.While some officials blamed reluctance and indifference on the part of the population, others ""admitted they were not prepared for the onslaught and no mandatory evacuation orders were in place ahead of Irma\'s approach.""Local officials contended that they had not received promised funds, supplies, or equipment from the national government.The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti prepared its 1,000 peacekeepers and engineers to assist.\n\nIn the Turks and Caicos, evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas starting September 5. Schools were closed, government buildings were boarded up, and shelters were opened.Officials spread warnings to residents in English, Creole, and Spanish via social media, radio, SMS text, and WhatsApp.In The Bahamas, the government began preparations the week prior to the hurricane\'s arrival, including securing national sports facilities to use as shelters.By September 7, the government had evacuated 1,609 people by air from the southern islands, including 365 from Bimini.Controlled cutting of the power supply to southern and central Bahamian islands was conducted in advance of the storm.Shelters were made available, though usage was low due to most evacuees staying with family on other islands.Of the 2,679 foreign tourists still in The Bahamas on September 7, about 1,200 were being housed at Atlantis Paradise Island, one of the most hurricane-ready structures in the country.\n\nIn Cuba, meteorologists did not initially predict a direct hit.Fuel conservation was enacted in Camagüey Province to ensure that enough would be available during post-storm power outages.The Civil Defense evacuated nearly one million people from low-lying areas, including thousands of Canadian and European tourists in the Jardines del Rey.Dolphins at a Cayo Guillermo resort were evacuated by helicopter.\n\nThe NHC issued several watches and warnings for the Southeastern United States.The first watches and warnings were issued at 15:00 UTC on September 7, which was a hurricane watch from the Jupiter Inlet to Bonita Beach, including the Florida Keys and Lake Okeechobee.The watches and warnings were extended into Georgia and South Carolina on September 9.At 21:00 UTC on that day, the advisories reached their maximum extent, with a hurricane warning covering the entire east coast of the state, the west coast from Indian Pass southward, and the Florida Keys; a hurricane watch was in place from the Florida–Georgia state line to Edisto Beach, South Carolina; and there were two tropical storm warnings, one in Florida from Indian Pass to the Okaloosa–Walton county line and the other from the Florida–Georgia state line to the South Santee River in South Carolina.Watches and warnings were gradually discontinued as Irma moved inland and weakened, with all of them canceled by early on September 12.\n\nOn September 4, Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency.Governor Scott placed 100 members of the Florida National Guard on duty to assist in preparations.All 7,000 troops were ordered to be on duty by September 8.Officials advised residents to stock their hurricane kits.The state coordinated with electrical companies in order for power outages to be restored as quickly as possible, extending resources such as equipment, fuel, and lodging for the approximately 24,000 restoration personnel who had been activated.Governor Scott suspended tolls on all toll roads in Florida, including the turnpike.All state offices in Florida were closed from September 8 to September 11, while public schools, state colleges, and state universities in all 67 counties were closed during the same period.The Florida Department of Education coordinated with school districts as the need for transportation by school buses and opening shelters arose.By September 9, more than 150 state parks were closed.Throughout the state, almost 700 emergency shelters were opened.The shelters collectively housed about 191,764 people, with more than 40% of them staying in a shelter in South Florida.Additionally, more than 60 special needs shelters were opened, which housed more than 5,000 people by September 9.\n\nMany airports across the state, particularly in Central and South Florida, were closed.Nearly 9,000 flights intending to arrive in or depart from Florida were canceled.Along Florida\'s coasts, most seaports were closed or opened with restricted access.For the fifth time in its 45-year history, the Walt Disney World Resort was completely closed due to the storm.Its theme parks, water parks, and Disney Springs were all closed by 9:00 p.m. on September 9 and remained closed until September 12.Other Orlando-area theme parks, including Universal Orlando Resort and SeaWorld Orlando, were also closed.The Kennedy Space Center was closed from September 8 to September 15.\n\nAn estimated 6.5 million Floridians were ordered to evacuate, mostly those living on barrier islands or in coastal areas; in mobile or sub-standard homes; and in low-lying or flood prone areas.Mandatory evacuations were ordered for portions of Brevard, Broward, Citrus, Collier, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Glades, Hendry, Hernando, Indian River, Lee, Martin, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Lucie, Sumter, and Volusia counties.All of Monroe County, where the Florida Keys are located, was placed under a mandatory evacuation.Residents in communities near the southern half of Lake Okeechobee were also ordered to leave.Additionally, voluntary evacuation notices were issued for all or parts of Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Charlotte, Columbia, Desoto, Hardee, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lake, Manatee, Okeechobee, Osceola, and Polk counties.\n\nA record 6.5 million Floridians evacuated, making it the largest evacuation in the state\'s history.Evacuees caused significant traffic congestion on northbound Interstate 95, Interstate 75, and Florida\'s Turnpike, exacerbated by the fact that the entire Florida peninsula was within the cone of uncertainty in the NHC\'s forecast path in the days before the storm, so evacuees from both coasts headed north, as evacuees would not be safer by fleeing to the opposite coast.Fuel was in short supply throughout peninsular Florida during the week before Irma\'s arrival, especially along evacuation routes, leading to hours-long lines at fuel stations and even escorts of fuel trucks by the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nUse of the left shoulder as a lane for moving traffic was allowed on northbound Interstate 75 from Wildwood to the Georgia state line beginning September 8 and on eastbound Interstate 4 from Tampa to State Road 429 near Celebration for a few hours on September 9.It was the first time that the shoulder-use plan, which was introduced at the start of the 2017 hurricane season, was implemented by the state for hurricane evacuations.The shoulder-use plan was implemented in place of labor- and resource-intensive contraflow lane reversal, in which both sides of an interstate highway are used for one direction of traffic.\n\nOfficials from the Environmental Protection Agency, which had been criticized for its response to Hurricane Harvey, took special measures to inspect and secure hazardous materials, especially at Superfund sites.Direct Relief, a disaster relief organization, coordinated with local health centers and provided resources to help facilities on the front lines of Floridian and Puerto Rican communities.\n\nGeorgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency initially for all six coastal counties on September 6, but eventually expanded the declaration to 94 counties south of Atlanta metropolitan area, and then the entire state on September 10.Atlanta was placed under its first-ever tropical storm warning.Governor Deal ordered mandatory evacuations for all areas east of Interstate 95 on September 7, before extending the order to the entirety of Chatham County and low-lying areas west of I-95 on the following day.In total, 540,000 people on the Georgia coast were ordered to leave.Contraflow lane reversal for Interstate 16 took effect on the morning of September 9 from Savannah to Dublin, Georgia.All Georgia state parks were open for free to evacuees, as was the 800-acre camping area at Atlanta Motor Speedway.Reversible HOT lanes on Interstate 75 in Georgia through south metro Atlanta were open 24 hours northbound with no tolls.\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on September 6, with South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster following suit the same day.Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency on September 8 in order to protect Virginia residents and to mobilize resources in support of neighboring states.Officials in New Orleans stated that there would not be much time for preparations if Irma failed to make the projected northward turn, but that South Texas or Florida would not be a good evacuation destination.On September 10, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam issued an executive order allowing medical professionals in other states to practice in Tennessee to aid Hurricane Irma evacuees.This order also allowed pharmacies to give out 14-day supplies of medicine, and gave women and children from outside the state the ability to participate in the Tennessee Department of Health programs.Bristol Motor Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway, and Charlotte Motor Speedway all opened their campgrounds to evacuees free of charge.\n\nIn professional sports, the Miami Dolphins–Tampa Bay Buccaneers game scheduled for September 10 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was postponed to November 19 due to the storm\'s threat.The Dolphins left early for their road game against the Los Angeles Chargers.The Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees moved their September 11–13 series from Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg to Citi Field in Queens.Minor League Baseball\'s Florida State League, Carolina League, and Southern League called off their championship finals and as a result, named their division series winners league co-champions.The Miami FC versus San Francisco Deltas match on September 10 was cancelled so the players and staff could prepare for the storm with their families.The Orlando Pride of the National Women\'s Soccer League rescheduled their September 9 match to September 7. Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer did not have any scheduled home games in September, but was unable to return to training facilities in Orlando due to Hurricane Irma.\n\nIn college football, the UCF Knights-Memphis Tigers game scheduled for September 9 was moved to September 30, replacing UCF\'s game against Maine and Memphis game against Georgia State.UCF also cancelled their game against Georgia Tech on September 16, as UCF\'s stadium hosted the National Guard.The USF Bulls-Connecticut Huskies football game was also cancelled.The Miami Hurricanes–Arkansas State Redwolves game scheduled for September 9 at Centennial Bank Stadium in Arkansas was canceled due to travel concerns for the University of Miami.The Florida Gators-Northern Colorado Bears match in Gainesville scheduled for September 9 was cancelled.The Florida State Seminoles contest against the Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks was canceled on September 8.The Seminoles\' rivalry game with the Hurricanes in Tallahassee, originally scheduled for September 16, was postponed tp October 7.The FIU Panthers game against the Alcorn State Braves was moved up a day and relocated to Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.The Georgia Southern Eagles game against the New Hampshire Wildcats on September 9 was also moved to Legion Field for that day.\n\nAs of September 5, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding was running dangerously low, due to its response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas the previous week, prompting the Trump administration to request an immediate $8 billion in additional funding as Irma approached Florida.Given the rate that current funds are being consumed and the catastrophic damage, the United States Senate almost doubled the requested amount to $15.3 billion, with the understanding that this would only be about 10% of what will be required for responding to Harvey.\n\nHurricane Irma\'s path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating, with landfalls in Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Martin, the Bahamas, Cuba, and the United States, all at major hurricane intensity.Furthermore, the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences.Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria.\n\nThe eyewall of the hurricane moved over Barbuda near its record peak intensity early on September 6; a weather station observed a wind gust of .The same station also recorded a minimum barometric pressure of .The exact state of the island remained unclear for hours after Irma\'s passage, as downed phone lines ceased all communication with nearby islands.Later that afternoon, Prime Minister Gaston Browne surveyed the territory by helicopter, revealing an effectively uninhabitable island.Irma damaged or destroyed 95% of the structures on Barbuda, including its hospital, schools, and both of its hotels; it completely flattened some residential blocks while submerging others.The destruction rendered the island\'s sole airport and much of its infrastructure inoperative—including water and telecommunication services—which further hampered relief efforts.Property damage on Barbuda ranged from $150 million to $300 million.A total of three storm-related deaths were reported on the island.\n\nIn addition to the catastrophic impact on Barbuda\'s human residents, concern turned to the storm\'s effects on the island\'s wildlife.The island\'s only endemic bird, the near-threatened Barbuda warbler, numbered less than 2,000 individuals prior to the hurricane.For some time it was unknown if the warbler survived the hurricane or its aftermath; however within a few months it was confirmed that not only did the species survive, but the most of the birds survived the storm.Barbuda\'s Codrington Lagoon, home to the largest colony of magnificent frigatebirds in the Caribbean, with an estimated 2,500 nesting pairs, was also inundated by the storm surge.\n\nRemaining just outside of Irma\'s strongest windfield, Antigua sustained less severe damage, in the form of leveled roofs and fences, downed power poles and lines, and uprooted trees.Some street flooding also took place in low-lying areas.Three people were treated for minor storm-related injuries.Forensic disaster analysts from the Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM), a Germany-based risk management agency, estimate that economic losses for Antigua and Barbuda will exceed $120 million.\n\nOn the morning of September 6, Irma\'s center crossed the island of Saint Martin while the storm was at peak intensity, sweeping away entire structures, submerging roads and cars, and triggering an island-wide blackout.Irma\'s extreme winds ripped trees out of the ground and sent vehicles and debris from damaged structures scattered across the territory.On the French side of Saint-Martin, entire marinas around Marigot were left in ruins, littered with the stranded remnants of boats that had smashed into each other.A hotel caught on fire, but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze.Another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor.Media images depicted devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds had shattered their windows.Irma killed four people on the French side of the island and injured 50 others, one of whom was in critical condition.As many as 95% of the buildings there were damaged to some degree; 60% of those were totally uninhabitable.Estimates from CEDIM indicate a minimum of $950 million worth of economic losses.Total losses exceeded €3.5 billion (US$4.17 billion).\n\nA similar situation unfolded in Sint Maarten, Saint Martin\'s Dutch half, as intense winds ripped through buildings and lifted vehicles aloft ""as if they were matches"".The hurricane wreaked havoc on Princess Juliana International Airport, with ""huge chunks of the building [strewn] across the runway and a jet bridge snapped in half.""It demolished or severely damaged about 70% of Sint Maarten\'s houses, forcing thousands of residents into public shelters.There were 4 deaths and 23 injuries, 11 of which were serious, in the Dutch territory.Irma is considered the worst natural disaster to hit Sint Maarten; the extent of its damage far exceeded that of any previous hurricane.Total damages were estimated at €2.5 billion (US$2.98 billion).\n\nIrma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the French island of Saint Barthélemy, southeast of Saint Martin.Describing the extent of the destruction, one local compared it to ""a bomb that burned all vegetation,"" while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively ""erased the island from the map"".Violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments, with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation.Streets in the capital of Gustavia were turned into rushing rivers, which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture.The island\'s fire station was inundated with up to of flood waters.With scores of homes and much of the infrastructure destroyed, the majority of the island\'s population was left stranded and without water, electricity or phone service.The associated economic losses could exceed $480 million according to CEDIM\'s analysts.\n\nPreliminary assessments from the French government indicate that Hurricane Irma caused a combined €1.2 billion (US$1.43 billion) in insured losses across the French territories of Saint-Martin and Saint Barts.This total covered private property such as homes, vehicles and businesses (including lost revenue); the extent of the damage to infrastructural and public facilities remains undetermined.Nonetheless, this made Irma one of the costliest natural disasters to hit the French Republic in 50 years.\n\nOn January 30, 2018, roughly five months after Irma, an analysis was published indicating that an anemometer on the island recorded an unofficial gust to before failing.\n\nThe British Overseas Territory of Anguilla saw the eyewall of the storm pass over it on September 6.Many homes and schools were destroyed, and the island\'s only hospital was badly damaged.The devastation was particularly severe in East End, where the winds uprooted scores of trees and power poles and demolished a number of houses.In The Valley, the island\'s capital, the hurricane blew out the windows of government buildings.Rough seas inflicted heavy damage upon several bays and harbors, and a seaside restaurant was completely eradicated.About 90% of roads were left impassable.The island\'s air traffic control tower was damaged, exacerbating the already poor communication with the island.One death was reported on the island.Estimates of losses on the island total at least $190 million.\n\nLarge swells ahead of Irma washed ashore debris and sea life in Castries, Saint Lucia, blocking some roads.Seaside roads were inundated with water.One surfer was killed amid rough surf in Barbados after hitting a reef and breaking his neck.Trees were also destroyed.The hurricane\'s effects, such as violent seas and rattling trees, were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in Guadeloupe.Several houses were damaged.Around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm, leaving several communes in the dark without running water.Overall damage was limited to external parts of houses and trees that were blown onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seas.\n\nSaint Kitts and Nevis endured similar conditions to other islands.Blustery rainstorms triggered scattered power outages and disabled the island\'s water system, but per the International Red Cross, the islands were spared the level of destruction seen elsewhere.Still, Prime Minister Timothy Harris stated that property and infrastructure had sustained ""significant damage.""The Dutch territories of Saba and Sint Eustatius were also struck by the hurricane\'s winds, resulting in infrastructural damage, water shortages and telecommunication outages.Several houses were left uninhabitable.On Saba, the hurricane also defoliated trees and injured a few people.CEDIM\'s analysts expect economic losses of $20–65 million for the two islands.\n\nDamage in the British Virgin Islands was extensive.Numerous buildings and roads were destroyed on the island of Tortola, which bore the brunt of the hurricane\'s core.Four people were confirmed dead.Along Cane Garden Bay, the storm surge submerged several seaside bars and a gas station.Satellite images revealed many of the island\'s residential zones had been left in ruins.The hurricane passed over Necker Island, also causing severe damage and destroying the mansion of Richard Branson.\n\nMost homes and businesses were destroyed on the island of Jost Van Dyke, the smallest of the B.V.I.\'s four main islands.The Governor, Gus Jaspert, who had only been sworn into office 13 days previously, declared a state of emergency - the first time this has ever happened in the Territory.After the storm, restoration of electricity took approximately 5 months.\n\nIrma\'s effects in the U.S. Virgin Islands were most profound on Saint Thomas, where at least of rain fell, and on Saint John.Saint Thomas island suffered widespread structural damage, including to its police station and airport.Patients from the fourth and third floors of Charlotte Amalie\'s hospital had to be relocated to lower floors due to flooding from roof leaks.Three deaths were attributed to Irma on the island.On nearby Saint Croix, there were communication issues and some damage to the infrastructure.Saint John lost access to ferry and cargo services, along with access to the local airport.Due to its normal reliance on electricity from Saint Thomas, the island was left without power.Total damage from the three islands was at least $1.1 billion.\n\nThe hurricane passed north of Puerto Rico, but still caused significant damage to the United States territory.Along the coast, a tide gauge observed waves up to mean higher high water.Much of the main island experienced sustained tropical storm force winds, with a peak sustained wind speed of at a weather station along San Juan Bay, while the same site observed a peak wind gust of .However, on the island of Culebra, a wind gust of was reported.Mainly due to strong winds, approximately 1.1 million out of 1.5 million of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority\'s customers lost electricity.Portions of Puerto Rico received heavy rainfall, with a peak total of in Bayamón, causing seven rivers to reach flood stage, widespread flash flooding, and at least six landslides.\n\nThe most severely affected areas included the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques, as well as the northeastern, northern, and mountainous portions of the main island.On Culebra, the island suffered an almost complete loss of electrical and water services.At least 30 homes on the island were destroyed, while about 30 other experienced substantial damage.High winds also toppled a number of trees.The only telecommunications tower on Culebra sustained damage, cutting off outside communications for several hours.In rural Loíza, 79 homes were destroyed.Throughout Puerto Rico, 781 out of 1,600 telecommunications towers went out of commission, primarily due to power outages.At least 362,000 customers lost water services.Debris, mostly fallen trees, blocked at least 72 roads.Approximately 25% to 30% of banana, coffee, papaya, and plantain crops were damaged by strong winds, with losses to farmers estimated at $30.6 million.Approximately 1,530 homes experienced at least moderate damage, with 1,448 homes moderately damaged, 32 extensively damaged, and 50 completely destroyed.\n\nHurricane Irma was attributed to around $1 billion in damage, and the NHC attributed three fatalities to Irma in Puerto Rico, though four deaths were related to the storm.Two people died due to rainstorms ahead of the hurricane: one man died in Orocovis after falling off his ladder while repairing his roof; another man on the coast in Capitanejo died after being struck by lightning.Three nearby fishermen were burned by the same lightning strike, but survived.Two other people died during the hurricane: a woman died while being evacuated from her house in a wheelchair and fell, hitting her head; another person died in a car accident in Canóvanas.Governor Ricardo Rosselló declared the islands of Culebra and Vieques to be disaster areas.\n\nAlthough spared a direct hit, both the Dominican Republic and Haiti were affected by high winds and heavy rains.A bridge over the Dajabón River connecting the two countries was broken.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, the fishing community of Nagua sustained damage from waves that destroyed homes.55,000 soldiers were deployed to affected areas to help with the clean-up efforts.By the evening of September 7, the government had counted 2,721 damaged homes.\n\nIn Haiti, flooding one meter deep sat in residential neighborhoods in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives.Mudslides, destroyed homes, flooded crops, and infrastructure damage were reported in the northern part of the country.The total expanse of the flooding stretched from Môle-Saint-Nicolas in the west to the eastern border with the Dominican Republic.\n\nOn the evening of September 7, at 7:30 pm AST (23:30 UTC), Hurricane Irma reached the Turks and Caicos Islands.While the eye passed just south of the main islands, crossing over South Caicos and the Ambergris Cays, the most powerful winds on the northern side of the eye swept all of the islands for more than two hours.Communications infrastructure was destroyed.\n\nOn September 8, Minister of Infrastructure Goldray Ewing confirmed that damage to Providenciales was extensive, with the northwestern neighborhood of Blue Hill being ""gone"".The hospital in the capital, Cockburn Town, was heavily damaged.On South Caicos, 75% of roofs were lost.Total damage was estimated at over $500 million.\n\nIn the Bahamas, the eye of the storm passed over Duncan Town, the major settlement of the Ragged Islands chain, on September 8.It also passed ""almost directly over"" Inagua and South Acklins, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.\n\nDamages were largely confined to the southern islands starting the morning of September 8.On Mayaguana and Great Inagua, downed power lines knocked out communications.On Great Inagua, 70% of homes sustained roof damage, and the island\'s school lost its roof entirely.The Morton Salt Company\'s signature production facility, one of the major employers in the country, experienced millions of dollars in damages.The Acklins settlement of Salina Point was cut off from the rest of the island by flooding, while Crooked Island had widespread roof damage.In the northern Bahamas, the worst property damage came on September 10 as the outer bands of the system produced tornadic activity on Grand Bahama and Bimini.Damage and losses across The Bahamas amounted to $135 million.\n\nWhile Irma was making landfall in Florida, the ocean was drawn away from some western shorelines of the Bahamas due to strong easterly winds.\n\nEarly on September 9, Irma made landfall on the Camagüey Archipelago off the northern coast of Cuba, with sustained winds of .The strongest official sustained wind speed was , while the highest wind gust reached ; both were observed near Camila in Ciego de Ávila Province.The weather station at Esmeralda, Camagüey, was damaged, with the wind gauge destroyed.The north coast of Cuba experienced significant coastal flooding due to storm surge and abnormally high tides generated by the storm.Wave heights at Cayo Romano exceeded .Storm surge penetrated as far as inland in some areas of Villa Clara Province.Multiple locations on the island observed at least of rainfall, with a peak total of of precipitation at Topes de Collantes.\n\nA total of 158,554 homes experienced some degree of damage, of which 14,657 were destroyed; approximately 1.9 million people experienced the direct effects of Irma.The storm partially deroofed 103,691 homes, while 23,560 were completely deroofed.Irma damaged or destroyed 980 health facilities and 2,264 schools.Approximately 3.1 million people experienced disruptions to the water supply, while 246,707 people lost telephone service.About of roads were damaged.Crops also suffered extensively, with nearly affected by the storm.Throughout the country, the hurricane inflicted $13.185 billion in damage and killed 10 people, making Irma the costliest tropical cyclone in Cuban history.\n\nThe tourist areas of Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and Cayo Santa María and the nearby town of Caibarién received the brunt of the storm, with waves rolling through town and the characteristic one-story homes completely flooded.The storm most severely Ciego de Ávila and Villa Clara provinces.Flooding worsened as the hurricane moved west, pushing the storm surge along to the regions around Havana.By the afternoon, limited flooding was occurring in Havana, including around the Malecón.Portions of province coastal flooding surpassing that which was experienced during the Storm of the Century in 1993 and Hurricane Wilma in 2005.In the city of Santa Clara, 39 buildings collapsed.Rainfall resulted in several rivers reaching major flood stage.The town of Cabaiguán in Sancti Spíritus Province in particular suffered extensive inland flooding after the Zaza River swelled.\n\nHurricane Irma directly affected a major colony of American flamingos on Cuba\'s northern Cayo Coco.Early reports from Diario de Cuba indicated that several hundred flamingos had been killed by the storm, though other estimates ranged as high as several thousand birds.\n\nHurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida.Except for the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned.Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba, but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys.The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States.After surveying the aftermath of Irma, Florida governor Rick Scott said ""I thought we would see more damage""[on the mainland] but said ""he witnessed devastation in the Keys"".President Donald Trump commented on Twitter that the devastation in some places was ""far greater than anyone thought"".\n\nDamage in the United States was estimated at a minimum of $50 billion.At the time, Irma was the fourth costliest tropical cyclone in the United States, behind hurricanes Sandy in 2012, Harvey earlier that year, and Katrina in 2005.However, later in September 2017, Hurricane Maria became the third costliest United States tropical cyclone, causing Irma to fall to the fifth costliest.At least 92 people, 10 directly and 82 indirectly, died throughout the United States in relation to Irma: 84 in Florida, 3 in Georgia, 3 in South Carolina, and 2 in North Carolina.\n\nIrma struck the state less than two weeks after Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten had caused the worst flooding seen in western Florida in 20 years, which further worsened the impacts in the region.The storm\'s large wind field resulted in strong winds across much of Florida, except for the western Panhandle.The highest reported sustained wind speed was on Marco Island, while the strongest observed wind gust was , recorded near Naples, though wind gusts of likely occurred in the Middle Florida Keys.More than 7.7 million homes and businesses in Florida were left without electricity at some point – approximately 73% of state.Generally heavy amounts of rainfall were recorded to the east of the Irma\'s path, including a peak total of in Fort Pierce.Heavy precipitation – and storm surge, in some instances – overflowed at least 32 rivers and creeks, causing significant flooding, particularly along the St. Johns River and its tributaries.Many homes and businesses suffered damage or destruction, with more than 65,000 structures damaged to some degree in West Central and Southwest Florida alone.Agriculture experienced about $2.5 billion in damage.It was estimated that the cyclone caused at least $50 billion in damage, making Irma the costliest hurricane in Florida history, surpassing Hurricane Andrew, until it was itself surpassed by Hurricane Ian, 5 years later.\n\nThroughout Florida, at least 84 people died in storm-related incidents.About half of the deaths occurred from drowning, trauma, and carbon monoxide poisoning.Broward County had 21 fatalities, the most of any county in Florida.Among those deaths were 12 people at The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, a Hollywood nursing home.The patients died from sweltering heat worsened by the lack of air conditioning.The hurricane also left at least 14 deaths in Monroe County; 6 deaths in Orange County; 5 deaths each in Duval, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties; 4 deaths in both Highlands and Hillsborough counties; 3 deaths in both Marion and Polk counties; 2 deaths each in Collier, Hardee, Leon, Pinellas, St. Lucie, and Taylor counties; and 1 death in Hendry, Lake, Lee, Liberty, Manatee, Nassau, Okeechobee, Pasco, Seminole, St. Johns, and Volusia counties.\n\nWith Irma making landfall in Monroe County as a Category 4 hurricane, the Florida Keys were hardest hit area in the state.Strong winds and storm surge flooding caused major damage to buildings, trailer parks, boats, roads, the electricity supply, mobile phone coverage, internet access, sanitation, the water supply and the fuel supply throughout the island chain.An estimated storm surge occurred at Cudjoe Key, where Irma made landfall.Throughout the island, 625 homes sustained minor damage, 52 sustained major damage, and 81 were demolished.On Big Pine Key, one of the most devastated islands, 633 homes received minor impact, 299 homes received major impact, and 473 homes were completely destroyed.Overall in Monroe County, 27,649 homes experienced some degree of damage, including 1,179 homes being destroyed, 2,977 homes receiving major damage, and 5,361 suffering minor damage.\n\nAfter devastating the Keys, the storm then struck Collier County as a Category 3 hurricane.Several communities in the county suffered extensive damage, especially along the coast.Throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, 65 homes, including 44 mobile homes, were demolished, while 1,008 homes received major damage.Property damages in unincorporated areas alone reach about $320 million.Lee County was lashed by strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused prolonged flooding in some areas.More than 24,000 homes suffered some degree of damage, with almost 3,000 homes receiving major damage and 89 homes being destroyed.Damage in the county totaled about $857 million.\n\nImpact in much of the Miami metropolitan area was generally limited to extensive tree and fence damage, as well as widespread power outages.However, in Miami-Dade County, about 1,000 homes received major damage and about 50% of crops were lost.Storm surge caused coastal flooding from Homestead to Downtown Miami, as well as in portions of Miami Beach.Parts of the Florida Heartland were devastated by high winds and flooding, particularly Hendry and Highlands counties.In the former, which has most citrus trees of any county in Florida, about 60% of orange crops were lost.Throughout Hendry County, a total of 451 homes had minor damage, 131 homes suffered major damage, and 42 others were destroyed.In Highlands County, 13,138 businesses and homes were damaged to some degree, with 144 being destroyed, 963 sustaining major damage, and 2,408 receiving minor damage.In Orange County, wind gusts reached 79 mph at Orlando International Airport.A wind gust of 91 mph was also recorded in Orlando at the top of the Disney Contemporary Resort.Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central Florida left some wind damage and flooding, necessitating evacuations and rescues, including more than 200 people in Orlo Vista after hundreds of homes were flooded.A total of 2,999 business or homes were damaged in Lake County, 7,430 in Seminole County, and 3,457 in Volusia County.Additionally, eight tornadoes touched down in Brevard County, all of which caused damage.\n\nAlong much of the Gulf Coast of Florida, to the north of where Irma made landfall, negative storm surges were observed, with water retracting rather than pushing inland, causing little coastal flooding.However, on the opposite coast, extensive erosion and storm surge flooding occurred in the First Coast, especially in Duval and St. Johns counties.In Duval County, the St. Johns River crested at heights that exceeded records set during Hurricane Dora in 1964.Portions of Jacksonville experienced flooding, particularly the downtown area and the Riverside and San Marco neighborhoods, with about 350 people rescued in those sections of the city.Water reached about high in some homes.The city of Jacksonville suffered about $85 million in damage.\n\nIn St. Johns County, storm surge left extensive damage to oceanfront properties in Ponte Vedra Beach and Vilano Beach, with several becoming uninhabitable.Additionally, some riverfront businesses in St. Augustine\'s historic district were flooded due to storm surge from the Matanzas River.In nearby Clay County, rainfall and storm surge combined to cause extensive flooding along portions of the Black Creek and the St. Johns River, with record high crests at several locations along the former.About 350 people and 75 animals were rescued from floodwaters throughout the county.A total of 275 homes were destroyed, 175 were inflicted major damage, and 124 received minor damage.\n\nThree deaths were reported in Georgia due to falling trees and debris, along with widespread wind damage and power outages throughout the state primarily due to fallen trees.On Tybee Island, as well as St. Simons Island the storm surge caused extensive flooding.The tropical storm also did $54 million in damage in the state.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the third highest storm surge on record was recorded, reaching a height of approximately .By of September 12, almost 100,000 had lost power in Upstate South Carolina.Five people died in storm-related incidents across South Carolina, all from indirect incidents.The tropical storm caused damages totaling $500,000 in the state.\n\nLight damage occurred in other areas, including Tennessee.About 75,000 customers in North Carolina lost power due to Irma.It also caused $600,000 in damages in Alabama.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Irma\'s path through the West Indies and Caribbean, the devastation to roads, harbors and airports significantly impeded the transportation and distribution of relief supplies.Foreign countries moved to provide much of the initial aid.The British, Dutch, French, and United States governments sent warships and planes with supplies and manpower to the region.International leaders, including Dutch King Willem-Alexander and French President Emmanuel Macron, quickly moved to visit affected territories.\n\nSome of the affected countries and territories also offered assistance to each other.Cuba, which sustained extensive damage from the storm, sent 750 health workers to Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, Dominica, and Haiti.Government officials and members of the public in Puerto Rico delivered assistance and evacuated people stranded on other islands.The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services granted special 30-day humanitarian visas for British Virgin Islanders to stay in Puerto Rico.Hundreds of people stranded on Saint Martin were flown to the Dominican Republic on humanitarian grounds.\n\nIn response to Hurricane Jose\'s approach, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a mandatory evacuation on September 9 for any remaining residents on Barbuda.A Miami cargo plane landed on Antigua later that day, carrying over 60 tons (120,000 lbs) of relief supplies for the displaced storm victims—including bottled water, canned food and power generators.\n\nRFA Mounts Bay stationed itself near Anguilla and provided support and relief work to the island with its helicopters and 40 marines and army engineers.The ship delivered 6 tonnes of emergency aid to Anguilla and army engineers repaired a fuel leak at Anguilla\'s main petrol dump, restored power to the island\'s hospital and provided shelters for those left homeless by the hurricane.The ship arrived in the British Virgin Islands on September 8, 2017, to provide emergency relief to the islands, including providing shelters, food and water.HMS Ocean was diverted from the Mediterranean to provide relief from Gibraltar to the affected British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos on September 7, and aid was also supplied by the Department for International Development from their disaster response centre at Kemble Airfield.As part of a £32 million operation named Operation Ruman, nearly 500 UK military personnel with emergency relief were dispatched from RAF Brize Norton.This included the first deployment of No. 38 Expeditionary Air Wing with 3 RAF aircraft; 2 Airbus A400M Atlas and 1 C130J hercules to support relief efforts.\n\nThe British government also drafted 2 members of the UK police calibre into the region on September 10, and 53 police officers were drafted from RAF Brize Norton to the affected British Overseas Territories on September 15 to help maintain order.UK politicians, including the chairs of the foreign affairs and development select committees, criticized both the government\'s preparations for the storm and its response as inadequate.\n\nBy September 12, the Department for International Development had delivered more than 40 tonnes of aid into the region, including into Turks and Caicos, and 1,000 UK military troops were deployed in the region as part of relief efforts.The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, pledged an additional £25 million worth of funding as part of relief efforts in the region on September 13, 2017, and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Boris Johnson, said that a further 250 UK military personnel would be deployed into the area within the next few days.Anguilla\'s Chief Minister, Victor Banks, praised the British government\'s response to the storm and said that Boris Johnson\'s visit to the island ""sends a very positive signal to Anguillans that the British are serious about their response to this very severe hurricane"", but went on to say that the current financial commitment from the UK was not substantial enough.\n\nBy September 15, the United Kingdom had over 70 military personnel and 4 police officers in Anguilla and had delivered 15 tonnes of aid to the island.In the British Virgin Islands, Royal Marines had cleared the airfield so that it was operational for the delivery of aid into the islands, with more than 200 British military personnel and 54 UK police officers on the ground and 8 tonnes of aid delivered to the islands.120 British military personnel were on the ground in Turks and Caicos, and over 150 shelter kits and 720 liters of water were delivered to the islands on September 15.\n\nAmendments to international aid rules by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (or OECD) allowed for the UK government to provide access to £13 billion worth of aid to the affected British Overseas Territories, through the UK\'s Official Development Assistance (ODA) by November 2017.\n\nBy the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage.The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by Irma\'s eye, remained largely inaccessible for days.Assessments showed that 15% of the national telecommunications network had been affected, with at least one tower destroyed.Bahamasair resumed a limited domestic schedule on September 10, with international flights still cancelled due to existing and anticipated destruction at other destinations.\n\nThe worst devastation occurred on Ragged Island, over which Irma\'s eye had directly passed.After days of the National Emergency Management Agency not being able to physically reach the island, officials were finally able to inspect it; they promptly declared it uninhabitable.Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said that it was the worst disaster area he or his officials had ever seen, and that all remaining residents would need to leave, potentially permanently.Business leaders and other officials called for a new long-term development model to shift the population away from such sparsely-settled islands.\n\nOn Grand Bahama and Bimini, where tornadoes associated with Irma touched down on September 10, more than 100 people were left displaced.Infrastructure damage included docks, parks, and the power system.\n\nAside from tangible asset losses, Irma brought significant economic damages.International freight shipping was projected to be offline for a week, and costs for rebuilding supplies were inflated due to demand in the U.S.\n\nSwollen rivers contributed to worsening flooding in the days after the storm system left, resulting in additional evacuations.Officials resorted to using inflatable rafts to access affected areas.The national electrical infrastructure was said to be extensively damaged.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, flooding worsened following Irma\'s departure, leading the number of displaced persons to increase to more than 24,000 by September 8.President Danilo Medina ordered further evacuations due to at-risk dams, while the government banned swimming in rivers and ordered boats kept in port.More than 422,000 people were left without water due to 28 aqueducts being damaged.\n\nIn Haiti, officials stated that losses were greater than they could have been since people largely did not heed early preparation and evacuation warnings.At least 5,000 homes were flooded.One man died trying to cross a flooded river; another went missing and 17 were injured.The trash- and waste-contaminated floodwaters in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives led to fears of cholera outbreaks.Flooding continued to worsen days after the storm, as runoff from the mountains swelled rivers in low-lying farming communities.United Nations peacekeepers from Brazil were able to gain access to the flooded northwest region to provide urgent aid, but non-governmental organizations and Haitian economists warned that the estimated 30,000 victims would need longer-term assistance as well.Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant appointed a government commission to address Irma\'s effects, with Action Against Hunger in charge of humanitarian coordination.\n\nIn the USVI, residents and tourists alike were described as being in a state of traumatic shock.By September 7, the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship had arrived in the USVI to provide supplies, damage assessment, and evacuation assistance.Four additional warships, some of which had already been on their way to Texas to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief, were redirected to the region.At a September 10 news conference, Governor Kenneth Mapp described Irma as a ""horrific disaster"" for which ""[t]here will be no restorations or solutions in days or weeks.""The Federal Emergency Management Agency airlifted in goods for residents, who were subjected to a curfew.Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line agreed to transport tourists to Florida, contingent upon port availability following the state\'s own experience with Irma.\n\nOn Saint John, described as ""perhaps the site of Irma\'s worst devastation on American soil,"" it took six days for an active-theater disaster zone to be established, leading to criticism of the U.S. government response.The National Guard was delayed in reaching Saint John due to the number of overturned boats left in the harbor.The National Guard was brought in to maintain order, while the Coast Guard brought evacuees to cruise ships bound for San Juan and Miami.There was still no electricity on St. John in the middle of October 2017.\n\nBy September 9, more than one million Puerto Ricans were still without power, tens of thousands were without water, and several thousand were still in shelters.Hospitals were operating on generator power.The government was struggling to establish contact with the islands of Culebra and Vieques.By September 10, the main island had recovered enough to serve as a refuge for people stranded on other islands, including 1,200 tourists from Saint Martin and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Airlifts had brought more than 50 patients to Puerto Rico.\n\nFive months after Irma, two-thirds of the hospital beds on Saint Thomas were still unavailable, due to extensive physical damage and staffing shortages.\n\nDamage to Sint Maarten\'s harbour and to Princess Juliana International Airport left the Dutch part of Saint Martin unreachable, although the smaller Grand Case-Espérance Airport on the French side could be reopened by September 7 for supply aid by helicopter and airplane.The French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops on board a CASA/IPTN CN-235 aircraft.\n\nThe following day, the Dutch military was able to airlift dialysis patients off the island while also dropping leaflets to warn islanders about the rapidly approaching Hurricane Jose.Although the airport was closed, 435 students and faculty of the American University of the Caribbean were evacuated by the U.S. military.On September 10, Dutch King Willem-Alexander departed for the region, with intentions to visit Sint Maarten and other affected Dutch territories and commonwealth members.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron followed this announcement by stating his intentions to visit the French part of the island on September 12 in order to bring aid supplies.In response to criticism of the French handling of the disaster, 1,000 troops, police, and other emergency workers were sent to Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.\n\nOn both sides of Saint Martin, desperate conditions combined with food and water shortages in Irma\'s aftermath led to reports of violence, scavenging, and theft.In response, the French government increased its troop deployment to 2,200 and the Dutch government sent more than 600 military and police personnel.\n\nThe day after the hurricane hit Saint Barthelemy the French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops into the reopened Grand Case-Espérance Airport.On September 7 and 9, equipment and personnel were flown from France to Guadeloupe and Martinique.\n\nSporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm.\n\nOn September 11, Florida Governor Rick Scott conducted an aerial tour to survey the damage to the Keys.The Overseas Highway remained closed while authorities assessed the integrity of the 42 bridges along the route.Residents returning to the Keys were faced with a police roadblock, to the south of Florida City.USS Iwo Jima, USS New York and aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were sent to the Keys area to aid with the recovery.\n\nOn September 12, some residents were allowed to return into the Keys as far as Islamorada.Although road damage blocked entry any farther than Islamorada, bridges had been inspected and found safe to Sugarloaf Key.By late on September 12, the Overseas Highway had been repaired and the bridges inspected as safe for first responders to travel to Key West.On September 16, residents were free to return to Marathon.Residents were allowed to return to Key West the following day, although the Keys remained closed to tourists and a checkpoint remained in place in Florida City.\n\nDue mainly to the widespread loss of power, cell phone service was also reduced after battery backup power for cell phone towers ran out and backup generators ran out of fuel.In an impact report by the FCC, as of 11 AM EDT on September 12, 89 of 108 (82%) cell phone towers were non-functioning in Monroe County (Florida Keys), 154 of 212 (73%) were non-functioning in Collier County (Naples), 36 of 46 (78%) were non-functioning in Hendry County, and an additional six counties had 41-60% of cell phone towers not functioning, including Lee County (Fort Myers) and Miami-Dade County.\n\nNOAA released map-format aerial reconnaissance image data of damage from the storm.The imagery featured several areas of Florida: including the Florida Keys, the southwest coast of Florida from Marco Island to Punta Gorda, much of the northeast coast of Florida, and portions of the Jacksonville area.Portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts were also photographed.Additionally, the Sun-Sentinel published before and after photos of several landmarks in the Florida Keys.\n\nIn the days after the hurricane, due to the heavy rainfall, numerous rivers had flooded, including residential areas.Public health risks, such as diarrheal infections and mosquito-borne illnesses, remain from the flooding that resulted in the aftermath of the hurricane.A large concern from flooding is contamination because people become exposed to dirty floodwaters and the potential for contaminated water to enter the local water supply is significant.One example of an illness that can enter the water supply is leptospirosis, which is rat urine carries into the floodwaters.Untreated exposure to leptospirosis can cause kidney damage, meningitis, and liver failure.Noroviruses and other infections are also a risk.\n\nFollowing Irma\'s passage, a hand-carved wooden canoe was discovered on the banks of the Indian River and could be several hundred years old.The state has removed the canoe for examination and safe keeping.\n\nDue to Irma\'s and Hurricane Harvey\'s impact in Florida and Texas, U.S. employment declined in September 2017 for the first time since September 2010.The leisure and hospitality industries were especially hard hit, losing 111,000 jobs in September.\n\nIrma set multiple records for intensity, especially at easterly longitudes, time spent at such an intensity, and its intensity at landfall.When Irma reached Category 5 intensity with winds of at 11:45 UTC on September 5 at 57.7°W, it became the easternmost Atlantic hurricane of this strength on record, surpassing Hurricane David of 1979, later beaten by Hurricane Lorenzo 2 years later.By 00:15 UTC on September 6, Irma reached peak intensity with () winds and a minimum pressure of .This ties it with Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and Hurricane Rita of 2005 as the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed.Only five other Atlantic hurricanes have been recorded with wind speeds higher than Irma: Hurricane Allen of 1980, which had maximum sustained winds of , and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Gilbert of 1988, Hurricane Wilma of 2005, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, all of which had peak winds of .At the time, Irma was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; later surpassed by Hurricane Dorian, and was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007.In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category 5 strength winds, and the third-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, with a value of 64.9 units.Only the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane and Hurricane Ivan in 2004 achieved higher values.\n\nOn September 6, Irma made landfall on the islands of Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Virgin Gorda at peak strength.This ties Irma with cyclones Monica of 2006 and Winston of 2016, and typhoons Zeb of 1998 and Megi of 2010 as the seventh-strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall globally – in terms of sustained winds – trailing only Typhoon Goni of 2020 which bore winds of at landfall, Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 and Typhoon Meranti of 2016, which bore winds of at landfall, and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Typhoon Joan of 1959, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, which bore winds of at landfall.Irma is second to the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin, and is the first hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic at Category 5 status since Felix in 2007.Irma is the first recorded Category 5 hurricane to affect the northern Leeward Islands, and was one of the worst storms to hit the region on record, along with Hurricane Donna in 1960 and Hurricane Luis in 1995.In addition, Irma is only the second hurricane on record to make landfall in Cuba at Category 5 intensity, with the other being a hurricane in 1924.Furthermore, when Irma made landfall on Barbuda, Saint Martin, Virgin Gorda, and Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane, it became one of only two recorded Atlantic storms to make landfall in multiple nations at this strength; the other was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which struck both Eleuthera and the United States as a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nIrma made landfall in the Florida Keys with winds of and a pressure of , making it the strongest hurricane to strike Florida in terms of wind speed since Charley in 2004, and the most intense to strike the state in terms of barometric pressure since Andrew in 1992.In the span of two weeks, two Category 4 hurricanes—Harvey and Irma—struck the continental United States, the first time on record two Atlantic tropical cyclones of such strength made landfall on the country in the same hurricane season.This also marked only the third occurrence of two consecutive Atlantic storms making landfall in the United States as major hurricanes.The other two instances were the Great Charleston and Cheniere Caminada hurricanes in 1893, and hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne in 2004.\n\nBecause of the extensive damage and loss of life the hurricane caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Irma from its rotating naming lists in April 2018, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane.It was replaced with Idalia for the 2023 season.\n\nWeather of 2017 Tropical cyclones in 2017 List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes Operation RUMAN – UK military-civil disaster relief response to Hurricane Irma.List of Cuba hurricanes List

27,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Hurricane Irma', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'Hurricane Irma was an extremely powerful Cape Verde hurricane that caused widespread destruction across its path in early September 2017.Irma was the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the Leeward Islands on record, followed by Maria two weeks later.At the time, it was considered the most powerful hurricane on record in the open Atlantic region, outside of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, until it was surpassed by Hurricane Dorian two years later.It was also the third-strongest Atlantic hurricane at landfall ever recorded, just behind the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane and Dorian.The ninth named storm, fourth hurricane, second major hurricane, and first Category 5 hurricane of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Irma caused widespread and catastrophic damage throughout its long lifetime, particularly in the northeastern Caribbean and the Florida Keys.It was also the most intense hurricane to strike the continental United States since Katrina in 2005, the first major hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Wilma in the same year, and the first Category 4 hurricane to strike the state since Charley in 2004.The word Irmageddon was coined soon after the hurricane to describe the damage caused by the hurricane.\n\nIrma developed from a tropical wave near the Cape Verde Islands on August 30.Favorable conditions allowed Irma to rapidly intensify into a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson wind scale by late on August 31.The storm\'s intensity fluctuated between Categories 2 and 3 for the next several days, due to a series of eyewall replacement cycles.On September 4, Irma resumed intensifying, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by early on the next day.Early on September 6, Irma peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of and a minimum pressure of .Irma was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017 in terms of barometric pressure, and the strongest worldwide in 2017 in terms of wind speed.Another eyewall replacement cycle caused Irma to weaken back to a Category 4 hurricane, but the storm re-attained Category 5 status before making landfall in Cuba.Although Irma briefly weakened to a Category 2 storm while making landfall on Cuba, the system re-intensified to Category 4 status as it crossed the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, before making landfall on Cudjoe Key on September 10.Irma then weakened to Category 3 status, prior to another landfall in Florida on Marco Island later that day.The system degraded into a remnant low over Alabama and ultimately dissipated on September 13 over Missouri.\n\nThe storm caused catastrophic damage in Barbuda, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Anguilla, and the Virgin Islands as a Category 5 hurricane.The hurricane caused at least 134 deaths: one in Anguilla; one in Barbados; three in Barbuda; four in the British Virgin Islands; 10 in Cuba; 11 in the French West Indies; one in Haiti; three in Puerto Rico; four on the Dutch side of Sint Maarten; 92 in the contiguous United States, and four in the U.S. Virgin Islands.Hurricane Irma was the top Google searched term in the U.S. and globally in 2017.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa on August 26.The tropical wave moved off the coast of the continent late on August 27.Throughout the next two days, showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low-pressure area, as the system passed just south of and then through the Cape Verde Islands on August 29.Around 00:00 UTC on the following day, the system developed into a tropical depression just west of the Cape Verde Islands.Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Irma, based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates.With warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, strengthening was anticipated, with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier air.\n\nThe nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow, as an anticyclone became established over the system, with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images.Early on August 31, shortly after the development of a central dense overcast (CDO) and an eye feature, Irma underwent rapid intensification, becoming a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 UTC and then a Category 3 hurricane, becoming a major hurricane – around 00:00 UTC on September 1.Within a 48-hour period, the hurricane\'s intensity had increased by .On September 2, a ship passed to the west of the center of Irma, recording maximum winds of , which indicated that the eye of Irma remained compact.A strong high pressure system to the north of Irma caused the storm to move west-southwestward between September 2 and September 4.The first aircraft reconnaissance mission departed from Barbados on the afternoon of September 3, discovering an eye in diameter and surface winds of .\n\nOn September 4, after moving into more favorable conditions, Irma strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane.As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by 12:00 UTC on the following day, with winds of .The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at near 18:00 UTC on September 5. Irma acquired annular characteristics around this time, with the storm exhibiting a large, symmetric CDO and an impressive satellite appearance.Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern Leeward Islands.Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of Barbuda at peak intensity, with the storm\'s central minimum pressure having bottomed out at – this was the lowest in the Atlantic since Dean in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of .Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15 UTC on Sint Maarten, and at 16:30 UTC on Virgin Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands, though the storm\'s central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall.\n\nAs the hurricane moved away from the Virgin Islands late on September 6, observations from reconnaissance flights, as well as Doppler radar in San Juan, Puerto Rico, indicated an elliptical eye and double eyewalls.Late on September 6, the cyclone passed about north of Puerto Rico.Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of Hispaniola throughout the day on September 7.After beginning an eyewall replacement cycle, Irma weakened to a Category 4 hurricane as it passed south of the Turks and Caicos Islands early on September 8.This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category 5 intensity, the second-longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above – behind only the 1932 Cuba hurricane.At 05:00 UTC on September 8, Irma made landfall on the island of Little Inagua in the Bahamas with sustained winds of .The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a subtropical ridge to its north.Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category 5 intensity at 18:00 UTC that day east of Cuba as deep convection became more pronounced and organized.The hurricane then made landfall in Cayo Romano, Cuba, at 03:00 UTC on September 9, with winds of .This made Irma only the second Category 5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the 1924 Cuba hurricane.As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category 2 storm later on September 9.\n\nAfter slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards Florida around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental United States.Moving over the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, Irma quickly restrengthened to a Category 4 hurricane at 06:00 UTC on September 10, as deep convection improved and the eye became better defined.In addition, Irma\'s wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of and gale-force winds spanning in diameter.The cyclone made landfall in Cudjoe Key, Florida, at 13:00 UTC on September 10, at Category 4 intensity, with winds of .Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category 3 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30 UTC, in Marco Island, Florida, with sustained winds of .Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category 3 intensity hours after landfall.Passing east of Tampa as a weakening Category 1 hurricane around 06:00 UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation – though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds.The system finally weakened to a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC that day as it entered southern Georgia, while acquiring some extratropical characteristics.At 06:00 UTC on September 12, Irma degenerated to a remnant low just as it entered Alabama, as most of the deep convection had diminished.The remnants persisted for another day or so before dissipating over Missouri on September 13.\n\nGiven that Irma\'s forecast track was along much of the Caribbean island chain, hurricane warnings were issued for the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and parts of Hispaniola on September 5.\n\nIn Antigua and Barbuda, residents safeguarded their homes and cleaned up their properties in anticipation of strong winds.Emergency crews were put on standby at public shelters and hospitals by September 5 to assist with any evacuations.Expecting a direct hit, more than half of the residents on Barbuda took shelter, and relief supplies were preemptively mobilized.The National Emergency Management Organization on Saint Lucia urged small craft operators and swimmers to be mindful of forecasts for high surf.Small Craft Warnings and High Surf Advisories were hoisted for Dominica, where residents were urged to remain vigilant of the potential for high waves, landslides, and flooding.\n\nIn Guadeloupe, low-lying and cliff-edge homes were evacuated at the threat of flooding and erosion.Schools and public businesses closed on September 5 and 6.Hospitals stocked up on three days\' worth of supplies and checked the functionality of their generators.Of the island\'s 32 communes, 22 activated their emergency plans; 1,500 people were urged to take shelter.The island sustained relatively minor damage and became the base for relief efforts on Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.Though the core of the hurricane was expected to remain north of the island, a yellow alert was issued for Martinique due to the likelihood of rough seas.The island dispatched relief supplies and military reinforcements to its neighboring islands of Guadeloupe, Saint Martin.and Saint Barthélemy, which faced a greater risk of a direct impact.\n\nOn September 4, Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency.By September 6, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency had deployed response teams in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.Supplies, including food rations, medical supplies, and blankets, were pre-staged in strategic locations on the islands for distribution.\n\nOn September 5, the Dominican Republic activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage; the United States and Haiti followed suit two days later.According to officials, 11,200 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas prior to the storm\'s arrival.Approximately 7,400 tourists were moved to Santo Domingo, away from beach resorts.In Haiti, government officials and aid organizations struggled with early preparation and evacuation efforts.While some officials blamed reluctance and indifference on the part of the population, others ""admitted they were not prepared for the onslaught and no mandatory evacuation orders were in place ahead of Irma\'s approach.""Local officials contended that they had not received promised funds, supplies, or equipment from the national government.The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti prepared its 1,000 peacekeepers and engineers to assist.\n\nIn the Turks and Caicos, evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas starting September 5. Schools were closed, government buildings were boarded up, and shelters were opened.Officials spread warnings to residents in English, Creole, and Spanish via social media, radio, SMS text, and WhatsApp.In The Bahamas, the government began preparations the week prior to the hurricane\'s arrival, including securing national sports facilities to use as shelters.By September 7, the government had evacuated 1,609 people by air from the southern islands, including 365 from Bimini.Controlled cutting of the power supply to southern and central Bahamian islands was conducted in advance of the storm.Shelters were made available, though usage was low due to most evacuees staying with family on other islands.Of the 2,679 foreign tourists still in The Bahamas on September 7, about 1,200 were being housed at Atlantis Paradise Island, one of the most hurricane-ready structures in the country.\n\nIn Cuba, meteorologists did not initially predict a direct hit.Fuel conservation was enacted in Camagüey Province to ensure that enough would be available during post-storm power outages.The Civil Defense evacuated nearly one million people from low-lying areas, including thousands of Canadian and European tourists in the Jardines del Rey.Dolphins at a Cayo Guillermo resort were evacuated by helicopter.\n\nThe NHC issued several watches and warnings for the Southeastern United States.The first watches and warnings were issued at 15:00 UTC on September 7, which was a hurricane watch from the Jupiter Inlet to Bonita Beach, including the Florida Keys and Lake Okeechobee.The watches and warnings were extended into Georgia and South Carolina on September 9.At 21:00 UTC on that day, the advisories reached their maximum extent, with a hurricane warning covering the entire east coast of the state, the west coast from Indian Pass southward, and the Florida Keys; a hurricane watch was in place from the Florida–Georgia state line to Edisto Beach, South Carolina; and there were two tropical storm warnings, one in Florida from Indian Pass to the Okaloosa–Walton county line and the other from the Florida–Georgia state line to the South Santee River in South Carolina.Watches and warnings were gradually discontinued as Irma moved inland and weakened, with all of them canceled by early on September 12.\n\nOn September 4, Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency.Governor Scott placed 100 members of the Florida National Guard on duty to assist in preparations.All 7,000 troops were ordered to be on duty by September 8.Officials advised residents to stock their hurricane kits.The state coordinated with electrical companies in order for power outages to be restored as quickly as possible, extending resources such as equipment, fuel, and lodging for the approximately 24,000 restoration personnel who had been activated.Governor Scott suspended tolls on all toll roads in Florida, including the turnpike.All state offices in Florida were closed from September 8 to September 11, while public schools, state colleges, and state universities in all 67 counties were closed during the same period.The Florida Department of Education coordinated with school districts as the need for transportation by school buses and opening shelters arose.By September 9, more than 150 state parks were closed.Throughout the state, almost 700 emergency shelters were opened.The shelters collectively housed about 191,764 people, with more than 40% of them staying in a shelter in South Florida.Additionally, more than 60 special needs shelters were opened, which housed more than 5,000 people by September 9.\n\nMany airports across the state, particularly in Central and South Florida, were closed.Nearly 9,000 flights intending to arrive in or depart from Florida were canceled.Along Florida\'s coasts, most seaports were closed or opened with restricted access.For the fifth time in its 45-year history, the Walt Disney World Resort was completely closed due to the storm.Its theme parks, water parks, and Disney Springs were all closed by 9:00 p.m. on September 9 and remained closed until September 12.Other Orlando-area theme parks, including Universal Orlando Resort and SeaWorld Orlando, were also closed.The Kennedy Space Center was closed from September 8 to September 15.\n\nAn estimated 6.5 million Floridians were ordered to evacuate, mostly those living on barrier islands or in coastal areas; in mobile or sub-standard homes; and in low-lying or flood prone areas.Mandatory evacuations were ordered for portions of Brevard, Broward, Citrus, Collier, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Glades, Hendry, Hernando, Indian River, Lee, Martin, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Lucie, Sumter, and Volusia counties.All of Monroe County, where the Florida Keys are located, was placed under a mandatory evacuation.Residents in communities near the southern half of Lake Okeechobee were also ordered to leave.Additionally, voluntary evacuation notices were issued for all or parts of Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Charlotte, Columbia, Desoto, Hardee, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lake, Manatee, Okeechobee, Osceola, and Polk counties.\n\nA record 6.5 million Floridians evacuated, making it the largest evacuation in the state\'s history.Evacuees caused significant traffic congestion on northbound Interstate 95, Interstate 75, and Florida\'s Turnpike, exacerbated by the fact that the entire Florida peninsula was within the cone of uncertainty in the NHC\'s forecast path in the days before the storm, so evacuees from both coasts headed north, as evacuees would not be safer by fleeing to the opposite coast.Fuel was in short supply throughout peninsular Florida during the week before Irma\'s arrival, especially along evacuation routes, leading to hours-long lines at fuel stations and even escorts of fuel trucks by the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nUse of the left shoulder as a lane for moving traffic was allowed on northbound Interstate 75 from Wildwood to the Georgia state line beginning September 8 and on eastbound Interstate 4 from Tampa to State Road 429 near Celebration for a few hours on September 9.It was the first time that the shoulder-use plan, which was introduced at the start of the 2017 hurricane season, was implemented by the state for hurricane evacuations.The shoulder-use plan was implemented in place of labor- and resource-intensive contraflow lane reversal, in which both sides of an interstate highway are used for one direction of traffic.\n\nOfficials from the Environmental Protection Agency, which had been criticized for its response to Hurricane Harvey, took special measures to inspect and secure hazardous materials, especially at Superfund sites.Direct Relief, a disaster relief organization, coordinated with local health centers and provided resources to help facilities on the front lines of Floridian and Puerto Rican communities.\n\nGeorgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency initially for all six coastal counties on September 6, but eventually expanded the declaration to 94 counties south of Atlanta metropolitan area, and then the entire state on September 10.Atlanta was placed under its first-ever tropical storm warning.Governor Deal ordered mandatory evacuations for all areas east of Interstate 95 on September 7, before extending the order to the entirety of Chatham County and low-lying areas west of I-95 on the following day.In total, 540,000 people on the Georgia coast were ordered to leave.Contraflow lane reversal for Interstate 16 took effect on the morning of September 9 from Savannah to Dublin, Georgia.All Georgia state parks were open for free to evacuees, as was the 800-acre camping area at Atlanta Motor Speedway.Reversible HOT lanes on Interstate 75 in Georgia through south metro Atlanta were open 24 hours northbound with no tolls.\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on September 6, with South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster following suit the same day.Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency on September 8 in order to protect Virginia residents and to mobilize resources in support of neighboring states.Officials in New Orleans stated that there would not be much time for preparations if Irma failed to make the projected northward turn, but that South Texas or Florida would not be a good evacuation destination.On September 10, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam issued an executive order allowing medical professionals in other states to practice in Tennessee to aid Hurricane Irma evacuees.This order also allowed pharmacies to give out 14-day supplies of medicine, and gave women and children from outside the state the ability to participate in the Tennessee Department of Health programs.Bristol Motor Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway, and Charlotte Motor Speedway all opened their campgrounds to evacuees free of charge.\n\nIn professional sports, the Miami Dolphins–Tampa Bay Buccaneers game scheduled for September 10 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was postponed to November 19 due to the storm\'s threat.The Dolphins left early for their road game against the Los Angeles Chargers.The Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees moved their September 11–13 series from Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg to Citi Field in Queens.Minor League Baseball\'s Florida State League, Carolina League, and Southern League called off their championship finals and as a result, named their division series winners league co-champions.The Miami FC versus San Francisco Deltas match on September 10 was cancelled so the players and staff could prepare for the storm with their families.The Orlando Pride of the National Women\'s Soccer League rescheduled their September 9 match to September 7. Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer did not have any scheduled home games in September, but was unable to return to training facilities in Orlando due to Hurricane Irma.\n\nIn college football, the UCF Knights-Memphis Tigers game scheduled for September 9 was moved to September 30, replacing UCF\'s game against Maine and Memphis game against Georgia State.UCF also cancelled their game against Georgia Tech on September 16, as UCF\'s stadium hosted the National Guard.The USF Bulls-Connecticut Huskies football game was also cancelled.The Miami Hurricanes–Arkansas State Redwolves game scheduled for September 9 at Centennial Bank Stadium in Arkansas was canceled due to travel concerns for the University of Miami.The Florida Gators-Northern Colorado Bears match in Gainesville scheduled for September 9 was cancelled.The Florida State Seminoles contest against the Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks was canceled on September 8.The Seminoles\' rivalry game with the Hurricanes in Tallahassee, originally scheduled for September 16, was postponed tp October 7.The FIU Panthers game against the Alcorn State Braves was moved up a day and relocated to Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.The Georgia Southern Eagles game against the New Hampshire Wildcats on September 9 was also moved to Legion Field for that day.\n\nAs of September 5, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding was running dangerously low, due to its response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas the previous week, prompting the Trump administration to request an immediate $8 billion in additional funding as Irma approached Florida.Given the rate that current funds are being consumed and the catastrophic damage, the United States Senate almost doubled the requested amount to $15.3 billion, with the understanding that this would only be about 10% of what will be required for responding to Harvey.\n\nHurricane Irma\'s path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating, with landfalls in Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Martin, the Bahamas, Cuba, and the United States, all at major hurricane intensity.Furthermore, the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences.Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria.\n\nThe eyewall of the hurricane moved over Barbuda near its record peak intensity early on September 6; a weather station observed a wind gust of .The same station also recorded a minimum barometric pressure of .The exact state of the island remained unclear for hours after Irma\'s passage, as downed phone lines ceased all communication with nearby islands.Later that afternoon, Prime Minister Gaston Browne surveyed the territory by helicopter, revealing an effectively uninhabitable island.Irma damaged or destroyed 95% of the structures on Barbuda, including its hospital, schools, and both of its hotels; it completely flattened some residential blocks while submerging others.The destruction rendered the island\'s sole airport and much of its infrastructure inoperative—including water and telecommunication services—which further hampered relief efforts.Property damage on Barbuda ranged from $150 million to $300 million.A total of three storm-related deaths were reported on the island.\n\nIn addition to the catastrophic impact on Barbuda\'s human residents, concern turned to the storm\'s effects on the island\'s wildlife.The island\'s only endemic bird, the near-threatened Barbuda warbler, numbered less than 2,000 individuals prior to the hurricane.For some time it was unknown if the warbler survived the hurricane or its aftermath; however within a few months it was confirmed that not only did the species survive, but the most of the birds survived the storm.Barbuda\'s Codrington Lagoon, home to the largest colony of magnificent frigatebirds in the Caribbean, with an estimated 2,500 nesting pairs, was also inundated by the storm surge.\n\nRemaining just outside of Irma\'s strongest windfield, Antigua sustained less severe damage, in the form of leveled roofs and fences, downed power poles and lines, and uprooted trees.Some street flooding also took place in low-lying areas.Three people were treated for minor storm-related injuries.Forensic disaster analysts from the Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM), a Germany-based risk management agency, estimate that economic losses for Antigua and Barbuda will exceed $120 million.\n\nOn the morning of September 6, Irma\'s center crossed the island of Saint Martin while the storm was at peak intensity, sweeping away entire structures, submerging roads and cars, and triggering an island-wide blackout.Irma\'s extreme winds ripped trees out of the ground and sent vehicles and debris from damaged structures scattered across the territory.On the French side of Saint-Martin, entire marinas around Marigot were left in ruins, littered with the stranded remnants of boats that had smashed into each other.A hotel caught on fire, but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze.Another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor.Media images depicted devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds had shattered their windows.Irma killed four people on the French side of the island and injured 50 others, one of whom was in critical condition.As many as 95% of the buildings there were damaged to some degree; 60% of those were totally uninhabitable.Estimates from CEDIM indicate a minimum of $950 million worth of economic losses.Total losses exceeded €3.5 billion (US$4.17 billion).\n\nA similar situation unfolded in Sint Maarten, Saint Martin\'s Dutch half, as intense winds ripped through buildings and lifted vehicles aloft ""as if they were matches"".The hurricane wreaked havoc on Princess Juliana International Airport, with ""huge chunks of the building [strewn] across the runway and a jet bridge snapped in half.""It demolished or severely damaged about 70% of Sint Maarten\'s houses, forcing thousands of residents into public shelters.There were 4 deaths and 23 injuries, 11 of which were serious, in the Dutch territory.Irma is considered the worst natural disaster to hit Sint Maarten; the extent of its damage far exceeded that of any previous hurricane.Total damages were estimated at €2.5 billion (US$2.98 billion).\n\nIrma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the French island of Saint Barthélemy, southeast of Saint Martin.Describing the extent of the destruction, one local compared it to ""a bomb that burned all vegetation,"" while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively ""erased the island from the map"".Violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments, with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation.Streets in the capital of Gustavia were turned into rushing rivers, which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture.The island\'s fire station was inundated with up to of flood waters.With scores of homes and much of the infrastructure destroyed, the majority of the island\'s population was left stranded and without water, electricity or phone service.The associated economic losses could exceed $480 million according to CEDIM\'s analysts.\n\nPreliminary assessments from the French government indicate that Hurricane Irma caused a combined €1.2 billion (US$1.43 billion) in insured losses across the French territories of Saint-Martin and Saint Barts.This total covered private property such as homes, vehicles and businesses (including lost revenue); the extent of the damage to infrastructural and public facilities remains undetermined.Nonetheless, this made Irma one of the costliest natural disasters to hit the French Republic in 50 years.\n\nOn January 30, 2018, roughly five months after Irma, an analysis was published indicating that an anemometer on the island recorded an unofficial gust to before failing.\n\nThe British Overseas Territory of Anguilla saw the eyewall of the storm pass over it on September 6.Many homes and schools were destroyed, and the island\'s only hospital was badly damaged.The devastation was particularly severe in East End, where the winds uprooted scores of trees and power poles and demolished a number of houses.In The Valley, the island\'s capital, the hurricane blew out the windows of government buildings.Rough seas inflicted heavy damage upon several bays and harbors, and a seaside restaurant was completely eradicated.About 90% of roads were left impassable.The island\'s air traffic control tower was damaged, exacerbating the already poor communication with the island.One death was reported on the island.Estimates of losses on the island total at least $190 million.\n\nLarge swells ahead of Irma washed ashore debris and sea life in Castries, Saint Lucia, blocking some roads.Seaside roads were inundated with water.One surfer was killed amid rough surf in Barbados after hitting a reef and breaking his neck.Trees were also destroyed.The hurricane\'s effects, such as violent seas and rattling trees, were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in Guadeloupe.Several houses were damaged.Around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm, leaving several communes in the dark without running water.Overall damage was limited to external parts of houses and trees that were blown onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seas.\n\nSaint Kitts and Nevis endured similar conditions to other islands.Blustery rainstorms triggered scattered power outages and disabled the island\'s water system, but per the International Red Cross, the islands were spared the level of destruction seen elsewhere.Still, Prime Minister Timothy Harris stated that property and infrastructure had sustained ""significant damage.""The Dutch territories of Saba and Sint Eustatius were also struck by the hurricane\'s winds, resulting in infrastructural damage, water shortages and telecommunication outages.Several houses were left uninhabitable.On Saba, the hurricane also defoliated trees and injured a few people.CEDIM\'s analysts expect economic losses of $20–65 million for the two islands.\n\nDamage in the British Virgin Islands was extensive.Numerous buildings and roads were destroyed on the island of Tortola, which bore the brunt of the hurricane\'s core.Four people were confirmed dead.Along Cane Garden Bay, the storm surge submerged several seaside bars and a gas station.Satellite images revealed many of the island\'s residential zones had been left in ruins.The hurricane passed over Necker Island, also causing severe damage and destroying the mansion of Richard Branson.\n\nMost homes and businesses were destroyed on the island of Jost Van Dyke, the smallest of the B.V.I.\'s four main islands.The Governor, Gus Jaspert, who had only been sworn into office 13 days previously, declared a state of emergency - the first time this has ever happened in the Territory.After the storm, restoration of electricity took approximately 5 months.\n\nIrma\'s effects in the U.S. Virgin Islands were most profound on Saint Thomas, where at least of rain fell, and on Saint John.Saint Thomas island suffered widespread structural damage, including to its police station and airport.Patients from the fourth and third floors of Charlotte Amalie\'s hospital had to be relocated to lower floors due to flooding from roof leaks.Three deaths were attributed to Irma on the island.On nearby Saint Croix, there were communication issues and some damage to the infrastructure.Saint John lost access to ferry and cargo services, along with access to the local airport.Due to its normal reliance on electricity from Saint Thomas, the island was left without power.Total damage from the three islands was at least $1.1 billion.\n\nThe hurricane passed north of Puerto Rico, but still caused significant damage to the United States territory.Along the coast, a tide gauge observed waves up to mean higher high water.Much of the main island experienced sustained tropical storm force winds, with a peak sustained wind speed of at a weather station along San Juan Bay, while the same site observed a peak wind gust of .However, on the island of Culebra, a wind gust of was reported.Mainly due to strong winds, approximately 1.1 million out of 1.5 million of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority\'s customers lost electricity.Portions of Puerto Rico received heavy rainfall, with a peak total of in Bayamón, causing seven rivers to reach flood stage, widespread flash flooding, and at least six landslides.\n\nThe most severely affected areas included the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques, as well as the northeastern, northern, and mountainous portions of the main island.On Culebra, the island suffered an almost complete loss of electrical and water services.At least 30 homes on the island were destroyed, while about 30 other experienced substantial damage.High winds also toppled a number of trees.The only telecommunications tower on Culebra sustained damage, cutting off outside communications for several hours.In rural Loíza, 79 homes were destroyed.Throughout Puerto Rico, 781 out of 1,600 telecommunications towers went out of commission, primarily due to power outages.At least 362,000 customers lost water services.Debris, mostly fallen trees, blocked at least 72 roads.Approximately 25% to 30% of banana, coffee, papaya, and plantain crops were damaged by strong winds, with losses to farmers estimated at $30.6 million.Approximately 1,530 homes experienced at least moderate damage, with 1,448 homes moderately damaged, 32 extensively damaged, and 50 completely destroyed.\n\nHurricane Irma was attributed to around $1 billion in damage, and the NHC attributed three fatalities to Irma in Puerto Rico, though four deaths were related to the storm.Two people died due to rainstorms ahead of the hurricane: one man died in Orocovis after falling off his ladder while repairing his roof; another man on the coast in Capitanejo died after being struck by lightning.Three nearby fishermen were burned by the same lightning strike, but survived.Two other people died during the hurricane: a woman died while being evacuated from her house in a wheelchair and fell, hitting her head; another person died in a car accident in Canóvanas.Governor Ricardo Rosselló declared the islands of Culebra and Vieques to be disaster areas.\n\nAlthough spared a direct hit, both the Dominican Republic and Haiti were affected by high winds and heavy rains.A bridge over the Dajabón River connecting the two countries was broken.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, the fishing community of Nagua sustained damage from waves that destroyed homes.55,000 soldiers were deployed to affected areas to help with the clean-up efforts.By the evening of September 7, the government had counted 2,721 damaged homes.\n\nIn Haiti, flooding one meter deep sat in residential neighborhoods in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives.Mudslides, destroyed homes, flooded crops, and infrastructure damage were reported in the northern part of the country.The total expanse of the flooding stretched from Môle-Saint-Nicolas in the west to the eastern border with the Dominican Republic.\n\nOn the evening of September 7, at 7:30 pm AST (23:30 UTC), Hurricane Irma reached the Turks and Caicos Islands.While the eye passed just south of the main islands, crossing over South Caicos and the Ambergris Cays, the most powerful winds on the northern side of the eye swept all of the islands for more than two hours.Communications infrastructure was destroyed.\n\nOn September 8, Minister of Infrastructure Goldray Ewing confirmed that damage to Providenciales was extensive, with the northwestern neighborhood of Blue Hill being ""gone"".The hospital in the capital, Cockburn Town, was heavily damaged.On South Caicos, 75% of roofs were lost.Total damage was estimated at over $500 million.\n\nIn the Bahamas, the eye of the storm passed over Duncan Town, the major settlement of the Ragged Islands chain, on September 8.It also passed ""almost directly over"" Inagua and South Acklins, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.\n\nDamages were largely confined to the southern islands starting the morning of September 8.On Mayaguana and Great Inagua, downed power lines knocked out communications.On Great Inagua, 70% of homes sustained roof damage, and the island\'s school lost its roof entirely.The Morton Salt Company\'s signature production facility, one of the major employers in the country, experienced millions of dollars in damages.The Acklins settlement of Salina Point was cut off from the rest of the island by flooding, while Crooked Island had widespread roof damage.In the northern Bahamas, the worst property damage came on September 10 as the outer bands of the system produced tornadic activity on Grand Bahama and Bimini.Damage and losses across The Bahamas amounted to $135 million.\n\nWhile Irma was making landfall in Florida, the ocean was drawn away from some western shorelines of the Bahamas due to strong easterly winds.\n\nEarly on September 9, Irma made landfall on the Camagüey Archipelago off the northern coast of Cuba, with sustained winds of .The strongest official sustained wind speed was , while the highest wind gust reached ; both were observed near Camila in Ciego de Ávila Province.The weather station at Esmeralda, Camagüey, was damaged, with the wind gauge destroyed.The north coast of Cuba experienced significant coastal flooding due to storm surge and abnormally high tides generated by the storm.Wave heights at Cayo Romano exceeded .Storm surge penetrated as far as inland in some areas of Villa Clara Province.Multiple locations on the island observed at least of rainfall, with a peak total of of precipitation at Topes de Collantes.\n\nA total of 158,554 homes experienced some degree of damage, of which 14,657 were destroyed; approximately 1.9 million people experienced the direct effects of Irma.The storm partially deroofed 103,691 homes, while 23,560 were completely deroofed.Irma damaged or destroyed 980 health facilities and 2,264 schools.Approximately 3.1 million people experienced disruptions to the water supply, while 246,707 people lost telephone service.About of roads were damaged.Crops also suffered extensively, with nearly affected by the storm.Throughout the country, the hurricane inflicted $13.185 billion in damage and killed 10 people, making Irma the costliest tropical cyclone in Cuban history.\n\nThe tourist areas of Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and Cayo Santa María and the nearby town of Caibarién received the brunt of the storm, with waves rolling through town and the characteristic one-story homes completely flooded.The storm most severely Ciego de Ávila and Villa Clara provinces.Flooding worsened as the hurricane moved west, pushing the storm surge along to the regions around Havana.By the afternoon, limited flooding was occurring in Havana, including around the Malecón.Portions of province coastal flooding surpassing that which was experienced during the Storm of the Century in 1993 and Hurricane Wilma in 2005.In the city of Santa Clara, 39 buildings collapsed.Rainfall resulted in several rivers reaching major flood stage.The town of Cabaiguán in Sancti Spíritus Province in particular suffered extensive inland flooding after the Zaza River swelled.\n\nHurricane Irma directly affected a major colony of American flamingos on Cuba\'s northern Cayo Coco.Early reports from Diario de Cuba indicated that several hundred flamingos had been killed by the storm, though other estimates ranged as high as several thousand birds.\n\nHurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida.Except for the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned.Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba, but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys.The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States.After surveying the aftermath of Irma, Florida governor Rick Scott said ""I thought we would see more damage""[on the mainland] but said ""he witnessed devastation in the Keys"".President Donald Trump commented on Twitter that the devastation in some places was ""far greater than anyone thought"".\n\nDamage in the United States was estimated at a minimum of $50 billion.At the time, Irma was the fourth costliest tropical cyclone in the United States, behind hurricanes Sandy in 2012, Harvey earlier that year, and Katrina in 2005.However, later in September 2017, Hurricane Maria became the third costliest United States tropical cyclone, causing Irma to fall to the fifth costliest.At least 92 people, 10 directly and 82 indirectly, died throughout the United States in relation to Irma: 84 in Florida, 3 in Georgia, 3 in South Carolina, and 2 in North Carolina.\n\nIrma struck the state less than two weeks after Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten had caused the worst flooding seen in western Florida in 20 years, which further worsened the impacts in the region.The storm\'s large wind field resulted in strong winds across much of Florida, except for the western Panhandle.The highest reported sustained wind speed was on Marco Island, while the strongest observed wind gust was , recorded near Naples, though wind gusts of likely occurred in the Middle Florida Keys.More than 7.7 million homes and businesses in Florida were left without electricity at some point – approximately 73% of state.Generally heavy amounts of rainfall were recorded to the east of the Irma\'s path, including a peak total of in Fort Pierce.Heavy precipitation – and storm surge, in some instances – overflowed at least 32 rivers and creeks, causing significant flooding, particularly along the St. Johns River and its tributaries.Many homes and businesses suffered damage or destruction, with more than 65,000 structures damaged to some degree in West Central and Southwest Florida alone.Agriculture experienced about $2.5 billion in damage.It was estimated that the cyclone caused at least $50 billion in damage, making Irma the costliest hurricane in Florida history, surpassing Hurricane Andrew, until it was itself surpassed by Hurricane Ian, 5 years later.\n\nThroughout Florida, at least 84 people died in storm-related incidents.About half of the deaths occurred from drowning, trauma, and carbon monoxide poisoning.Broward County had 21 fatalities, the most of any county in Florida.Among those deaths were 12 people at The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, a Hollywood nursing home.The patients died from sweltering heat worsened by the lack of air conditioning.The hurricane also left at least 14 deaths in Monroe County; 6 deaths in Orange County; 5 deaths each in Duval, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties; 4 deaths in both Highlands and Hillsborough counties; 3 deaths in both Marion and Polk counties; 2 deaths each in Collier, Hardee, Leon, Pinellas, St. Lucie, and Taylor counties; and 1 death in Hendry, Lake, Lee, Liberty, Manatee, Nassau, Okeechobee, Pasco, Seminole, St. Johns, and Volusia counties.\n\nWith Irma making landfall in Monroe County as a Category 4 hurricane, the Florida Keys were hardest hit area in the state.Strong winds and storm surge flooding caused major damage to buildings, trailer parks, boats, roads, the electricity supply, mobile phone coverage, internet access, sanitation, the water supply and the fuel supply throughout the island chain.An estimated storm surge occurred at Cudjoe Key, where Irma made landfall.Throughout the island, 625 homes sustained minor damage, 52 sustained major damage, and 81 were demolished.On Big Pine Key, one of the most devastated islands, 633 homes received minor impact, 299 homes received major impact, and 473 homes were completely destroyed.Overall in Monroe County, 27,649 homes experienced some degree of damage, including 1,179 homes being destroyed, 2,977 homes receiving major damage, and 5,361 suffering minor damage.\n\nAfter devastating the Keys, the storm then struck Collier County as a Category 3 hurricane.Several communities in the county suffered extensive damage, especially along the coast.Throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, 65 homes, including 44 mobile homes, were demolished, while 1,008 homes received major damage.Property damages in unincorporated areas alone reach about $320 million.Lee County was lashed by strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused prolonged flooding in some areas.More than 24,000 homes suffered some degree of damage, with almost 3,000 homes receiving major damage and 89 homes being destroyed.Damage in the county totaled about $857 million.\n\nImpact in much of the Miami metropolitan area was generally limited to extensive tree and fence damage, as well as widespread power outages.However, in Miami-Dade County, about 1,000 homes received major damage and about 50% of crops were lost.Storm surge caused coastal flooding from Homestead to Downtown Miami, as well as in portions of Miami Beach.Parts of the Florida Heartland were devastated by high winds and flooding, particularly Hendry and Highlands counties.In the former, which has most citrus trees of any county in Florida, about 60% of orange crops were lost.Throughout Hendry County, a total of 451 homes had minor damage, 131 homes suffered major damage, and 42 others were destroyed.In Highlands County, 13,138 businesses and homes were damaged to some degree, with 144 being destroyed, 963 sustaining major damage, and 2,408 receiving minor damage.In Orange County, wind gusts reached 79 mph at Orlando International Airport.A wind gust of 91 mph was also recorded in Orlando at the top of the Disney Contemporary Resort.Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central Florida left some wind damage and flooding, necessitating evacuations and rescues, including more than 200 people in Orlo Vista after hundreds of homes were flooded.A total of 2,999 business or homes were damaged in Lake County, 7,430 in Seminole County, and 3,457 in Volusia County.Additionally, eight tornadoes touched down in Brevard County, all of which caused damage.\n\nAlong much of the Gulf Coast of Florida, to the north of where Irma made landfall, negative storm surges were observed, with water retracting rather than pushing inland, causing little coastal flooding.However, on the opposite coast, extensive erosion and storm surge flooding occurred in the First Coast, especially in Duval and St. Johns counties.In Duval County, the St. Johns River crested at heights that exceeded records set during Hurricane Dora in 1964.Portions of Jacksonville experienced flooding, particularly the downtown area and the Riverside and San Marco neighborhoods, with about 350 people rescued in those sections of the city.Water reached about high in some homes.The city of Jacksonville suffered about $85 million in damage.\n\nIn St. Johns County, storm surge left extensive damage to oceanfront properties in Ponte Vedra Beach and Vilano Beach, with several becoming uninhabitable.Additionally, some riverfront businesses in St. Augustine\'s historic district were flooded due to storm surge from the Matanzas River.In nearby Clay County, rainfall and storm surge combined to cause extensive flooding along portions of the Black Creek and the St. Johns River, with record high crests at several locations along the former.About 350 people and 75 animals were rescued from floodwaters throughout the county.A total of 275 homes were destroyed, 175 were inflicted major damage, and 124 received minor damage.\n\nThree deaths were reported in Georgia due to falling trees and debris, along with widespread wind damage and power outages throughout the state primarily due to fallen trees.On Tybee Island, as well as St. Simons Island the storm surge caused extensive flooding.The tropical storm also did $54 million in damage in the state.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the third highest storm surge on record was recorded, reaching a height of approximately .By of September 12, almost 100,000 had lost power in Upstate South Carolina.Five people died in storm-related incidents across South Carolina, all from indirect incidents.The tropical storm caused damages totaling $500,000 in the state.\n\nLight damage occurred in other areas, including Tennessee.About 75,000 customers in North Carolina lost power due to Irma.It also caused $600,000 in damages in Alabama.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Irma\'s path through the West Indies and Caribbean, the devastation to roads, harbors and airports significantly impeded the transportation and distribution of relief supplies.Foreign countries moved to provide much of the initial aid.The British, Dutch, French, and United States governments sent warships and planes with supplies and manpower to the region.International leaders, including Dutch King Willem-Alexander and French President Emmanuel Macron, quickly moved to visit affected territories.\n\nSome of the affected countries and territories also offered assistance to each other.Cuba, which sustained extensive damage from the storm, sent 750 health workers to Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, Dominica, and Haiti.Government officials and members of the public in Puerto Rico delivered assistance and evacuated people stranded on other islands.The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services granted special 30-day humanitarian visas for British Virgin Islanders to stay in Puerto Rico.Hundreds of people stranded on Saint Martin were flown to the Dominican Republic on humanitarian grounds.\n\nIn response to Hurricane Jose\'s approach, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a mandatory evacuation on September 9 for any remaining residents on Barbuda.A Miami cargo plane landed on Antigua later that day, carrying over 60 tons (120,000 lbs) of relief supplies for the displaced storm victims—including bottled water, canned food and power generators.\n\nRFA Mounts Bay stationed itself near Anguilla and provided support and relief work to the island with its helicopters and 40 marines and army engineers.The ship delivered 6 tonnes of emergency aid to Anguilla and army engineers repaired a fuel leak at Anguilla\'s main petrol dump, restored power to the island\'s hospital and provided shelters for those left homeless by the hurricane.The ship arrived in the British Virgin Islands on September 8, 2017, to provide emergency relief to the islands, including providing shelters, food and water.HMS Ocean was diverted from the Mediterranean to provide relief from Gibraltar to the affected British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos on September 7, and aid was also supplied by the Department for International Development from their disaster response centre at Kemble Airfield.As part of a £32 million operation named Operation Ruman, nearly 500 UK military personnel with emergency relief were dispatched from RAF Brize Norton.This included the first deployment of No. 38 Expeditionary Air Wing with 3 RAF aircraft; 2 Airbus A400M Atlas and 1 C130J hercules to support relief efforts.\n\nThe British government also drafted 2 members of the UK police calibre into the region on September 10, and 53 police officers were drafted from RAF Brize Norton to the affected British Overseas Territories on September 15 to help maintain order.UK politicians, including the chairs of the foreign affairs and development select committees, criticized both the government\'s preparations for the storm and its response as inadequate.\n\nBy September 12, the Department for International Development had delivered more than 40 tonnes of aid into the region, including into Turks and Caicos, and 1,000 UK military troops were deployed in the region as part of relief efforts.The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, pledged an additional £25 million worth of funding as part of relief efforts in the region on September 13, 2017, and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Boris Johnson, said that a further 250 UK military personnel would be deployed into the area within the next few days.Anguilla\'s Chief Minister, Victor Banks, praised the British government\'s response to the storm and said that Boris Johnson\'s visit to the island ""sends a very positive signal to Anguillans that the British are serious about their response to this very severe hurricane"", but went on to say that the current financial commitment from the UK was not substantial enough.\n\nBy September 15, the United Kingdom had over 70 military personnel and 4 police officers in Anguilla and had delivered 15 tonnes of aid to the island.In the British Virgin Islands, Royal Marines had cleared the airfield so that it was operational for the delivery of aid into the islands, with more than 200 British military personnel and 54 UK police officers on the ground and 8 tonnes of aid delivered to the islands.120 British military personnel were on the ground in Turks and Caicos, and over 150 shelter kits and 720 liters of water were delivered to the islands on September 15.\n\nAmendments to international aid rules by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (or OECD) allowed for the UK government to provide access to £13 billion worth of aid to the affected British Overseas Territories, through the UK\'s Official Development Assistance (ODA) by November 2017.\n\nBy the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage.The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by Irma\'s eye, remained largely inaccessible for days.Assessments showed that 15% of the national telecommunications network had been affected, with at least one tower destroyed.Bahamasair resumed a limited domestic schedule on September 10, with international flights still cancelled due to existing and anticipated destruction at other destinations.\n\nThe worst devastation occurred on Ragged Island, over which Irma\'s eye had directly passed.After days of the National Emergency Management Agency not being able to physically reach the island, officials were finally able to inspect it; they promptly declared it uninhabitable.Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said that it was the worst disaster area he or his officials had ever seen, and that all remaining residents would need to leave, potentially permanently.Business leaders and other officials called for a new long-term development model to shift the population away from such sparsely-settled islands.\n\nOn Grand Bahama and Bimini, where tornadoes associated with Irma touched down on September 10, more than 100 people were left displaced.Infrastructure damage included docks, parks, and the power system.\n\nAside from tangible asset losses, Irma brought significant economic damages.International freight shipping was projected to be offline for a week, and costs for rebuilding supplies were inflated due to demand in the U.S.\n\nSwollen rivers contributed to worsening flooding in the days after the storm system left, resulting in additional evacuations.Officials resorted to using inflatable rafts to access affected areas.The national electrical infrastructure was said to be extensively damaged.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, flooding worsened following Irma\'s departure, leading the number of displaced persons to increase to more than 24,000 by September 8.President Danilo Medina ordered further evacuations due to at-risk dams, while the government banned swimming in rivers and ordered boats kept in port.More than 422,000 people were left without water due to 28 aqueducts being damaged.\n\nIn Haiti, officials stated that losses were greater than they could have been since people largely did not heed early preparation and evacuation warnings.At least 5,000 homes were flooded.One man died trying to cross a flooded river; another went missing and 17 were injured.The trash- and waste-contaminated floodwaters in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives led to fears of cholera outbreaks.Flooding continued to worsen days after the storm, as runoff from the mountains swelled rivers in low-lying farming communities.United Nations peacekeepers from Brazil were able to gain access to the flooded northwest region to provide urgent aid, but non-governmental organizations and Haitian economists warned that the estimated 30,000 victims would need longer-term assistance as well.Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant appointed a government commission to address Irma\'s effects, with Action Against Hunger in charge of humanitarian coordination.\n\nIn the USVI, residents and tourists alike were described as being in a state of traumatic shock.By September 7, the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship had arrived in the USVI to provide supplies, damage assessment, and evacuation assistance.Four additional warships, some of which had already been on their way to Texas to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief, were redirected to the region.At a September 10 news conference, Governor Kenneth Mapp described Irma as a ""horrific disaster"" for which ""[t]here will be no restorations or solutions in days or weeks.""The Federal Emergency Management Agency airlifted in goods for residents, who were subjected to a curfew.Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line agreed to transport tourists to Florida, contingent upon port availability following the state\'s own experience with Irma.\n\nOn Saint John, described as ""perhaps the site of Irma\'s worst devastation on American soil,"" it took six days for an active-theater disaster zone to be established, leading to criticism of the U.S. government response.The National Guard was delayed in reaching Saint John due to the number of overturned boats left in the harbor.The National Guard was brought in to maintain order, while the Coast Guard brought evacuees to cruise ships bound for San Juan and Miami.There was still no electricity on St. John in the middle of October 2017.\n\nBy September 9, more than one million Puerto Ricans were still without power, tens of thousands were without water, and several thousand were still in shelters.Hospitals were operating on generator power.The government was struggling to establish contact with the islands of Culebra and Vieques.By September 10, the main island had recovered enough to serve as a refuge for people stranded on other islands, including 1,200 tourists from Saint Martin and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Airlifts had brought more than 50 patients to Puerto Rico.\n\nFive months after Irma, two-thirds of the hospital beds on Saint Thomas were still unavailable, due to extensive physical damage and staffing shortages.\n\nDamage to Sint Maarten\'s harbour and to Princess Juliana International Airport left the Dutch part of Saint Martin unreachable, although the smaller Grand Case-Espérance Airport on the French side could be reopened by September 7 for supply aid by helicopter and airplane.The French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops on board a CASA/IPTN CN-235 aircraft.\n\nThe following day, the Dutch military was able to airlift dialysis patients off the island while also dropping leaflets to warn islanders about the rapidly approaching Hurricane Jose.Although the airport was closed, 435 students and faculty of the American University of the Caribbean were evacuated by the U.S. military.On September 10, Dutch King Willem-Alexander departed for the region, with intentions to visit Sint Maarten and other affected Dutch territories and commonwealth members.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron followed this announcement by stating his intentions to visit the French part of the island on September 12 in order to bring aid supplies.In response to criticism of the French handling of the disaster, 1,000 troops, police, and other emergency workers were sent to Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.\n\nOn both sides of Saint Martin, desperate conditions combined with food and water shortages in Irma\'s aftermath led to reports of violence, scavenging, and theft.In response, the French government increased its troop deployment to 2,200 and the Dutch government sent more than 600 military and police personnel.\n\nThe day after the hurricane hit Saint Barthelemy the French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops into the reopened Grand Case-Espérance Airport.On September 7 and 9, equipment and personnel were flown from France to Guadeloupe and Martinique.\n\nSporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm.\n\nOn September 11, Florida Governor Rick Scott conducted an aerial tour to survey the damage to the Keys.The Overseas Highway remained closed while authorities assessed the integrity of the 42 bridges along the route.Residents returning to the Keys were faced with a police roadblock, to the south of Florida City.USS Iwo Jima, USS New York and aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were sent to the Keys area to aid with the recovery.\n\nOn September 12, some residents were allowed to return into the Keys as far as Islamorada.Although road damage blocked entry any farther than Islamorada, bridges had been inspected and found safe to Sugarloaf Key.By late on September 12, the Overseas Highway had been repaired and the bridges inspected as safe for first responders to travel to Key West.On September 16, residents were free to return to Marathon.Residents were allowed to return to Key West the following day, although the Keys remained closed to tourists and a checkpoint remained in place in Florida City.\n\nDue mainly to the widespread loss of power, cell phone service was also reduced after battery backup power for cell phone towers ran out and backup generators ran out of fuel.In an impact report by the FCC, as of 11 AM EDT on September 12, 89 of 108 (82%) cell phone towers were non-functioning in Monroe County (Florida Keys), 154 of 212 (73%) were non-functioning in Collier County (Naples), 36 of 46 (78%) were non-functioning in Hendry County, and an additional six counties had 41-60% of cell phone towers not functioning, including Lee County (Fort Myers) and Miami-Dade County.\n\nNOAA released map-format aerial reconnaissance image data of damage from the storm.The imagery featured several areas of Florida: including the Florida Keys, the southwest coast of Florida from Marco Island to Punta Gorda, much of the northeast coast of Florida, and portions of the Jacksonville area.Portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts were also photographed.Additionally, the Sun-Sentinel published before and after photos of several landmarks in the Florida Keys.\n\nIn the days after the hurricane, due to the heavy rainfall, numerous rivers had flooded, including residential areas.Public health risks, such as diarrheal infections and mosquito-borne illnesses, remain from the flooding that resulted in the aftermath of the hurricane.A large concern from flooding is contamination because people become exposed to dirty floodwaters and the potential for contaminated water to enter the local water supply is significant.One example of an illness that can enter the water supply is leptospirosis, which is rat urine carries into the floodwaters.Untreated exposure to leptospirosis can cause kidney damage, meningitis, and liver failure.Noroviruses and other infections are also a risk.\n\nFollowing Irma\'s passage, a hand-carved wooden canoe was discovered on the banks of the Indian River and could be several hundred years old.The state has removed the canoe for examination and safe keeping.\n\nDue to Irma\'s and Hurricane Harvey\'s impact in Florida and Texas, U.S. employment declined in September 2017 for the first time since September 2010.The leisure and hospitality industries were especially hard hit, losing 111,000 jobs in September.\n\nIrma set multiple records for intensity, especially at easterly longitudes, time spent at such an intensity, and its intensity at landfall.When Irma reached Category 5 intensity with winds of at 11:45 UTC on September 5 at 57.7°W, it became the easternmost Atlantic hurricane of this strength on record, surpassing Hurricane David of 1979, later beaten by Hurricane Lorenzo 2 years later.By 00:15 UTC on September 6, Irma reached peak intensity with () winds and a minimum pressure of .This ties it with Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and Hurricane Rita of 2005 as the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed.Only five other Atlantic hurricanes have been recorded with wind speeds higher than Irma: Hurricane Allen of 1980, which had maximum sustained winds of , and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Gilbert of 1988, Hurricane Wilma of 2005, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, all of which had peak winds of .At the time, Irma was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; later surpassed by Hurricane Dorian, and was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007.In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category 5 strength winds, and the third-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, with a value of 64.9 units.Only the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane and Hurricane Ivan in 2004 achieved higher values.\n\nOn September 6, Irma made landfall on the islands of Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Virgin Gorda at peak strength.This ties Irma with cyclones Monica of 2006 and Winston of 2016, and typhoons Zeb of 1998 and Megi of 2010 as the seventh-strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall globally – in terms of sustained winds – trailing only Typhoon Goni of 2020 which bore winds of at landfall, Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 and Typhoon Meranti of 2016, which bore winds of at landfall, and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Typhoon Joan of 1959, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, which bore winds of at landfall.Irma is second to the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin, and is the first hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic at Category 5 status since Felix in 2007.Irma is the first recorded Category 5 hurricane to affect the northern Leeward Islands, and was one of the worst storms to hit the region on record, along with Hurricane Donna in 1960 and Hurricane Luis in 1995.In addition, Irma is only the second hurricane on record to make landfall in Cuba at Category 5 intensity, with the other being a hurricane in 1924.Furthermore, when Irma made landfall on Barbuda, Saint Martin, Virgin Gorda, and Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane, it became one of only two recorded Atlantic storms to make landfall in multiple nations at this strength; the other was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which struck both Eleuthera and the United States as a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nIrma made landfall in the Florida Keys with winds of and a pressure of , making it the strongest hurricane to strike Florida in terms of wind speed since Charley in 2004, and the most intense to strike the state in terms of barometric pressure since Andrew in 1992.In the span of two weeks, two Category 4 hurricanes—Harvey and Irma—struck the continental United States, the first time on record two Atlantic tropical cyclones of such strength made landfall on the country in the same hurricane season.This also marked only the third occurrence of two consecutive Atlantic storms making landfall in the United States as major hurricanes.The other two instances were the Great Charleston and Cheniere Caminada hurricanes in 1893, and hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne in 2004.\n\nBecause of the extensive damage and loss of life the hurricane caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Irma from its rotating naming lists in April 2018, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane.It was replaced with Idalia for the 2023 season.\n\nWeather of 2017 Tropical cyclones in 2017 List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes Operation RUMAN – UK military-civil disaster relief response to Hurricane Irma.List of Cuba hurricanes List

one in Barbados; three in Barbuda; four in the British Virgin Islands; 10 in Cuba; 11 in the French West Indies; one in Haiti; three in Puerto Rico; four on the Dutch side of Sint Maarten; 92 in the contiguous United States, and four in the U.S. Virgin Islands.Hurricane Irma was the top Google searched term in the U.S. and globally in 2017.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa on August 26.The tropical wave moved off the coast of the continent late on August 27.Throughout the next two days, showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low-pressure area, as the system passed just south of and then through the Cape Verde Islands on August 29.Around 00:00 UTC on the following day, the system developed into a tropical depression just west of the Cape Verde Islands.Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Irma, based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates.With warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, strengthening was anticipated, with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier air.\n\nThe nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow, as an anticyclone became established over the system, with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images.Early on August 31, shortly after the development of a central dense overcast (CDO) and an eye feature, Irma underwent rapid intensification, becoming a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 UTC and then a Category 3 hurricane, becoming a major hurricane – around 00:00 UTC on September 1.Within a 48-hour period, the hurricane\'s intensity had increased by .On September 2, a ship passed to the west of the center of Irma, recording maximum winds of , which indicated that the eye of Irma remained compact.A strong high pressure system to the north of Irma caused the storm to move west-southwestward between September 2 and September 4.The first aircraft reconnaissance mission departed from Barbados on the afternoon of September 3, discovering an eye in diameter and surface winds of .\n\nOn September 4, after moving into more favorable conditions, Irma strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane.As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by 12:00 UTC on the following day, with winds of .The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at near 18:00 UTC on September 5. Irma acquired annular characteristics around this time, with the storm exhibiting a large, symmetric CDO and an impressive satellite appearance.Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern Leeward Islands.Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of Barbuda at peak intensity, with the storm\'s central minimum pressure having bottomed out at – this was the lowest in the Atlantic since Dean in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of .Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15 UTC on Sint Maarten, and at 16:30 UTC on Virgin Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands, though the storm\'s central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall.\n\nAs the hurricane moved away from the Virgin Islands late on September 6, observations from reconnaissance flights, as well as Doppler radar in San Juan, Puerto Rico, indicated an elliptical eye and double eyewalls.Late on September 6, the cyclone passed about north of Puerto Rico.Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of Hispaniola throughout the day on September 7.After beginning an eyewall replacement cycle, Irma weakened to a Category 4 hurricane as it passed south of the Turks and Caicos Islands early on September 8.This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category 5 intensity, the second-longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above – behind only the 1932 Cuba hurricane.At 05:00 UTC on September 8, Irma made landfall on the island of Little Inagua in the Bahamas with sustained winds of .The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a subtropical ridge to its north.Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category 5 intensity at 18:00 UTC that day east of Cuba as deep convection became more pronounced and organized.The hurricane then made landfall in Cayo Romano, Cuba, at 03:00 UTC on September 9, with winds of .This made Irma only the second Category 5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the 1924 Cuba hurricane.As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category 2 storm later on September 9.\n\nAfter slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards Florida around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental United States.Moving over the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, Irma quickly restrengthened to a Category 4 hurricane at 06:00 UTC on September 10, as deep convection improved and the eye became better defined.In addition, Irma\'s wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of and gale-force winds spanning in diameter.The cyclone made landfall in Cudjoe Key, Florida, at 13:00 UTC on September 10, at Category 4 intensity, with winds of .Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category 3 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30 UTC, in Marco Island, Florida, with sustained winds of .Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category 3 intensity hours after landfall.Passing east of Tampa as a weakening Category 1 hurricane around 06:00 UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation – though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds.The system finally weakened to a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC that day as it entered southern Georgia, while acquiring some extratropical characteristics.At 06:00 UTC on September 12, Irma degenerated to a remnant low just as it entered Alabama, as most of the deep convection had diminished.The remnants persisted for another day or so before dissipating over Missouri on September 13.\n\nGiven that Irma\'s forecast track was along much of the Caribbean island chain, hurricane warnings were issued for the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and parts of Hispaniola on September 5.\n\nIn Antigua and Barbuda, residents safeguarded their homes and cleaned up their properties in anticipation of strong winds.Emergency crews were put on standby at public shelters and hospitals by September 5 to assist with any evacuations.Expecting a direct hit, more than half of the residents on Barbuda took shelter, and relief supplies were preemptively mobilized.The National Emergency Management Organization on Saint Lucia urged small craft operators and swimmers to be mindful of forecasts for high surf.Small Craft Warnings and High Surf Advisories were hoisted for Dominica, where residents were urged to remain vigilant of the potential for high waves, landslides, and flooding.\n\nIn Guadeloupe, low-lying and cliff-edge homes were evacuated at the threat of flooding and erosion.Schools and public businesses closed on September 5 and 6.Hospitals stocked up on three days\' worth of supplies and checked the functionality of their generators.Of the island\'s 32 communes, 22 activated their emergency plans; 1,500 people were urged to take shelter.The island sustained relatively minor damage and became the base for relief efforts on Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.Though the core of the hurricane was expected to remain north of the island, a yellow alert was issued for Martinique due to the likelihood of rough seas.The island dispatched relief supplies and military reinforcements to its neighboring islands of Guadeloupe, Saint Martin.and Saint Barthélemy, which faced a greater risk of a direct impact.\n\nOn September 4, Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency.By September 6, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency had deployed response teams in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.Supplies, including food rations, medical supplies, and blankets, were pre-staged in strategic locations on the islands for distribution.\n\nOn September 5, the Dominican Republic activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage; the United States and Haiti followed suit two days later.According to officials, 11,200 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas prior to the storm\'s arrival.Approximately 7,400 tourists were moved to Santo Domingo, away from beach resorts.In Haiti, government officials and aid organizations struggled with early preparation and evacuation efforts.While some officials blamed reluctance and indifference on the part of the population, others ""admitted they were not prepared for the onslaught and no mandatory evacuation orders were in place ahead of Irma\'s approach.""Local officials contended that they had not received promised funds, supplies, or equipment from the national government.The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti prepared its 1,000 peacekeepers and engineers to assist.\n\nIn the Turks and Caicos, evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas starting September 5. Schools were closed, government buildings were boarded up, and shelters were opened.Officials spread warnings to residents in English, Creole, and Spanish via social media, radio, SMS text, and WhatsApp.In The Bahamas, the government began preparations the week prior to the hurricane\'s arrival, including securing national sports facilities to use as shelters.By September 7, the government had evacuated 1,609 people by air from the southern islands, including 365 from Bimini.Controlled cutting of the power supply to southern and central Bahamian islands was conducted in advance of the storm.Shelters were made available, though usage was low due to most evacuees staying with family on other islands.Of the 2,679 foreign tourists still in The Bahamas on September 7, about 1,200 were being housed at Atlantis Paradise Island, one of the most hurricane-ready structures in the country.\n\nIn Cuba, meteorologists did not initially predict a direct hit.Fuel conservation was enacted in Camagüey Province to ensure that enough would be available during post-storm power outages.The Civil Defense evacuated nearly one million people from low-lying areas, including thousands of Canadian and European tourists in the Jardines del Rey.Dolphins at a Cayo Guillermo resort were evacuated by helicopter.\n\nThe NHC issued several watches and warnings for the Southeastern United States.The first watches and warnings were issued at 15:00 UTC on September 7, which was a hurricane watch from the Jupiter Inlet to Bonita Beach, including the Florida Keys and Lake Okeechobee.The watches and warnings were extended into Georgia and South Carolina on September 9.At 21:00 UTC on that day, the advisories reached their maximum extent, with a hurricane warning covering the entire east coast of the state, the west coast from Indian Pass southward, and the Florida Keys; a hurricane watch was in place from the Florida–Georgia state line to Edisto Beach, South Carolina; and there were two tropical storm warnings, one in Florida from Indian Pass to the Okaloosa–Walton county line and the other from the Florida–Georgia state line to the South Santee River in South Carolina.Watches and warnings were gradually discontinued as Irma moved inland and weakened, with all of them canceled by early on September 12.\n\nOn September 4, Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency.Governor Scott placed 100 members of the Florida National Guard on duty to assist in preparations.All 7,000 troops were ordered to be on duty by September 8.Officials advised residents to stock their hurricane kits.The state coordinated with electrical companies in order for power outages to be restored as quickly as possible, extending resources such as equipment, fuel, and lodging for the approximately 24,000 restoration personnel who had been activated.Governor Scott suspended tolls on all toll roads in Florida, including the turnpike.All state offices in Florida were closed from September 8 to September 11, while public schools, state colleges, and state universities in all 67 counties were closed during the same period.The Florida Department of Education coordinated with school districts as the need for transportation by school buses and opening shelters arose.By September 9, more than 150 state parks were closed.Throughout the state, almost 700 emergency shelters were opened.The shelters collectively housed about 191,764 people, with more than 40% of them staying in a shelter in South Florida.Additionally, more than 60 special needs shelters were opened, which housed more than 5,000 people by September 9.\n\nMany airports across the state, particularly in Central and South Florida, were closed.Nearly 9,000 flights intending to arrive in or depart from Florida were canceled.Along Florida\'s coasts, most seaports were closed or opened with restricted access.For the fifth time in its 45-year history, the Walt Disney World Resort was completely closed due to the storm.Its theme parks, water parks, and Disney Springs were all closed by 9:00 p.m. on September 9 and remained closed until September 12.Other Orlando-area theme parks, including Universal Orlando Resort and SeaWorld Orlando, were also closed.The Kennedy Space Center was closed from September 8 to September 15.\n\nAn estimated 6.5 million Floridians were ordered to evacuate, mostly those living on barrier islands or in coastal areas; in mobile or sub-standard homes; and in low-lying or flood prone areas.Mandatory evacuations were ordered for portions of Brevard, Broward, Citrus, Collier, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Glades, Hendry, Hernando, Indian River, Lee, Martin, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Lucie, Sumter, and Volusia counties.All of Monroe County, where the Florida Keys are located, was placed under a mandatory evacuation.Residents in communities near the southern half of Lake Okeechobee were also ordered to leave.Additionally, voluntary evacuation notices were issued for all or parts of Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Charlotte, Columbia, Desoto, Hardee, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lake, Manatee, Okeechobee, Osceola, and Polk counties.\n\nA record 6.5 million Floridians evacuated, making it the largest evacuation in the state\'s history.Evacuees caused significant traffic congestion on northbound Interstate 95, Interstate 75, and Florida\'s Turnpike, exacerbated by the fact that the entire Florida peninsula was within the cone of uncertainty in the NHC\'s forecast path in the days before the storm, so evacuees from both coasts headed north, as evacuees would not be safer by fleeing to the opposite coast.Fuel was in short supply throughout peninsular Florida during the week before Irma\'s arrival, especially along evacuation routes, leading to hours-long lines at fuel stations and even escorts of fuel trucks by the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nUse of the left shoulder as a lane for moving traffic was allowed on northbound Interstate 75 from Wildwood to the Georgia state line beginning September 8 and on eastbound Interstate 4 from Tampa to State Road 429 near Celebration for a few hours on September 9.It was the first time that the shoulder-use plan, which was introduced at the start of the 2017 hurricane season, was implemented by the state for hurricane evacuations.The shoulder-use plan was implemented in place of labor- and resource-intensive contraflow lane reversal, in which both sides of an interstate highway are used for one direction of traffic.\n\nOfficials from the Environmental Protection Agency, which had been criticized for its response to Hurricane Harvey, took special measures to inspect and secure hazardous materials, especially at Superfund sites.Direct Relief, a disaster relief organization, coordinated with local health centers and provided resources to help facilities on the front lines of Floridian and Puerto Rican communities.\n\nGeorgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency initially for all six coastal counties on September 6, but eventually expanded the declaration to 94 counties south of Atlanta metropolitan area, and then the entire state on September 10.Atlanta was placed under its first-ever tropical storm warning.Governor Deal ordered mandatory evacuations for all areas east of Interstate 95 on September 7, before extending the order to the entirety of Chatham County and low-lying areas west of I-95 on the following day.In total, 540,000 people on the Georgia coast were ordered to leave.Contraflow lane reversal for Interstate 16 took effect on the morning of September 9 from Savannah to Dublin, Georgia.All Georgia state parks were open for free to evacuees, as was the 800-acre camping area at Atlanta Motor Speedway.Reversible HOT lanes on Interstate 75 in Georgia through south metro Atlanta were open 24 hours northbound with no tolls.\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on September 6, with South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster following suit the same day.Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency on September 8 in order to protect Virginia residents and to mobilize resources in support of neighboring states.Officials in New Orleans stated that there would not be much time for preparations if Irma failed to make the projected northward turn, but that South Texas or Florida would not be a good evacuation destination.On September 10, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam issued an executive order allowing medical professionals in other states to practice in Tennessee to aid Hurricane Irma evacuees.This order also allowed pharmacies to give out 14-day supplies of medicine, and gave women and children from outside the state the ability to participate in the Tennessee Department of Health programs.Bristol Motor Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway, and Charlotte Motor Speedway all opened their campgrounds to evacuees free of charge.\n\nIn professional sports, the Miami Dolphins–Tampa Bay Buccaneers game scheduled for September 10 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was postponed to November 19 due to the storm\'s threat.The Dolphins left early for their road game against the Los Angeles Chargers.The Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees moved their September 11–13 series from Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg to Citi Field in Queens.Minor League Baseball\'s Florida State League, Carolina League, and Southern League called off their championship finals and as a result, named their division series winners league co-champions.The Miami FC versus San Francisco Deltas match on September 10 was cancelled so the players and staff could prepare for the storm with their families.The Orlando Pride of the National Women\'s Soccer League rescheduled their September 9 match to September 7. Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer did not have any scheduled home games in September, but was unable to return to training facilities in Orlando due to Hurricane Irma.\n\nIn college football, the UCF Knights-Memphis Tigers game scheduled for September 9 was moved to September 30, replacing UCF\'s game against Maine and Memphis game against Georgia State.UCF also cancelled their game against Georgia Tech on September 16, as UCF\'s stadium hosted the National Guard.The USF Bulls-Connecticut Huskies football game was also cancelled.The Miami Hurricanes–Arkansas State Redwolves game scheduled for September 9 at Centennial Bank Stadium in Arkansas was canceled due to travel concerns for the University of Miami.The Florida Gators-Northern Colorado Bears match in Gainesville scheduled for September 9 was cancelled.The Florida State Seminoles contest against the Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks was canceled on September 8.The Seminoles\' rivalry game with the Hurricanes in Tallahassee, originally scheduled for September 16, was postponed tp October 7.The FIU Panthers game against the Alcorn State Braves was moved up a day and relocated to Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.The Georgia Southern Eagles game against the New Hampshire Wildcats on September 9 was also moved to Legion Field for that day.\n\nAs of September 5, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding was running dangerously low, due to its response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas the previous week, prompting the Trump administration to request an immediate $8 billion in additional funding as Irma approached Florida.Given the rate that current funds are being consumed and the catastrophic damage, the United States Senate almost doubled the requested amount to $15.3 billion, with the understanding that this would only be about 10% of what will be required for responding to Harvey.\n\nHurricane Irma\'s path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating, with landfalls in Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Martin, the Bahamas, Cuba, and the United States, all at major hurricane intensity.Furthermore, the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences.Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria.\n\nThe eyewall of the hurricane moved over Barbuda near its record peak intensity early on September 6; a weather station observed a wind gust of .The same station also recorded a minimum barometric pressure of .The exact state of the island remained unclear for hours after Irma\'s passage, as downed phone lines ceased all communication with nearby islands.Later that afternoon, Prime Minister Gaston Browne surveyed the territory by helicopter, revealing an effectively uninhabitable island.Irma damaged or destroyed 95% of the structures on Barbuda, including its hospital, schools, and both of its hotels; it completely flattened some residential blocks while submerging others.The destruction rendered the island\'s sole airport and much of its infrastructure inoperative—including water and telecommunication services—which further hampered relief efforts.Property damage on Barbuda ranged from $150 million to $300 million.A total of three storm-related deaths were reported on the island.\n\nIn addition to the catastrophic impact on Barbuda\'s human residents, concern turned to the storm\'s effects on the island\'s wildlife.The island\'s only endemic bird, the near-threatened Barbuda warbler, numbered less than 2,000 individuals prior to the hurricane.For some time it was unknown if the warbler survived the hurricane or its aftermath; however within a few months it was confirmed that not only did the species survive, but the most of the birds survived the storm.Barbuda\'s Codrington Lagoon, home to the largest colony of magnificent frigatebirds in the Caribbean, with an estimated 2,500 nesting pairs, was also inundated by the storm surge.\n\nRemaining just outside of Irma\'s strongest windfield, Antigua sustained less severe damage, in the form of leveled roofs and fences, downed power poles and lines, and uprooted trees.Some street flooding also took place in low-lying areas.Three people were treated for minor storm-related injuries.Forensic disaster analysts from the Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM), a Germany-based risk management agency, estimate that economic losses for Antigua and Barbuda will exceed $120 million.\n\nOn the morning of September 6, Irma\'s center crossed the island of Saint Martin while the storm was at peak intensity, sweeping away entire structures, submerging roads and cars, and triggering an island-wide blackout.Irma\'s extreme winds ripped trees out of the ground and sent vehicles and debris from damaged structures scattered across the territory.On the French side of Saint-Martin, entire marinas around Marigot were left in ruins, littered with the stranded remnants of boats that had smashed into each other.A hotel caught on fire, but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze.Another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor.Media images depicted devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds had shattered their windows.Irma killed four people on the French side of the island and injured 50 others, one of whom was in critical condition.As many as 95% of the buildings there were damaged to some degree; 60% of those were totally uninhabitable.Estimates from CEDIM indicate a minimum of $950 million worth of economic losses.Total losses exceeded €3.5 billion (US$4.17 billion).\n\nA similar situation unfolded in Sint Maarten, Saint Martin\'s Dutch half, as intense winds ripped through buildings and lifted vehicles aloft ""as if they were matches"".The hurricane wreaked havoc on Princess Juliana International Airport, with ""huge chunks of the building [strewn] across the runway and a jet bridge snapped in half.""It demolished or severely damaged about 70% of Sint Maarten\'s houses, forcing thousands of residents into public shelters.There were 4 deaths and 23 injuries, 11 of which were serious, in the Dutch territory.Irma is considered the worst natural disaster to hit Sint Maarten; the extent of its damage far exceeded that of any previous hurricane.Total damages were estimated at €2.5 billion (US$2.98 billion).\n\nIrma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the French island of Saint Barthélemy, southeast of Saint Martin.Describing the extent of the destruction, one local compared it to ""a bomb that burned all vegetation,"" while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively ""erased the island from the map"".Violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments, with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation.Streets in the capital of Gustavia were turned into rushing rivers, which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture.The island\'s fire station was inundated with up to of flood waters.With scores of homes and much of the infrastructure destroyed, the majority of the island\'s population was left stranded and without water, electricity or phone service.The associated economic losses could exceed $480 million according to CEDIM\'s analysts.\n\nPreliminary assessments from the French government indicate that Hurricane Irma caused a combined €1.2 billion (US$1.43 billion) in insured losses across the French territories of Saint-Martin and Saint Barts.This total covered private property such as homes, vehicles and businesses (including lost revenue); the extent of the damage to infrastructural and public facilities remains undetermined.Nonetheless, this made Irma one of the costliest natural disasters to hit the French Republic in 50 years.\n\nOn January 30, 2018, roughly five months after Irma, an analysis was published indicating that an anemometer on the island recorded an unofficial gust to before failing.\n\nThe British Overseas Territory of Anguilla saw the eyewall of the storm pass over it on September 6.Many homes and schools were destroyed, and the island\'s only hospital was badly damaged.The devastation was particularly severe in East End, where the winds uprooted scores of trees and power poles and demolished a number of houses.In The Valley, the island\'s capital, the hurricane blew out the windows of government buildings.Rough seas inflicted heavy damage upon several bays and harbors, and a seaside restaurant was completely eradicated.About 90% of roads were left impassable.The island\'s air traffic control tower was damaged, exacerbating the already poor communication with the island.One death was reported on the island.Estimates of losses on the island total at least $190 million.\n\nLarge swells ahead of Irma washed ashore debris and sea life in Castries, Saint Lucia, blocking some roads.Seaside roads were inundated with water.One surfer was killed amid rough surf in Barbados after hitting a reef and breaking his neck.Trees were also destroyed.The hurricane\'s effects, such as violent seas and rattling trees, were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in Guadeloupe.Several houses were damaged.Around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm, leaving several communes in the dark without running water.Overall damage was limited to external parts of houses and trees that were blown onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seas.\n\nSaint Kitts and Nevis endured similar conditions to other islands.Blustery rainstorms triggered scattered power outages and disabled the island\'s water system, but per the International Red Cross, the islands were spared the level of destruction seen elsewhere.Still, Prime Minister Timothy Harris stated that property and infrastructure had sustained ""significant damage.""The Dutch territories of Saba and Sint Eustatius were also struck by the hurricane\'s winds, resulting in infrastructural damage, water shortages and telecommunication outages.Several houses were left uninhabitable.On Saba, the hurricane also defoliated trees and injured a few people.CEDIM\'s analysts expect economic losses of $20–65 million for the two islands.\n\nDamage in the British Virgin Islands was extensive.Numerous buildings and roads were destroyed on the island of Tortola, which bore the brunt of the hurricane\'s core.Four people were confirmed dead.Along Cane Garden Bay, the storm surge submerged several seaside bars and a gas station.Satellite images revealed many of the island\'s residential zones had been left in ruins.The hurricane passed over Necker Island, also causing severe damage and destroying the mansion of Richard Branson.\n\nMost homes and businesses were destroyed on the island of Jost Van Dyke, the smallest of the B.V.I.\'s four main islands.The Governor, Gus Jaspert, who had only been sworn into office 13 days previously, declared a state of emergency - the first time this has ever happened in the Territory.After the storm, restoration of electricity took approximately 5 months.\n\nIrma\'s effects in the U.S. Virgin Islands were most profound on Saint Thomas, where at least of rain fell, and on Saint John.Saint Thomas island suffered widespread structural damage, including to its police station and airport.Patients from the fourth and third floors of Charlotte Amalie\'s hospital had to be relocated to lower floors due to flooding from roof leaks.Three deaths were attributed to Irma on the island.On nearby Saint Croix, there were communication issues and some damage to the infrastructure.Saint John lost access to ferry and cargo services, along with access to the local airport.Due to its normal reliance on electricity from Saint Thomas, the island was left without power.Total damage from the three islands was at least $1.1 billion.\n\nThe hurricane passed north of Puerto Rico, but still caused significant damage to the United States territory.Along the coast, a tide gauge observed waves up to mean higher high water.Much of the main island experienced sustained tropical storm force winds, with a peak sustained wind speed of at a weather station along San Juan Bay, while the same site observed a peak wind gust of .However, on the island of Culebra, a wind gust of was reported.Mainly due to strong winds, approximately 1.1 million out of 1.5 million of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority\'s customers lost electricity.Portions of Puerto Rico received heavy rainfall, with a peak total of in Bayamón, causing seven rivers to reach flood stage, widespread flash flooding, and at least six landslides.\n\nThe most severely affected areas included the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques, as well as the northeastern, northern, and mountainous portions of the main island.On Culebra, the island suffered an almost complete loss of electrical and water services.At least 30 homes on the island were destroyed, while about 30 other experienced substantial damage.High winds also toppled a number of trees.The only telecommunications tower on Culebra sustained damage, cutting off outside communications for several hours.In rural Loíza, 79 homes were destroyed.Throughout Puerto Rico, 781 out of 1,600 telecommunications towers went out of commission, primarily due to power outages.At least 362,000 customers lost water services.Debris, mostly fallen trees, blocked at least 72 roads.Approximately 25% to 30% of banana, coffee, papaya, and plantain crops were damaged by strong winds, with losses to farmers estimated at $30.6 million.Approximately 1,530 homes experienced at least moderate damage, with 1,448 homes moderately damaged, 32 extensively damaged, and 50 completely destroyed.\n\nHurricane Irma was attributed to around $1 billion in damage, and the NHC attributed three fatalities to Irma in Puerto Rico, though four deaths were related to the storm.Two people died due to rainstorms ahead of the hurricane: one man died in Orocovis after falling off his ladder while repairing his roof; another man on the coast in Capitanejo died after being struck by lightning.Three nearby fishermen were burned by the same lightning strike, but survived.Two other people died during the hurricane: a woman died while being evacuated from her house in a wheelchair and fell, hitting her head; another person died in a car accident in Canóvanas.Governor Ricardo Rosselló declared the islands of Culebra and Vieques to be disaster areas.\n\nAlthough spared a direct hit, both the Dominican Republic and Haiti were affected by high winds and heavy rains.A bridge over the Dajabón River connecting the two countries was broken.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, the fishing community of Nagua sustained damage from waves that destroyed homes.55,000 soldiers were deployed to affected areas to help with the clean-up efforts.By the evening of September 7, the government had counted 2,721 damaged homes.\n\nIn Haiti, flooding one meter deep sat in residential neighborhoods in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives.Mudslides, destroyed homes, flooded crops, and infrastructure damage were reported in the northern part of the country.The total expanse of the flooding stretched from Môle-Saint-Nicolas in the west to the eastern border with the Dominican Republic.\n\nOn the evening of September 7, at 7:30 pm AST (23:30 UTC), Hurricane Irma reached the Turks and Caicos Islands.While the eye passed just south of the main islands, crossing over South Caicos and the Ambergris Cays, the most powerful winds on the northern side of the eye swept all of the islands for more than two hours.Communications infrastructure was destroyed.\n\nOn September 8, Minister of Infrastructure Goldray Ewing confirmed that damage to Providenciales was extensive, with the northwestern neighborhood of Blue Hill being ""gone"".The hospital in the capital, Cockburn Town, was heavily damaged.On South Caicos, 75% of roofs were lost.Total damage was estimated at over $500 million.\n\nIn the Bahamas, the eye of the storm passed over Duncan Town, the major settlement of the Ragged Islands chain, on September 8.It also passed ""almost directly over"" Inagua and South Acklins, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.\n\nDamages were largely confined to the southern islands starting the morning of September 8.On Mayaguana and Great Inagua, downed power lines knocked out communications.On Great Inagua, 70% of homes sustained roof damage, and the island\'s school lost its roof entirely.The Morton Salt Company\'s signature production facility, one of the major employers in the country, experienced millions of dollars in damages.The Acklins settlement of Salina Point was cut off from the rest of the island by flooding, while Crooked Island had widespread roof damage.In the northern Bahamas, the worst property damage came on September 10 as the outer bands of the system produced tornadic activity on Grand Bahama and Bimini.Damage and losses across The Bahamas amounted to $135 million.\n\nWhile Irma was making landfall in Florida, the ocean was drawn away from some western shorelines of the Bahamas due to strong easterly winds.\n\nEarly on September 9, Irma made landfall on the Camagüey Archipelago off the northern coast of Cuba, with sustained winds of .The strongest official sustained wind speed was , while the highest wind gust reached ; both were observed near Camila in Ciego de Ávila Province.The weather station at Esmeralda, Camagüey, was damaged, with the wind gauge destroyed.The north coast of Cuba experienced significant coastal flooding due to storm surge and abnormally high tides generated by the storm.Wave heights at Cayo Romano exceeded .Storm surge penetrated as far as inland in some areas of Villa Clara Province.Multiple locations on the island observed at least of rainfall, with a peak total of of precipitation at Topes de Collantes.\n\nA total of 158,554 homes experienced some degree of damage, of which 14,657 were destroyed; approximately 1.9 million people experienced the direct effects of Irma.The storm partially deroofed 103,691 homes, while 23,560 were completely deroofed.Irma damaged or destroyed 980 health facilities and 2,264 schools.Approximately 3.1 million people experienced disruptions to the water supply, while 246,707 people lost telephone service.About of roads were damaged.Crops also suffered extensively, with nearly affected by the storm.Throughout the country, the hurricane inflicted $13.185 billion in damage and killed 10 people, making Irma the costliest tropical cyclone in Cuban history.\n\nThe tourist areas of Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and Cayo Santa María and the nearby town of Caibarién received the brunt of the storm, with waves rolling through town and the characteristic one-story homes completely flooded.The storm most severely Ciego de Ávila and Villa Clara provinces.Flooding worsened as the hurricane moved west, pushing the storm surge along to the regions around Havana.By the afternoon, limited flooding was occurring in Havana, including around the Malecón.Portions of province coastal flooding surpassing that which was experienced during the Storm of the Century in 1993 and Hurricane Wilma in 2005.In the city of Santa Clara, 39 buildings collapsed.Rainfall resulted in several rivers reaching major flood stage.The town of Cabaiguán in Sancti Spíritus Province in particular suffered extensive inland flooding after the Zaza River swelled.\n\nHurricane Irma directly affected a major colony of American flamingos on Cuba\'s northern Cayo Coco.Early reports from Diario de Cuba indicated that several hundred flamingos had been killed by the storm, though other estimates ranged as high as several thousand birds.\n\nHurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida.Except for the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned.Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba, but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys.The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States.After surveying the aftermath of Irma, Florida governor Rick Scott said ""I thought we would see more damage""[on the mainland] but said ""he witnessed devastation in the Keys"".President Donald Trump commented on Twitter that the devastation in some places was ""far greater than anyone thought"".\n\nDamage in the United States was estimated at a minimum of $50 billion.At the time, Irma was the fourth costliest tropical cyclone in the United States, behind hurricanes Sandy in 2012, Harvey earlier that year, and Katrina in 2005.However, later in September 2017, Hurricane Maria became the third costliest United States tropical cyclone, causing Irma to fall to the fifth costliest.At least 92 people, 10 directly and 82 indirectly, died throughout the United States in relation to Irma: 84 in Florida, 3 in Georgia, 3 in South Carolina, and 2 in North Carolina.\n\nIrma struck the state less than two weeks after Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten had caused the worst flooding seen in western Florida in 20 years, which further worsened the impacts in the region.The storm\'s large wind field resulted in strong winds across much of Florida, except for the western Panhandle.The highest reported sustained wind speed was on Marco Island, while the strongest observed wind gust was , recorded near Naples, though wind gusts of likely occurred in the Middle Florida Keys.More than 7.7 million homes and businesses in Florida were left without electricity at some point – approximately 73% of state.Generally heavy amounts of rainfall were recorded to the east of the Irma\'s path, including a peak total of in Fort Pierce.Heavy precipitation – and storm surge, in some instances – overflowed at least 32 rivers and creeks, causing significant flooding, particularly along the St. Johns River and its tributaries.Many homes and businesses suffered damage or destruction, with more than 65,000 structures damaged to some degree in West Central and Southwest Florida alone.Agriculture experienced about $2.5 billion in damage.It was estimated that the cyclone caused at least $50 billion in damage, making Irma the costliest hurricane in Florida history, surpassing Hurricane Andrew, until it was itself surpassed by Hurricane Ian, 5 years later.\n\nThroughout Florida, at least 84 people died in storm-related incidents.About half of the deaths occurred from drowning, trauma, and carbon monoxide poisoning.Broward County had 21 fatalities, the most of any county in Florida.Among those deaths were 12 people at The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, a Hollywood nursing home.The patients died from sweltering heat worsened by the lack of air conditioning.The hurricane also left at least 14 deaths in Monroe County; 6 deaths in Orange County; 5 deaths each in Duval, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties; 4 deaths in both Highlands and Hillsborough counties; 3 deaths in both Marion and Polk counties; 2 deaths each in Collier, Hardee, Leon, Pinellas, St. Lucie, and Taylor counties; and 1 death in Hendry, Lake, Lee, Liberty, Manatee, Nassau, Okeechobee, Pasco, Seminole, St. Johns, and Volusia counties.\n\nWith Irma making landfall in Monroe County as a Category 4 hurricane, the Florida Keys were hardest hit area in the state.Strong winds and storm surge flooding caused major damage to buildings, trailer parks, boats, roads, the electricity supply, mobile phone coverage, internet access, sanitation, the water supply and the fuel supply throughout the island chain.An estimated storm surge occurred at Cudjoe Key, where Irma made landfall.Throughout the island, 625 homes sustained minor damage, 52 sustained major damage, and 81 were demolished.On Big Pine Key, one of the most devastated islands, 633 homes received minor impact, 299 homes received major impact, and 473 homes were completely destroyed.Overall in Monroe County, 27,649 homes experienced some degree of damage, including 1,179 homes being destroyed, 2,977 homes receiving major damage, and 5,361 suffering minor damage.\n\nAfter devastating the Keys, the storm then struck Collier County as a Category 3 hurricane.Several communities in the county suffered extensive damage, especially along the coast.Throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, 65 homes, including 44 mobile homes, were demolished, while 1,008 homes received major damage.Property damages in unincorporated areas alone reach about $320 million.Lee County was lashed by strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused prolonged flooding in some areas.More than 24,000 homes suffered some degree of damage, with almost 3,000 homes receiving major damage and 89 homes being destroyed.Damage in the county totaled about $857 million.\n\nImpact in much of the Miami metropolitan area was generally limited to extensive tree and fence damage, as well as widespread power outages.However, in Miami-Dade County, about 1,000 homes received major damage and about 50% of crops were lost.Storm surge caused coastal flooding from Homestead to Downtown Miami, as well as in portions of Miami Beach.Parts of the Florida Heartland were devastated by high winds and flooding, particularly Hendry and Highlands counties.In the former, which has most citrus trees of any county in Florida, about 60% of orange crops were lost.Throughout Hendry County, a total of 451 homes had minor damage, 131 homes suffered major damage, and 42 others were destroyed.In Highlands County, 13,138 businesses and homes were damaged to some degree, with 144 being destroyed, 963 sustaining major damage, and 2,408 receiving minor damage.In Orange County, wind gusts reached 79 mph at Orlando International Airport.A wind gust of 91 mph was also recorded in Orlando at the top of the Disney Contemporary Resort.Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central Florida left some wind damage and flooding, necessitating evacuations and rescues, including more than 200 people in Orlo Vista after hundreds of homes were flooded.A total of 2,999 business or homes were damaged in Lake County, 7,430 in Seminole County, and 3,457 in Volusia County.Additionally, eight tornadoes touched down in Brevard County, all of which caused damage.\n\nAlong much of the Gulf Coast of Florida, to the north of where Irma made landfall, negative storm surges were observed, with water retracting rather than pushing inland, causing little coastal flooding.However, on the opposite coast, extensive erosion and storm surge flooding occurred in the First Coast, especially in Duval and St. Johns counties.In Duval County, the St. Johns River crested at heights that exceeded records set during Hurricane Dora in 1964.Portions of Jacksonville experienced flooding, particularly the downtown area and the Riverside and San Marco neighborhoods, with about 350 people rescued in those sections of the city.Water reached about high in some homes.The city of Jacksonville suffered about $85 million in damage.\n\nIn St. Johns County, storm surge left extensive damage to oceanfront properties in Ponte Vedra Beach and Vilano Beach, with several becoming uninhabitable.Additionally, some riverfront businesses in St. Augustine\'s historic district were flooded due to storm surge from the Matanzas River.In nearby Clay County, rainfall and storm surge combined to cause extensive flooding along portions of the Black Creek and the St. Johns River, with record high crests at several locations along the former.About 350 people and 75 animals were rescued from floodwaters throughout the county.A total of 275 homes were destroyed, 175 were inflicted major damage, and 124 received minor damage.\n\nThree deaths were reported in Georgia due to falling trees and debris, along with widespread wind damage and power outages throughout the state primarily due to fallen trees.On Tybee Island, as well as St. Simons Island the storm surge caused extensive flooding.The tropical storm also did $54 million in damage in the state.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the third highest storm surge on record was recorded, reaching a height of approximately .By of September 12, almost 100,000 had lost power in Upstate South Carolina.Five people died in storm-related incidents across South Carolina, all from indirect incidents.The tropical storm caused damages totaling $500,000 in the state.\n\nLight damage occurred in other areas, including Tennessee.About 75,000 customers in North Carolina lost power due to Irma.It also caused $600,000 in damages in Alabama.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Irma\'s path through the West Indies and Caribbean, the devastation to roads, harbors and airports significantly impeded the transportation and distribution of relief supplies.Foreign countries moved to provide much of the initial aid.The British, Dutch, French, and United States governments sent warships and planes with supplies and manpower to the region.International leaders, including Dutch King Willem-Alexander and French President Emmanuel Macron, quickly moved to visit affected territories.\n\nSome of the affected countries and territories also offered assistance to each other.Cuba, which sustained extensive damage from the storm, sent 750 health workers to Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, Dominica, and Haiti.Government officials and members of the public in Puerto Rico delivered assistance and evacuated people stranded on other islands.The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services granted special 30-day humanitarian visas for British Virgin Islanders to stay in Puerto Rico.Hundreds of people stranded on Saint Martin were flown to the Dominican Republic on humanitarian grounds.\n\nIn response to Hurricane Jose\'s approach, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a mandatory evacuation on September 9 for any remaining residents on Barbuda.A Miami cargo plane landed on Antigua later that day, carrying over 60 tons (120,000 lbs) of relief supplies for the displaced storm victims—including bottled water, canned food and power generators.\n\nRFA Mounts Bay stationed itself near Anguilla and provided support and relief work to the island with its helicopters and 40 marines and army engineers.The ship delivered 6 tonnes of emergency aid to Anguilla and army engineers repaired a fuel leak at Anguilla\'s main petrol dump, restored power to the island\'s hospital and provided shelters for those left homeless by the hurricane.The ship arrived in the British Virgin Islands on September 8, 2017, to provide emergency relief to the islands, including providing shelters, food and water.HMS Ocean was diverted from the Mediterranean to provide relief from Gibraltar to the affected British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos on September 7, and aid was also supplied by the Department for International Development from their disaster response centre at Kemble Airfield.As part of a £32 million operation named Operation Ruman, nearly 500 UK military personnel with emergency relief were dispatched from RAF Brize Norton.This included the first deployment of No. 38 Expeditionary Air Wing with 3 RAF aircraft; 2 Airbus A400M Atlas and 1 C130J hercules to support relief efforts.\n\nThe British government also drafted 2 members of the UK police calibre into the region on September 10, and 53 police officers were drafted from RAF Brize Norton to the affected British Overseas Territories on September 15 to help maintain order.UK politicians, including the chairs of the foreign affairs and development select committees, criticized both the government\'s preparations for the storm and its response as inadequate.\n\nBy September 12, the Department for International Development had delivered more than 40 tonnes of aid into the region, including into Turks and Caicos, and 1,000 UK military troops were deployed in the region as part of relief efforts.The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, pledged an additional £25 million worth of funding as part of relief efforts in the region on September 13, 2017, and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Boris Johnson, said that a further 250 UK military personnel would be deployed into the area within the next few days.Anguilla\'s Chief Minister, Victor Banks, praised the British government\'s response to the storm and said that Boris Johnson\'s visit to the island ""sends a very positive signal to Anguillans that the British are serious about their response to this very severe hurricane"", but went on to say that the current financial commitment from the UK was not substantial enough.\n\nBy September 15, the United Kingdom had over 70 military personnel and 4 police officers in Anguilla and had delivered 15 tonnes of aid to the island.In the British Virgin Islands, Royal Marines had cleared the airfield so that it was operational for the delivery of aid into the islands, with more than 200 British military personnel and 54 UK police officers on the ground and 8 tonnes of aid delivered to the islands.120 British military personnel were on the ground in Turks and Caicos, and over 150 shelter kits and 720 liters of water were delivered to the islands on September 15.\n\nAmendments to international aid rules by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (or OECD) allowed for the UK government to provide access to £13 billion worth of aid to the affected British Overseas Territories, through the UK\'s Official Development Assistance (ODA) by November 2017.\n\nBy the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage.The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by Irma\'s eye, remained largely inaccessible for days.Assessments showed that 15% of the national telecommunications network had been affected, with at least one tower destroyed.Bahamasair resumed a limited domestic schedule on September 10, with international flights still cancelled due to existing and anticipated destruction at other destinations.\n\nThe worst devastation occurred on Ragged Island, over which Irma\'s eye had directly passed.After days of the National Emergency Management Agency not being able to physically reach the island, officials were finally able to inspect it; they promptly declared it uninhabitable.Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said that it was the worst disaster area he or his officials had ever seen, and that all remaining residents would need to leave, potentially permanently.Business leaders and other officials called for a new long-term development model to shift the population away from such sparsely-settled islands.\n\nOn Grand Bahama and Bimini, where tornadoes associated with Irma touched down on September 10, more than 100 people were left displaced.Infrastructure damage included docks, parks, and the power system.\n\nAside from tangible asset losses, Irma brought significant economic damages.International freight shipping was projected to be offline for a week, and costs for rebuilding supplies were inflated due to demand in the U.S.\n\nSwollen rivers contributed to worsening flooding in the days after the storm system left, resulting in additional evacuations.Officials resorted to using inflatable rafts to access affected areas.The national electrical infrastructure was said to be extensively damaged.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, flooding worsened following Irma\'s departure, leading the number of displaced persons to increase to more than 24,000 by September 8.President Danilo Medina ordered further evacuations due to at-risk dams, while the government banned swimming in rivers and ordered boats kept in port.More than 422,000 people were left without water due to 28 aqueducts being damaged.\n\nIn Haiti, officials stated that losses were greater than they could have been since people largely did not heed early preparation and evacuation warnings.At least 5,000 homes were flooded.One man died trying to cross a flooded river; another went missing and 17 were injured.The trash- and waste-contaminated floodwaters in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives led to fears of cholera outbreaks.Flooding continued to worsen days after the storm, as runoff from the mountains swelled rivers in low-lying farming communities.United Nations peacekeepers from Brazil were able to gain access to the flooded northwest region to provide urgent aid, but non-governmental organizations and Haitian economists warned that the estimated 30,000 victims would need longer-term assistance as well.Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant appointed a government commission to address Irma\'s effects, with Action Against Hunger in charge of humanitarian coordination.\n\nIn the USVI, residents and tourists alike were described as being in a state of traumatic shock.By September 7, the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship had arrived in the USVI to provide supplies, damage assessment, and evacuation assistance.Four additional warships, some of which had already been on their way to Texas to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief, were redirected to the region.At a September 10 news conference, Governor Kenneth Mapp described Irma as a ""horrific disaster"" for which ""[t]here will be no restorations or solutions in days or weeks.""The Federal Emergency Management Agency airlifted in goods for residents, who were subjected to a curfew.Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line agreed to transport tourists to Florida, contingent upon port availability following the state\'s own experience with Irma.\n\nOn Saint John, described as ""perhaps the site of Irma\'s worst devastation on American soil,"" it took six days for an active-theater disaster zone to be established, leading to criticism of the U.S. government response.The National Guard was delayed in reaching Saint John due to the number of overturned boats left in the harbor.The National Guard was brought in to maintain order, while the Coast Guard brought evacuees to cruise ships bound for San Juan and Miami.There was still no electricity on St. John in the middle of October 2017.\n\nBy September 9, more than one million Puerto Ricans were still without power, tens of thousands were without water, and several thousand were still in shelters.Hospitals were operating on generator power.The government was struggling to establish contact with the islands of Culebra and Vieques.By September 10, the main island had recovered enough to serve as a refuge for people stranded on other islands, including 1,200 tourists from Saint Martin and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Airlifts had brought more than 50 patients to Puerto Rico.\n\nFive months after Irma, two-thirds of the hospital beds on Saint Thomas were still unavailable, due to extensive physical damage and staffing shortages.\n\nDamage to Sint Maarten\'s harbour and to Princess Juliana International Airport left the Dutch part of Saint Martin unreachable, although the smaller Grand Case-Espérance Airport on the French side could be reopened by September 7 for supply aid by helicopter and airplane.The French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops on board a CASA/IPTN CN-235 aircraft.\n\nThe following day, the Dutch military was able to airlift dialysis patients off the island while also dropping leaflets to warn islanders about the rapidly approaching Hurricane Jose.Although the airport was closed, 435 students and faculty of the American University of the Caribbean were evacuated by the U.S. military.On September 10, Dutch King Willem-Alexander departed for the region, with intentions to visit Sint Maarten and other affected Dutch territories and commonwealth members.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron followed this announcement by stating his intentions to visit the French part of the island on September 12 in order to bring aid supplies.In response to criticism of the French handling of the disaster, 1,000 troops, police, and other emergency workers were sent to Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.\n\nOn both sides of Saint Martin, desperate conditions combined with food and water shortages in Irma\'s aftermath led to reports of violence, scavenging, and theft.In response, the French government increased its troop deployment to 2,200 and the Dutch government sent more than 600 military and police personnel.\n\nThe day after the hurricane hit Saint Barthelemy the French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops into the reopened Grand Case-Espérance Airport.On September 7 and 9, equipment and personnel were flown from France to Guadeloupe and Martinique.\n\nSporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm.\n\nOn September 11, Florida Governor Rick Scott conducted an aerial tour to survey the damage to the Keys.The Overseas Highway remained closed while authorities assessed the integrity of the 42 bridges along the route.Residents returning to the Keys were faced with a police roadblock, to the south of Florida City.USS Iwo Jima, USS New York and aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were sent to the Keys area to aid with the recovery.\n\nOn September 12, some residents were allowed to return into the Keys as far as Islamorada.Although road damage blocked entry any farther than Islamorada, bridges had been inspected and found safe to Sugarloaf Key.By late on September 12, the Overseas Highway had been repaired and the bridges inspected as safe for first responders to travel to Key West.On September 16, residents were free to return to Marathon.Residents were allowed to return to Key West the following day, although the Keys remained closed to tourists and a checkpoint remained in place in Florida City.\n\nDue mainly to the widespread loss of power, cell phone service was also reduced after battery backup power for cell phone towers ran out and backup generators ran out of fuel.In an impact report by the FCC, as of 11 AM EDT on September 12, 89 of 108 (82%) cell phone towers were non-functioning in Monroe County (Florida Keys), 154 of 212 (73%) were non-functioning in Collier County (Naples), 36 of 46 (78%) were non-functioning in Hendry County, and an additional six counties had 41-60% of cell phone towers not functioning, including Lee County (Fort Myers) and Miami-Dade County.\n\nNOAA released map-format aerial reconnaissance image data of damage from the storm.The imagery featured several areas of Florida: including the Florida Keys, the southwest coast of Florida from Marco Island to Punta Gorda, much of the northeast coast of Florida, and portions of the Jacksonville area.Portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts were also photographed.Additionally, the Sun-Sentinel published before and after photos of several landmarks in the Florida Keys.\n\nIn the days after the hurricane, due to the heavy rainfall, numerous rivers had flooded, including residential areas.Public health risks, such as diarrheal infections and mosquito-borne illnesses, remain from the flooding that resulted in the aftermath of the hurricane.A large concern from flooding is contamination because people become exposed to dirty floodwaters and the potential for contaminated water to enter the local water supply is significant.One example of an illness that can enter the water supply is leptospirosis, which is rat urine carries into the floodwaters.Untreated exposure to leptospirosis can cause kidney damage, meningitis, and liver failure.Noroviruses and other infections are also a risk.\n\nFollowing Irma\'s passage, a hand-carved wooden canoe was discovered on the banks of the Indian River and could be several hundred years old.The state has removed the canoe for examination and safe keeping.\n\nDue to Irma\'s and Hurricane Harvey\'s impact in Florida and Texas, U.S. employment declined in September 2017 for the first time since September 2010.The leisure and hospitality industries were especially hard hit, losing 111,000 jobs in September.\n\nIrma set multiple records for intensity, especially at easterly longitudes, time spent at such an intensity, and its intensity at landfall.When Irma reached Category 5 intensity with winds of at 11:45 UTC on September 5 at 57.7°W, it became the easternmost Atlantic hurricane of this strength on record, surpassing Hurricane David of 1979, later beaten by Hurricane Lorenzo 2 years later.By 00:15 UTC on September 6, Irma reached peak intensity with () winds and a minimum pressure of .This ties it with Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and Hurricane Rita of 2005 as the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed.Only five other Atlantic hurricanes have been recorded with wind speeds higher than Irma: Hurricane Allen of 1980, which had maximum sustained winds of , and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Gilbert of 1988, Hurricane Wilma of 2005, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, all of which had peak winds of .At the time, Irma was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; later surpassed by Hurricane Dorian, and was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007.In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category 5 strength winds, and the third-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, with a value of 64.9 units.Only the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane and Hurricane Ivan in 2004 achieved higher values.\n\nOn September 6, Irma made landfall on the islands of Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Virgin Gorda at peak strength.This ties Irma with cyclones Monica of 2006 and Winston of 2016, and typhoons Zeb of 1998 and Megi of 2010 as the seventh-strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall globally – in terms of sustained winds – trailing only Typhoon Goni of 2020 which bore winds of at landfall, Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 and Typhoon Meranti of 2016, which bore winds of at landfall, and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Typhoon Joan of 1959, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, which bore winds of at landfall.Irma is second to the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin, and is the first hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic at Category 5 status since Felix in 2007.Irma is the first recorded Category 5 hurricane to affect the northern Leeward Islands, and was one of the worst storms to hit the region on record, along with Hurricane Donna in 1960 and Hurricane Luis in 1995.In addition, Irma is only the second hurricane on record to make landfall in Cuba at Category 5 intensity, with the other being a hurricane in 1924.Furthermore, when Irma made landfall on Barbuda, Saint Martin, Virgin Gorda, and Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane, it became one of only two recorded Atlantic storms to make landfall in multiple nations at this strength; the other was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which struck both Eleuthera and the United States as a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nIrma made landfall in the Florida Keys with winds of and a pressure of , making it the strongest hurricane to strike Florida in terms of wind speed since Charley in 2004, and the most intense to strike the state in terms of barometric pressure since Andrew in 1992.In the span of two weeks, two Category 4 hurricanes—Harvey and Irma—struck the continental United States, the first time on record two Atlantic tropical cyclones of such strength made landfall on the country in the same hurricane season.This also marked only the third occurrence of two consecutive Atlantic storms making landfall in the United States as major hurricanes.The other two instances were the Great Charleston and Cheniere Caminada hurricanes in 1893, and hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne in 2004.\n\nBecause of the extensive damage and loss of life the hurricane caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Irma from its rotating naming lists in April 2018, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane.It was replaced with Idalia for the 2023 season.\n\nWeather of 2017 Tropical cyclones in 2017 List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes Operation RUMAN – UK military-civil disaster relief response to Hurricane Irma.List of Cuba hurricanes List

one in Barbados; three in Barbuda; four in the British Virgin Islands; 10 in Cuba; 11 in the French West Indies; one in Haiti; three in Puerto Rico; four on the Dutch side of Sint Maarten; 92 in the contiguous United States, and four in the U.S. Virgin Islands.Hurricane Irma was the top Google searched term in the U.S. and globally in 2017.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa on August 26.The tropical wave moved off the coast of the continent late on August 27.Throughout the next two days, showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low-pressure area, as the system passed just south of and then through the Cape Verde Islands on August 29.Around 00:00 UTC on the following day, the system developed into a tropical depression just west of the Cape Verde Islands.Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Irma, based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates.With warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, strengthening was anticipated, with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier air.\n\nThe nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow, as an anticyclone became established over the system, with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images.Early on August 31, shortly after the development of a central dense overcast (CDO) and an eye feature, Irma underwent rapid intensification, becoming a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 UTC and then a Category 3 hurricane, becoming a major hurricane – around 00:00 UTC on September 1.Within a 48-hour period, the hurricane\'s intensity had increased by .On September 2, a ship passed to the west of the center of Irma, recording maximum winds of , which indicated that the eye of Irma remained compact.A strong high pressure system to the north of Irma caused the storm to move west-southwestward between September 2 and September 4.The first aircraft reconnaissance mission departed from Barbados on the afternoon of September 3, discovering an eye in diameter and surface winds of .\n\nOn September 4, after moving into more favorable conditions, Irma strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane.As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by 12:00 UTC on the following day, with winds of .The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at near 18:00 UTC on September 5. Irma acquired annular characteristics around this time, with the storm exhibiting a large, symmetric CDO and an impressive satellite appearance.Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern Leeward Islands.Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of Barbuda at peak intensity, with the storm\'s central minimum pressure having bottomed out at – this was the lowest in the Atlantic since Dean in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of .Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15 UTC on Sint Maarten, and at 16:30 UTC on Virgin Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands, though the storm\'s central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall.\n\nAs the hurricane moved away from the Virgin Islands late on September 6, observations from reconnaissance flights, as well as Doppler radar in San Juan, Puerto Rico, indicated an elliptical eye and double eyewalls.Late on September 6, the cyclone passed about north of Puerto Rico.Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of Hispaniola throughout the day on September 7.After beginning an eyewall replacement cycle, Irma weakened to a Category 4 hurricane as it passed south of the Turks and Caicos Islands early on September 8.This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category 5 intensity, the second-longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above – behind only the 1932 Cuba hurricane.At 05:00 UTC on September 8, Irma made landfall on the island of Little Inagua in the Bahamas with sustained winds of .The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a subtropical ridge to its north.Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category 5 intensity at 18:00 UTC that day east of Cuba as deep convection became more pronounced and organized.The hurricane then made landfall in Cayo Romano, Cuba, at 03:00 UTC on September 9, with winds of .This made Irma only the second Category 5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the 1924 Cuba hurricane.As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category 2 storm later on September 9.\n\nAfter slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards Florida around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental United States.Moving over the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, Irma quickly restrengthened to a Category 4 hurricane at 06:00 UTC on September 10, as deep convection improved and the eye became better defined.In addition, Irma\'s wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of and gale-force winds spanning in diameter.The cyclone made landfall in Cudjoe Key, Florida, at 13:00 UTC on September 10, at Category 4 intensity, with winds of .Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category 3 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30 UTC, in Marco Island, Florida, with sustained winds of .Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category 3 intensity hours after landfall.Passing east of Tampa as a weakening Category 1 hurricane around 06:00 UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation – though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds.The system finally weakened to a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC that day as it entered southern Georgia, while acquiring some extratropical characteristics.At 06:00 UTC on September 12, Irma degenerated to a remnant low just as it entered Alabama, as most of the deep convection had diminished.The remnants persisted for another day or so before dissipating over Missouri on September 13.\n\nGiven that Irma\'s forecast track was along much of the Caribbean island chain, hurricane warnings were issued for the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and parts of Hispaniola on September 5.\n\nIn Antigua and Barbuda, residents safeguarded their homes and cleaned up their properties in anticipation of strong winds.Emergency crews were put on standby at public shelters and hospitals by September 5 to assist with any evacuations.Expecting a direct hit, more than half of the residents on Barbuda took shelter, and relief supplies were preemptively mobilized.The National Emergency Management Organization on Saint Lucia urged small craft operators and swimmers to be mindful of forecasts for high surf.Small Craft Warnings and High Surf Advisories were hoisted for Dominica, where residents were urged to remain vigilant of the potential for high waves, landslides, and flooding.\n\nIn Guadeloupe, low-lying and cliff-edge homes were evacuated at the threat of flooding and erosion.Schools and public businesses closed on September 5 and 6.Hospitals stocked up on three days\' worth of supplies and checked the functionality of their generators.Of the island\'s 32 communes, 22 activated their emergency plans; 1,500 people were urged to take shelter.The island sustained relatively minor damage and became the base for relief efforts on Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.Though the core of the hurricane was expected to remain north of the island, a yellow alert was issued for Martinique due to the likelihood of rough seas.The island dispatched relief supplies and military reinforcements to its neighboring islands of Guadeloupe, Saint Martin.and Saint Barthélemy, which faced a greater risk of a direct impact.\n\nOn September 4, Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency.By September 6, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency had deployed response teams in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.Supplies, including food rations, medical supplies, and blankets, were pre-staged in strategic locations on the islands for distribution.\n\nOn September 5, the Dominican Republic activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage; the United States and Haiti followed suit two days later.According to officials, 11,200 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas prior to the storm\'s arrival.Approximately 7,400 tourists were moved to Santo Domingo, away from beach resorts.In Haiti, government officials and aid organizations struggled with early preparation and evacuation efforts.While some officials blamed reluctance and indifference on the part of the population, others ""admitted they were not prepared for the onslaught and no mandatory evacuation orders were in place ahead of Irma\'s approach.""Local officials contended that they had not received promised funds, supplies, or equipment from the national government.The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti prepared its 1,000 peacekeepers and engineers to assist.\n\nIn the Turks and Caicos, evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas starting September 5. Schools were closed, government buildings were boarded up, and shelters were opened.Officials spread warnings to residents in English, Creole, and Spanish via social media, radio, SMS text, and WhatsApp.In The Bahamas, the government began preparations the week prior to the hurricane\'s arrival, including securing national sports facilities to use as shelters.By September 7, the government had evacuated 1,609 people by air from the southern islands, including 365 from Bimini.Controlled cutting of the power supply to southern and central Bahamian islands was conducted in advance of the storm.Shelters were made available, though usage was low due to most evacuees staying with family on other islands.Of the 2,679 foreign tourists still in The Bahamas on September 7, about 1,200 were being housed at Atlantis Paradise Island, one of the most hurricane-ready structures in the country.\n\nIn Cuba, meteorologists did not initially predict a direct hit.Fuel conservation was enacted in Camagüey Province to ensure that enough would be available during post-storm power outages.The Civil Defense evacuated nearly one million people from low-lying areas, including thousands of Canadian and European tourists in the Jardines del Rey.Dolphins at a Cayo Guillermo resort were evacuated by helicopter.\n\nThe NHC issued several watches and warnings for the Southeastern United States.The first watches and warnings were issued at 15:00 UTC on September 7, which was a hurricane watch from the Jupiter Inlet to Bonita Beach, including the Florida Keys and Lake Okeechobee.The watches and warnings were extended into Georgia and South Carolina on September 9.At 21:00 UTC on that day, the advisories reached their maximum extent, with a hurricane warning covering the entire east coast of the state, the west coast from Indian Pass southward, and the Florida Keys; a hurricane watch was in place from the Florida–Georgia state line to Edisto Beach, South Carolina; and there were two tropical storm warnings, one in Florida from Indian Pass to the Okaloosa–Walton county line and the other from the Florida–Georgia state line to the South Santee River in South Carolina.Watches and warnings were gradually discontinued as Irma moved inland and weakened, with all of them canceled by early on September 12.\n\nOn September 4, Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency.Governor Scott placed 100 members of the Florida National Guard on duty to assist in preparations.All 7,000 troops were ordered to be on duty by September 8.Officials advised residents to stock their hurricane kits.The state coordinated with electrical companies in order for power outages to be restored as quickly as possible, extending resources such as equipment, fuel, and lodging for the approximately 24,000 restoration personnel who had been activated.Governor Scott suspended tolls on all toll roads in Florida, including the turnpike.All state offices in Florida were closed from September 8 to September 11, while public schools, state colleges, and state universities in all 67 counties were closed during the same period.The Florida Department of Education coordinated with school districts as the need for transportation by school buses and opening shelters arose.By September 9, more than 150 state parks were closed.Throughout the state, almost 700 emergency shelters were opened.The shelters collectively housed about 191,764 people, with more than 40% of them staying in a shelter in South Florida.Additionally, more than 60 special needs shelters were opened, which housed more than 5,000 people by September 9.\n\nMany airports across the state, particularly in Central and South Florida, were closed.Nearly 9,000 flights intending to arrive in or depart from Florida were canceled.Along Florida\'s coasts, most seaports were closed or opened with restricted access.For the fifth time in its 45-year history, the Walt Disney World Resort was completely closed due to the storm.Its theme parks, water parks, and Disney Springs were all closed by 9:00 p.m. on September 9 and remained closed until September 12.Other Orlando-area theme parks, including Universal Orlando Resort and SeaWorld Orlando, were also closed.The Kennedy Space Center was closed from September 8 to September 15.\n\nAn estimated 6.5 million Floridians were ordered to evacuate, mostly those living on barrier islands or in coastal areas; in mobile or sub-standard homes; and in low-lying or flood prone areas.Mandatory evacuations were ordered for portions of Brevard, Broward, Citrus, Collier, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Glades, Hendry, Hernando, Indian River, Lee, Martin, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Lucie, Sumter, and Volusia counties.All of Monroe County, where the Florida Keys are located, was placed under a mandatory evacuation.Residents in communities near the southern half of Lake Okeechobee were also ordered to leave.Additionally, voluntary evacuation notices were issued for all or parts of Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Charlotte, Columbia, Desoto, Hardee, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lake, Manatee, Okeechobee, Osceola, and Polk counties.\n\nA record 6.5 million Floridians evacuated, making it the largest evacuation in the state\'s history.Evacuees caused significant traffic congestion on northbound Interstate 95, Interstate 75, and Florida\'s Turnpike, exacerbated by the fact that the entire Florida peninsula was within the cone of uncertainty in the NHC\'s forecast path in the days before the storm, so evacuees from both coasts headed north, as evacuees would not be safer by fleeing to the opposite coast.Fuel was in short supply throughout peninsular Florida during the week before Irma\'s arrival, especially along evacuation routes, leading to hours-long lines at fuel stations and even escorts of fuel trucks by the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nUse of the left shoulder as a lane for moving traffic was allowed on northbound Interstate 75 from Wildwood to the Georgia state line beginning September 8 and on eastbound Interstate 4 from Tampa to State Road 429 near Celebration for a few hours on September 9.It was the first time that the shoulder-use plan, which was introduced at the start of the 2017 hurricane season, was implemented by the state for hurricane evacuations.The shoulder-use plan was implemented in place of labor- and resource-intensive contraflow lane reversal, in which both sides of an interstate highway are used for one direction of traffic.\n\nOfficials from the Environmental Protection Agency, which had been criticized for its response to Hurricane Harvey, took special measures to inspect and secure hazardous materials, especially at Superfund sites.Direct Relief, a disaster relief organization, coordinated with local health centers and provided resources to help facilities on the front lines of Floridian and Puerto Rican communities.\n\nGeorgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency initially for all six coastal counties on September 6, but eventually expanded the declaration to 94 counties south of Atlanta metropolitan area, and then the entire state on September 10.Atlanta was placed under its first-ever tropical storm warning.Governor Deal ordered mandatory evacuations for all areas east of Interstate 95 on September 7, before extending the order to the entirety of Chatham County and low-lying areas west of I-95 on the following day.In total, 540,000 people on the Georgia coast were ordered to leave.Contraflow lane reversal for Interstate 16 took effect on the morning of September 9 from Savannah to Dublin, Georgia.All Georgia state parks were open for free to evacuees, as was the 800-acre camping area at Atlanta Motor Speedway.Reversible HOT lanes on Interstate 75 in Georgia through south metro Atlanta were open 24 hours northbound with no tolls.\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on September 6, with South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster following suit the same day.Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency on September 8 in order to protect Virginia residents and to mobilize resources in support of neighboring states.Officials in New Orleans stated that there would not be much time for preparations if Irma failed to make the projected northward turn, but that South Texas or Florida would not be a good evacuation destination.On September 10, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam issued an executive order allowing medical professionals in other states to practice in Tennessee to aid Hurricane Irma evacuees.This order also allowed pharmacies to give out 14-day supplies of medicine, and gave women and children from outside the state the ability to participate in the Tennessee Department of Health programs.Bristol Motor Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway, and Charlotte Motor Speedway all opened their campgrounds to evacuees free of charge.\n\nIn professional sports, the Miami Dolphins–Tampa Bay Buccaneers game scheduled for September 10 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was postponed to November 19 due to the storm\'s threat.The Dolphins left early for their road game against the Los Angeles Chargers.The Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees moved their September 11–13 series from Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg to Citi Field in Queens.Minor League Baseball\'s Florida State League, Carolina League, and Southern League called off their championship finals and as a result, named their division series winners league co-champions.The Miami FC versus San Francisco Deltas match on September 10 was cancelled so the players and staff could prepare for the storm with their families.The Orlando Pride of the National Women\'s Soccer League rescheduled their September 9 match to September 7. Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer did not have any scheduled home games in September, but was unable to return to training facilities in Orlando due to Hurricane Irma.\n\nIn college football, the UCF Knights-Memphis Tigers game scheduled for September 9 was moved to September 30, replacing UCF\'s game against Maine and Memphis game against Georgia State.UCF also cancelled their game against Georgia Tech on September 16, as UCF\'s stadium hosted the National Guard.The USF Bulls-Connecticut Huskies football game was also cancelled.The Miami Hurricanes–Arkansas State Redwolves game scheduled for September 9 at Centennial Bank Stadium in Arkansas was canceled due to travel concerns for the University of Miami.The Florida Gators-Northern Colorado Bears match in Gainesville scheduled for September 9 was cancelled.The Florida State Seminoles contest against the Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks was canceled on September 8.The Seminoles\' rivalry game with the Hurricanes in Tallahassee, originally scheduled for September 16, was postponed tp October 7.The FIU Panthers game against the Alcorn State Braves was moved up a day and relocated to Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.The Georgia Southern Eagles game against the New Hampshire Wildcats on September 9 was also moved to Legion Field for that day.\n\nAs of September 5, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding was running dangerously low, due to its response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas the previous week, prompting the Trump administration to request an immediate $8 billion in additional funding as Irma approached Florida.Given the rate that current funds are being consumed and the catastrophic damage, the United States Senate almost doubled the requested amount to $15.3 billion, with the understanding that this would only be about 10% of what will be required for responding to Harvey.\n\nHurricane Irma\'s path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating, with landfalls in Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Martin, the Bahamas, Cuba, and the United States, all at major hurricane intensity.Furthermore, the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences.Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria.\n\nThe eyewall of the hurricane moved over Barbuda near its record peak intensity early on September 6; a weather station observed a wind gust of .The same station also recorded a minimum barometric pressure of .The exact state of the island remained unclear for hours after Irma\'s passage, as downed phone lines ceased all communication with nearby islands.Later that afternoon, Prime Minister Gaston Browne surveyed the territory by helicopter, revealing an effectively uninhabitable island.Irma damaged or destroyed 95% of the structures on Barbuda, including its hospital, schools, and both of its hotels; it completely flattened some residential blocks while submerging others.The destruction rendered the island\'s sole airport and much of its infrastructure inoperative—including water and telecommunication services—which further hampered relief efforts.Property damage on Barbuda ranged from $150 million to $300 million.A total of three storm-related deaths were reported on the island.\n\nIn addition to the catastrophic impact on Barbuda\'s human residents, concern turned to the storm\'s effects on the island\'s wildlife.The island\'s only endemic bird, the near-threatened Barbuda warbler, numbered less than 2,000 individuals prior to the hurricane.For some time it was unknown if the warbler survived the hurricane or its aftermath; however within a few months it was confirmed that not only did the species survive, but the most of the birds survived the storm.Barbuda\'s Codrington Lagoon, home to the largest colony of magnificent frigatebirds in the Caribbean, with an estimated 2,500 nesting pairs, was also inundated by the storm surge.\n\nRemaining just outside of Irma\'s strongest windfield, Antigua sustained less severe damage, in the form of leveled roofs and fences, downed power poles and lines, and uprooted trees.Some street flooding also took place in low-lying areas.Three people were treated for minor storm-related injuries.Forensic disaster analysts from the Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM), a Germany-based risk management agency, estimate that economic losses for Antigua and Barbuda will exceed $120 million.\n\nOn the morning of September 6, Irma\'s center crossed the island of Saint Martin while the storm was at peak intensity, sweeping away entire structures, submerging roads and cars, and triggering an island-wide blackout.Irma\'s extreme winds ripped trees out of the ground and sent vehicles and debris from damaged structures scattered across the territory.On the French side of Saint-Martin, entire marinas around Marigot were left in ruins, littered with the stranded remnants of boats that had smashed into each other.A hotel caught on fire, but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze.Another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor.Media images depicted devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds had shattered their windows.Irma killed four people on the French side of the island and injured 50 others, one of whom was in critical condition.As many as 95% of the buildings there were damaged to some degree; 60% of those were totally uninhabitable.Estimates from CEDIM indicate a minimum of $950 million worth of economic losses.Total losses exceeded €3.5 billion (US$4.17 billion).\n\nA similar situation unfolded in Sint Maarten, Saint Martin\'s Dutch half, as intense winds ripped through buildings and lifted vehicles aloft ""as if they were matches"".The hurricane wreaked havoc on Princess Juliana International Airport, with ""huge chunks of the building [strewn] across the runway and a jet bridge snapped in half.""It demolished or severely damaged about 70% of Sint Maarten\'s houses, forcing thousands of residents into public shelters.There were 4 deaths and 23 injuries, 11 of which were serious, in the Dutch territory.Irma is considered the worst natural disaster to hit Sint Maarten; the extent of its damage far exceeded that of any previous hurricane.Total damages were estimated at €2.5 billion (US$2.98 billion).\n\nIrma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the French island of Saint Barthélemy, southeast of Saint Martin.Describing the extent of the destruction, one local compared it to ""a bomb that burned all vegetation,"" while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively ""erased the island from the map"".Violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments, with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation.Streets in the capital of Gustavia were turned into rushing rivers, which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture.The island\'s fire station was inundated with up to of flood waters.With scores of homes and much of the infrastructure destroyed, the majority of the island\'s population was left stranded and without water, electricity or phone service.The associated economic losses could exceed $480 million according to CEDIM\'s analysts.\n\nPreliminary assessments from the French government indicate that Hurricane Irma caused a combined €1.2 billion (US$1.43 billion) in insured losses across the French territories of Saint-Martin and Saint Barts.This total covered private property such as homes, vehicles and businesses (including lost revenue); the extent of the damage to infrastructural and public facilities remains undetermined.Nonetheless, this made Irma one of the costliest natural disasters to hit the French Republic in 50 years.\n\nOn January 30, 2018, roughly five months after Irma, an analysis was published indicating that an anemometer on the island recorded an unofficial gust to before failing.\n\nThe British Overseas Territory of Anguilla saw the eyewall of the storm pass over it on September 6.Many homes and schools were destroyed, and the island\'s only hospital was badly damaged.The devastation was particularly severe in East End, where the winds uprooted scores of trees and power poles and demolished a number of houses.In The Valley, the island\'s capital, the hurricane blew out the windows of government buildings.Rough seas inflicted heavy damage upon several bays and harbors, and a seaside restaurant was completely eradicated.About 90% of roads were left impassable.The island\'s air traffic control tower was damaged, exacerbating the already poor communication with the island.One death was reported on the island.Estimates of losses on the island total at least $190 million.\n\nLarge swells ahead of Irma washed ashore debris and sea life in Castries, Saint Lucia, blocking some roads.Seaside roads were inundated with water.One surfer was killed amid rough surf in Barbados after hitting a reef and breaking his neck.Trees were also destroyed.The hurricane\'s effects, such as violent seas and rattling trees, were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in Guadeloupe.Several houses were damaged.Around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm, leaving several communes in the dark without running water.Overall damage was limited to external parts of houses and trees that were blown onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seas.\n\nSaint Kitts and Nevis endured similar conditions to other islands.Blustery rainstorms triggered scattered power outages and disabled the island\'s water system, but per the International Red Cross, the islands were spared the level of destruction seen elsewhere.Still, Prime Minister Timothy Harris stated that property and infrastructure had sustained ""significant damage.""The Dutch territories of Saba and Sint Eustatius were also struck by the hurricane\'s winds, resulting in infrastructural damage, water shortages and telecommunication outages.Several houses were left uninhabitable.On Saba, the hurricane also defoliated trees and injured a few people.CEDIM\'s analysts expect economic losses of $20–65 million for the two islands.\n\nDamage in the British Virgin Islands was extensive.Numerous buildings and roads were destroyed on the island of Tortola, which bore the brunt of the hurricane\'s core.Four people were confirmed dead.Along Cane Garden Bay, the storm surge submerged several seaside bars and a gas station.Satellite images revealed many of the island\'s residential zones had been left in ruins.The hurricane passed over Necker Island, also causing severe damage and destroying the mansion of Richard Branson.\n\nMost homes and businesses were destroyed on the island of Jost Van Dyke, the smallest of the B.V.I.\'s four main islands.The Governor, Gus Jaspert, who had only been sworn into office 13 days previously, declared a state of emergency - the first time this has ever happened in the Territory.After the storm, restoration of electricity took approximately 5 months.\n\nIrma\'s effects in the U.S. Virgin Islands were most profound on Saint Thomas, where at least of rain fell, and on Saint John.Saint Thomas island suffered widespread structural damage, including to its police station and airport.Patients from the fourth and third floors of Charlotte Amalie\'s hospital had to be relocated to lower floors due to flooding from roof leaks.Three deaths were attributed to Irma on the island.On nearby Saint Croix, there were communication issues and some damage to the infrastructure.Saint John lost access to ferry and cargo services, along with access to the local airport.Due to its normal reliance on electricity from Saint Thomas, the island was left without power.Total damage from the three islands was at least $1.1 billion.\n\nThe hurricane passed north of Puerto Rico, but still caused significant damage to the United States territory.Along the coast, a tide gauge observed waves up to mean higher high water.Much of the main island experienced sustained tropical storm force winds, with a peak sustained wind speed of at a weather station along San Juan Bay, while the same site observed a peak wind gust of .However, on the island of Culebra, a wind gust of was reported.Mainly due to strong winds, approximately 1.1 million out of 1.5 million of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority\'s customers lost electricity.Portions of Puerto Rico received heavy rainfall, with a peak total of in Bayamón, causing seven rivers to reach flood stage, widespread flash flooding, and at least six landslides.\n\nThe most severely affected areas included the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques, as well as the northeastern, northern, and mountainous portions of the main island.On Culebra, the island suffered an almost complete loss of electrical and water services.At least 30 homes on the island were destroyed, while about 30 other experienced substantial damage.High winds also toppled a number of trees.The only telecommunications tower on Culebra sustained damage, cutting off outside communications for several hours.In rural Loíza, 79 homes were destroyed.Throughout Puerto Rico, 781 out of 1,600 telecommunications towers went out of commission, primarily due to power outages.At least 362,000 customers lost water services.Debris, mostly fallen trees, blocked at least 72 roads.Approximately 25% to 30% of banana, coffee, papaya, and plantain crops were damaged by strong winds, with losses to farmers estimated at $30.6 million.Approximately 1,530 homes experienced at least moderate damage, with 1,448 homes moderately damaged, 32 extensively damaged, and 50 completely destroyed.\n\nHurricane Irma was attributed to around $1 billion in damage, and the NHC attributed three fatalities to Irma in Puerto Rico, though four deaths were related to the storm.Two people died due to rainstorms ahead of the hurricane: one man died in Orocovis after falling off his ladder while repairing his roof; another man on the coast in Capitanejo died after being struck by lightning.Three nearby fishermen were burned by the same lightning strike, but survived.Two other people died during the hurricane: a woman died while being evacuated from her house in a wheelchair and fell, hitting her head; another person died in a car accident in Canóvanas.Governor Ricardo Rosselló declared the islands of Culebra and Vieques to be disaster areas.\n\nAlthough spared a direct hit, both the Dominican Republic and Haiti were affected by high winds and heavy rains.A bridge over the Dajabón River connecting the two countries was broken.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, the fishing community of Nagua sustained damage from waves that destroyed homes.55,000 soldiers were deployed to affected areas to help with the clean-up efforts.By the evening of September 7, the government had counted 2,721 damaged homes.\n\nIn Haiti, flooding one meter deep sat in residential neighborhoods in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives.Mudslides, destroyed homes, flooded crops, and infrastructure damage were reported in the northern part of the country.The total expanse of the flooding stretched from Môle-Saint-Nicolas in the west to the eastern border with the Dominican Republic.\n\nOn the evening of September 7, at 7:30 pm AST (23:30 UTC), Hurricane Irma reached the Turks and Caicos Islands.While the eye passed just south of the main islands, crossing over South Caicos and the Ambergris Cays, the most powerful winds on the northern side of the eye swept all of the islands for more than two hours.Communications infrastructure was destroyed.\n\nOn September 8, Minister of Infrastructure Goldray Ewing confirmed that damage to Providenciales was extensive, with the northwestern neighborhood of Blue Hill being ""gone"".The hospital in the capital, Cockburn Town, was heavily damaged.On South Caicos, 75% of roofs were lost.Total damage was estimated at over $500 million.\n\nIn the Bahamas, the eye of the storm passed over Duncan Town, the major settlement of the Ragged Islands chain, on September 8.It also passed ""almost directly over"" Inagua and South Acklins, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.\n\nDamages were largely confined to the southern islands starting the morning of September 8.On Mayaguana and Great Inagua, downed power lines knocked out communications.On Great Inagua, 70% of homes sustained roof damage, and the island\'s school lost its roof entirely.The Morton Salt Company\'s signature production facility, one of the major employers in the country, experienced millions of dollars in damages.The Acklins settlement of Salina Point was cut off from the rest of the island by flooding, while Crooked Island had widespread roof damage.In the northern Bahamas, the worst property damage came on September 10 as the outer bands of the system produced tornadic activity on Grand Bahama and Bimini.Damage and losses across The Bahamas amounted to $135 million.\n\nWhile Irma was making landfall in Florida, the ocean was drawn away from some western shorelines of the Bahamas due to strong easterly winds.\n\nEarly on September 9, Irma made landfall on the Camagüey Archipelago off the northern coast of Cuba, with sustained winds of .The strongest official sustained wind speed was , while the highest wind gust reached ; both were observed near Camila in Ciego de Ávila Province.The weather station at Esmeralda, Camagüey, was damaged, with the wind gauge destroyed.The north coast of Cuba experienced significant coastal flooding due to storm surge and abnormally high tides generated by the storm.Wave heights at Cayo Romano exceeded .Storm surge penetrated as far as inland in some areas of Villa Clara Province.Multiple locations on the island observed at least of rainfall, with a peak total of of precipitation at Topes de Collantes.\n\nA total of 158,554 homes experienced some degree of damage, of which 14,657 were destroyed; approximately 1.9 million people experienced the direct effects of Irma.The storm partially deroofed 103,691 homes, while 23,560 were completely deroofed.Irma damaged or destroyed 980 health facilities and 2,264 schools.Approximately 3.1 million people experienced disruptions to the water supply, while 246,707 people lost telephone service.About of roads were damaged.Crops also suffered extensively, with nearly affected by the storm.Throughout the country, the hurricane inflicted $13.185 billion in damage and killed 10 people, making Irma the costliest tropical cyclone in Cuban history.\n\nThe tourist areas of Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and Cayo Santa María and the nearby town of Caibarién received the brunt of the storm, with waves rolling through town and the characteristic one-story homes completely flooded.The storm most severely Ciego de Ávila and Villa Clara provinces.Flooding worsened as the hurricane moved west, pushing the storm surge along to the regions around Havana.By the afternoon, limited flooding was occurring in Havana, including around the Malecón.Portions of province coastal flooding surpassing that which was experienced during the Storm of the Century in 1993 and Hurricane Wilma in 2005.In the city of Santa Clara, 39 buildings collapsed.Rainfall resulted in several rivers reaching major flood stage.The town of Cabaiguán in Sancti Spíritus Province in particular suffered extensive inland flooding after the Zaza River swelled.\n\nHurricane Irma directly affected a major colony of American flamingos on Cuba\'s northern Cayo Coco.Early reports from Diario de Cuba indicated that several hundred flamingos had been killed by the storm, though other estimates ranged as high as several thousand birds.\n\nHurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida.Except for the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned.Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba, but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys.The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States.After surveying the aftermath of Irma, Florida governor Rick Scott said ""I thought we would see more damage""[on the mainland] but said ""he witnessed devastation in the Keys"".President Donald Trump commented on Twitter that the devastation in some places was ""far greater than anyone thought"".\n\nDamage in the United States was estimated at a minimum of $50 billion.At the time, Irma was the fourth costliest tropical cyclone in the United States, behind hurricanes Sandy in 2012, Harvey earlier that year, and Katrina in 2005.However, later in September 2017, Hurricane Maria became the third costliest United States tropical cyclone, causing Irma to fall to the fifth costliest.At least 92 people, 10 directly and 82 indirectly, died throughout the United States in relation to Irma: 84 in Florida, 3 in Georgia, 3 in South Carolina, and 2 in North Carolina.\n\nIrma struck the state less than two weeks after Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten had caused the worst flooding seen in western Florida in 20 years, which further worsened the impacts in the region.The storm\'s large wind field resulted in strong winds across much of Florida, except for the western Panhandle.The highest reported sustained wind speed was on Marco Island, while the strongest observed wind gust was , recorded near Naples, though wind gusts of likely occurred in the Middle Florida Keys.More than 7.7 million homes and businesses in Florida were left without electricity at some point – approximately 73% of state.Generally heavy amounts of rainfall were recorded to the east of the Irma\'s path, including a peak total of in Fort Pierce.Heavy precipitation – and storm surge, in some instances – overflowed at least 32 rivers and creeks, causing significant flooding, particularly along the St. Johns River and its tributaries.Many homes and businesses suffered damage or destruction, with more than 65,000 structures damaged to some degree in West Central and Southwest Florida alone.Agriculture experienced about $2.5 billion in damage.It was estimated that the cyclone caused at least $50 billion in damage, making Irma the costliest hurricane in Florida history, surpassing Hurricane Andrew, until it was itself surpassed by Hurricane Ian, 5 years later.\n\nThroughout Florida, at least 84 people died in storm-related incidents.About half of the deaths occurred from drowning, trauma, and carbon monoxide poisoning.Broward County had 21 fatalities, the most of any county in Florida.Among those deaths were 12 people at The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, a Hollywood nursing home.The patients died from sweltering heat worsened by the lack of air conditioning.The hurricane also left at least 14 deaths in Monroe County; 6 deaths in Orange County; 5 deaths each in Duval, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties; 4 deaths in both Highlands and Hillsborough counties; 3 deaths in both Marion and Polk counties; 2 deaths each in Collier, Hardee, Leon, Pinellas, St. Lucie, and Taylor counties; and 1 death in Hendry, Lake, Lee, Liberty, Manatee, Nassau, Okeechobee, Pasco, Seminole, St. Johns, and Volusia counties.\n\nWith Irma making landfall in Monroe County as a Category 4 hurricane, the Florida Keys were hardest hit area in the state.Strong winds and storm surge flooding caused major damage to buildings, trailer parks, boats, roads, the electricity supply, mobile phone coverage, internet access, sanitation, the water supply and the fuel supply throughout the island chain.An estimated storm surge occurred at Cudjoe Key, where Irma made landfall.Throughout the island, 625 homes sustained minor damage, 52 sustained major damage, and 81 were demolished.On Big Pine Key, one of the most devastated islands, 633 homes received minor impact, 299 homes received major impact, and 473 homes were completely destroyed.Overall in Monroe County, 27,649 homes experienced some degree of damage, including 1,179 homes being destroyed, 2,977 homes receiving major damage, and 5,361 suffering minor damage.\n\nAfter devastating the Keys, the storm then struck Collier County as a Category 3 hurricane.Several communities in the county suffered extensive damage, especially along the coast.Throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, 65 homes, including 44 mobile homes, were demolished, while 1,008 homes received major damage.Property damages in unincorporated areas alone reach about $320 million.Lee County was lashed by strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused prolonged flooding in some areas.More than 24,000 homes suffered some degree of damage, with almost 3,000 homes receiving major damage and 89 homes being destroyed.Damage in the county totaled about $857 million.\n\nImpact in much of the Miami metropolitan area was generally limited to extensive tree and fence damage, as well as widespread power outages.However, in Miami-Dade County, about 1,000 homes received major damage and about 50% of crops were lost.Storm surge caused coastal flooding from Homestead to Downtown Miami, as well as in portions of Miami Beach.Parts of the Florida Heartland were devastated by high winds and flooding, particularly Hendry and Highlands counties.In the former, which has most citrus trees of any county in Florida, about 60% of orange crops were lost.Throughout Hendry County, a total of 451 homes had minor damage, 131 homes suffered major damage, and 42 others were destroyed.In Highlands County, 13,138 businesses and homes were damaged to some degree, with 144 being destroyed, 963 sustaining major damage, and 2,408 receiving minor damage.In Orange County, wind gusts reached 79 mph at Orlando International Airport.A wind gust of 91 mph was also recorded in Orlando at the top of the Disney Contemporary Resort.Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central Florida left some wind damage and flooding, necessitating evacuations and rescues, including more than 200 people in Orlo Vista after hundreds of homes were flooded.A total of 2,999 business or homes were damaged in Lake County, 7,430 in Seminole County, and 3,457 in Volusia County.Additionally, eight tornadoes touched down in Brevard County, all of which caused damage.\n\nAlong much of the Gulf Coast of Florida, to the north of where Irma made landfall, negative storm surges were observed, with water retracting rather than pushing inland, causing little coastal flooding.However, on the opposite coast, extensive erosion and storm surge flooding occurred in the First Coast, especially in Duval and St. Johns counties.In Duval County, the St. Johns River crested at heights that exceeded records set during Hurricane Dora in 1964.Portions of Jacksonville experienced flooding, particularly the downtown area and the Riverside and San Marco neighborhoods, with about 350 people rescued in those sections of the city.Water reached about high in some homes.The city of Jacksonville suffered about $85 million in damage.\n\nIn St. Johns County, storm surge left extensive damage to oceanfront properties in Ponte Vedra Beach and Vilano Beach, with several becoming uninhabitable.Additionally, some riverfront businesses in St. Augustine\'s historic district were flooded due to storm surge from the Matanzas River.In nearby Clay County, rainfall and storm surge combined to cause extensive flooding along portions of the Black Creek and the St. Johns River, with record high crests at several locations along the former.About 350 people and 75 animals were rescued from floodwaters throughout the county.A total of 275 homes were destroyed, 175 were inflicted major damage, and 124 received minor damage.\n\nThree deaths were reported in Georgia due to falling trees and debris, along with widespread wind damage and power outages throughout the state primarily due to fallen trees.On Tybee Island, as well as St. Simons Island the storm surge caused extensive flooding.The tropical storm also did $54 million in damage in the state.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the third highest storm surge on record was recorded, reaching a height of approximately .By of September 12, almost 100,000 had lost power in Upstate South Carolina.Five people died in storm-related incidents across South Carolina, all from indirect incidents.The tropical storm caused damages totaling $500,000 in the state.\n\nLight damage occurred in other areas, including Tennessee.About 75,000 customers in North Carolina lost power due to Irma.It also caused $600,000 in damages in Alabama.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Irma\'s path through the West Indies and Caribbean, the devastation to roads, harbors and airports significantly impeded the transportation and distribution of relief supplies.Foreign countries moved to provide much of the initial aid.The British, Dutch, French, and United States governments sent warships and planes with supplies and manpower to the region.International leaders, including Dutch King Willem-Alexander and French President Emmanuel Macron, quickly moved to visit affected territories.\n\nSome of the affected countries and territories also offered assistance to each other.Cuba, which sustained extensive damage from the storm, sent 750 health workers to Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, Dominica, and Haiti.Government officials and members of the public in Puerto Rico delivered assistance and evacuated people stranded on other islands.The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services granted special 30-day humanitarian visas for British Virgin Islanders to stay in Puerto Rico.Hundreds of people stranded on Saint Martin were flown to the Dominican Republic on humanitarian grounds.\n\nIn response to Hurricane Jose\'s approach, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a mandatory evacuation on September 9 for any remaining residents on Barbuda.A Miami cargo plane landed on Antigua later that day, carrying over 60 tons (120,000 lbs) of relief supplies for the displaced storm victims—including bottled water, canned food and power generators.\n\nRFA Mounts Bay stationed itself near Anguilla and provided support and relief work to the island with its helicopters and 40 marines and army engineers.The ship delivered 6 tonnes of emergency aid to Anguilla and army engineers repaired a fuel leak at Anguilla\'s main petrol dump, restored power to the island\'s hospital and provided shelters for those left homeless by the hurricane.The ship arrived in the British Virgin Islands on September 8, 2017, to provide emergency relief to the islands, including providing shelters, food and water.HMS Ocean was diverted from the Mediterranean to provide relief from Gibraltar to the affected British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos on September 7, and aid was also supplied by the Department for International Development from their disaster response centre at Kemble Airfield.As part of a £32 million operation named Operation Ruman, nearly 500 UK military personnel with emergency relief were dispatched from RAF Brize Norton.This included the first deployment of No. 38 Expeditionary Air Wing with 3 RAF aircraft; 2 Airbus A400M Atlas and 1 C130J hercules to support relief efforts.\n\nThe British government also drafted 2 members of the UK police calibre into the region on September 10, and 53 police officers were drafted from RAF Brize Norton to the affected British Overseas Territories on September 15 to help maintain order.UK politicians, including the chairs of the foreign affairs and development select committees, criticized both the government\'s preparations for the storm and its response as inadequate.\n\nBy September 12, the Department for International Development had delivered more than 40 tonnes of aid into the region, including into Turks and Caicos, and 1,000 UK military troops were deployed in the region as part of relief efforts.The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, pledged an additional £25 million worth of funding as part of relief efforts in the region on September 13, 2017, and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Boris Johnson, said that a further 250 UK military personnel would be deployed into the area within the next few days.Anguilla\'s Chief Minister, Victor Banks, praised the British government\'s response to the storm and said that Boris Johnson\'s visit to the island ""sends a very positive signal to Anguillans that the British are serious about their response to this very severe hurricane"", but went on to say that the current financial commitment from the UK was not substantial enough.\n\nBy September 15, the United Kingdom had over 70 military personnel and 4 police officers in Anguilla and had delivered 15 tonnes of aid to the island.In the British Virgin Islands, Royal Marines had cleared the airfield so that it was operational for the delivery of aid into the islands, with more than 200 British military personnel and 54 UK police officers on the ground and 8 tonnes of aid delivered to the islands.120 British military personnel were on the ground in Turks and Caicos, and over 150 shelter kits and 720 liters of water were delivered to the islands on September 15.\n\nAmendments to international aid rules by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (or OECD) allowed for the UK government to provide access to £13 billion worth of aid to the affected British Overseas Territories, through the UK\'s Official Development Assistance (ODA) by November 2017.\n\nBy the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage.The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by Irma\'s eye, remained largely inaccessible for days.Assessments showed that 15% of the national telecommunications network had been affected, with at least one tower destroyed.Bahamasair resumed a limited domestic schedule on September 10, with international flights still cancelled due to existing and anticipated destruction at other destinations.\n\nThe worst devastation occurred on Ragged Island, over which Irma\'s eye had directly passed.After days of the National Emergency Management Agency not being able to physically reach the island, officials were finally able to inspect it; they promptly declared it uninhabitable.Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said that it was the worst disaster area he or his officials had ever seen, and that all remaining residents would need to leave, potentially permanently.Business leaders and other officials called for a new long-term development model to shift the population away from such sparsely-settled islands.\n\nOn Grand Bahama and Bimini, where tornadoes associated with Irma touched down on September 10, more than 100 people were left displaced.Infrastructure damage included docks, parks, and the power system.\n\nAside from tangible asset losses, Irma brought significant economic damages.International freight shipping was projected to be offline for a week, and costs for rebuilding supplies were inflated due to demand in the U.S.\n\nSwollen rivers contributed to worsening flooding in the days after the storm system left, resulting in additional evacuations.Officials resorted to using inflatable rafts to access affected areas.The national electrical infrastructure was said to be extensively damaged.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, flooding worsened following Irma\'s departure, leading the number of displaced persons to increase to more than 24,000 by September 8.President Danilo Medina ordered further evacuations due to at-risk dams, while the government banned swimming in rivers and ordered boats kept in port.More than 422,000 people were left without water due to 28 aqueducts being damaged.\n\nIn Haiti, officials stated that losses were greater than they could have been since people largely did not heed early preparation and evacuation warnings.At least 5,000 homes were flooded.One man died trying to cross a flooded river; another went missing and 17 were injured.The trash- and waste-contaminated floodwaters in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives led to fears of cholera outbreaks.Flooding continued to worsen days after the storm, as runoff from the mountains swelled rivers in low-lying farming communities.United Nations peacekeepers from Brazil were able to gain access to the flooded northwest region to provide urgent aid, but non-governmental organizations and Haitian economists warned that the estimated 30,000 victims would need longer-term assistance as well.Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant appointed a government commission to address Irma\'s effects, with Action Against Hunger in charge of humanitarian coordination.\n\nIn the USVI, residents and tourists alike were described as being in a state of traumatic shock.By September 7, the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship had arrived in the USVI to provide supplies, damage assessment, and evacuation assistance.Four additional warships, some of which had already been on their way to Texas to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief, were redirected to the region.At a September 10 news conference, Governor Kenneth Mapp described Irma as a ""horrific disaster"" for which ""[t]here will be no restorations or solutions in days or weeks.""The Federal Emergency Management Agency airlifted in goods for residents, who were subjected to a curfew.Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line agreed to transport tourists to Florida, contingent upon port availability following the state\'s own experience with Irma.\n\nOn Saint John, described as ""perhaps the site of Irma\'s worst devastation on American soil,"" it took six days for an active-theater disaster zone to be established, leading to criticism of the U.S. government response.The National Guard was delayed in reaching Saint John due to the number of overturned boats left in the harbor.The National Guard was brought in to maintain order, while the Coast Guard brought evacuees to cruise ships bound for San Juan and Miami.There was still no electricity on St. John in the middle of October 2017.\n\nBy September 9, more than one million Puerto Ricans were still without power, tens of thousands were without water, and several thousand were still in shelters.Hospitals were operating on generator power.The government was struggling to establish contact with the islands of Culebra and Vieques.By September 10, the main island had recovered enough to serve as a refuge for people stranded on other islands, including 1,200 tourists from Saint Martin and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Airlifts had brought more than 50 patients to Puerto Rico.\n\nFive months after Irma, two-thirds of the hospital beds on Saint Thomas were still unavailable, due to extensive physical damage and staffing shortages.\n\nDamage to Sint Maarten\'s harbour and to Princess Juliana International Airport left the Dutch part of Saint Martin unreachable, although the smaller Grand Case-Espérance Airport on the French side could be reopened by September 7 for supply aid by helicopter and airplane.The French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops on board a CASA/IPTN CN-235 aircraft.\n\nThe following day, the Dutch military was able to airlift dialysis patients off the island while also dropping leaflets to warn islanders about the rapidly approaching Hurricane Jose.Although the airport was closed, 435 students and faculty of the American University of the Caribbean were evacuated by the U.S. military.On September 10, Dutch King Willem-Alexander departed for the region, with intentions to visit Sint Maarten and other affected Dutch territories and commonwealth members.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron followed this announcement by stating his intentions to visit the French part of the island on September 12 in order to bring aid supplies.In response to criticism of the French handling of the disaster, 1,000 troops, police, and other emergency workers were sent to Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.\n\nOn both sides of Saint Martin, desperate conditions combined with food and water shortages in Irma\'s aftermath led to reports of violence, scavenging, and theft.In response, the French government increased its troop deployment to 2,200 and the Dutch government sent more than 600 military and police personnel.\n\nThe day after the hurricane hit Saint Barthelemy the French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops into the reopened Grand Case-Espérance Airport.On September 7 and 9, equipment and personnel were flown from France to Guadeloupe and Martinique.\n\nSporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm.\n\nOn September 11, Florida Governor Rick Scott conducted an aerial tour to survey the damage to the Keys.The Overseas Highway remained closed while authorities assessed the integrity of the 42 bridges along the route.Residents returning to the Keys were faced with a police roadblock, to the south of Florida City.USS Iwo Jima, USS New York and aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were sent to the Keys area to aid with the recovery.\n\nOn September 12, some residents were allowed to return into the Keys as far as Islamorada.Although road damage blocked entry any farther than Islamorada, bridges had been inspected and found safe to Sugarloaf Key.By late on September 12, the Overseas Highway had been repaired and the bridges inspected as safe for first responders to travel to Key West.On September 16, residents were free to return to Marathon.Residents were allowed to return to Key West the following day, although the Keys remained closed to tourists and a checkpoint remained in place in Florida City.\n\nDue mainly to the widespread loss of power, cell phone service was also reduced after battery backup power for cell phone towers ran out and backup generators ran out of fuel.In an impact report by the FCC, as of 11 AM EDT on September 12, 89 of 108 (82%) cell phone towers were non-functioning in Monroe County (Florida Keys), 154 of 212 (73%) were non-functioning in Collier County (Naples), 36 of 46 (78%) were non-functioning in Hendry County, and an additional six counties had 41-60% of cell phone towers not functioning, including Lee County (Fort Myers) and Miami-Dade County.\n\nNOAA released map-format aerial reconnaissance image data of damage from the storm.The imagery featured several areas of Florida: including the Florida Keys, the southwest coast of Florida from Marco Island to Punta Gorda, much of the northeast coast of Florida, and portions of the Jacksonville area.Portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts were also photographed.Additionally, the Sun-Sentinel published before and after photos of several landmarks in the Florida Keys.\n\nIn the days after the hurricane, due to the heavy rainfall, numerous rivers had flooded, including residential areas.Public health risks, such as diarrheal infections and mosquito-borne illnesses, remain from the flooding that resulted in the aftermath of the hurricane.A large concern from flooding is contamination because people become exposed to dirty floodwaters and the potential for contaminated water to enter the local water supply is significant.One example of an illness that can enter the water supply is leptospirosis, which is rat urine carries into the floodwaters.Untreated exposure to leptospirosis can cause kidney damage, meningitis, and liver failure.Noroviruses and other infections are also a risk.\n\nFollowing Irma\'s passage, a hand-carved wooden canoe was discovered on the banks of the Indian River and could be several hundred years old.The state has removed the canoe for examination and safe keeping.\n\nDue to Irma\'s and Hurricane Harvey\'s impact in Florida and Texas, U.S. employment declined in September 2017 for the first time since September 2010.The leisure and hospitality industries were especially hard hit, losing 111,000 jobs in September.\n\nIrma set multiple records for intensity, especially at easterly longitudes, time spent at such an intensity, and its intensity at landfall.When Irma reached Category 5 intensity with winds of at 11:45 UTC on September 5 at 57.7°W, it became the easternmost Atlantic hurricane of this strength on record, surpassing Hurricane David of 1979, later beaten by Hurricane Lorenzo 2 years later.By 00:15 UTC on September 6, Irma reached peak intensity with () winds and a minimum pressure of .This ties it with Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and Hurricane Rita of 2005 as the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed.Only five other Atlantic hurricanes have been recorded with wind speeds higher than Irma: Hurricane Allen of 1980, which had maximum sustained winds of , and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Gilbert of 1988, Hurricane Wilma of 2005, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, all of which had peak winds of .At the time, Irma was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; later surpassed by Hurricane Dorian, and was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007.In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category 5 strength winds, and the third-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, with a value of 64.9 units.Only the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane and Hurricane Ivan in 2004 achieved higher values.\n\nOn September 6, Irma made landfall on the islands of Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Virgin Gorda at peak strength.This ties Irma with cyclones Monica of 2006 and Winston of 2016, and typhoons Zeb of 1998 and Megi of 2010 as the seventh-strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall globally – in terms of sustained winds – trailing only Typhoon Goni of 2020 which bore winds of at landfall, Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 and Typhoon Meranti of 2016, which bore winds of at landfall, and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Typhoon Joan of 1959, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, which bore winds of at landfall.Irma is second to the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin, and is the first hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic at Category 5 status since Felix in 2007.Irma is the first recorded Category 5 hurricane to affect the northern Leeward Islands, and was one of the worst storms to hit the region on record, along with Hurricane Donna in 1960 and Hurricane Luis in 1995.In addition, Irma is only the second hurricane on record to make landfall in Cuba at Category 5 intensity, with the other being a hurricane in 1924.Furthermore, when Irma made landfall on Barbuda, Saint Martin, Virgin Gorda, and Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane, it became one of only two recorded Atlantic storms to make landfall in multiple nations at this strength; the other was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which struck both Eleuthera and the United States as a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nIrma made landfall in the Florida Keys with winds of and a pressure of , making it the strongest hurricane to strike Florida in terms of wind speed since Charley in 2004, and the most intense to strike the state in terms of barometric pressure since Andrew in 1992.In the span of two weeks, two Category 4 hurricanes—Harvey and Irma—struck the continental United States, the first time on record two Atlantic tropical cyclones of such strength made landfall on the country in the same hurricane season.This also marked only the third occurrence of two consecutive Atlantic storms making landfall in the United States as major hurricanes.The other two instances were the Great Charleston and Cheniere Caminada hurricanes in 1893, and hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne in 2004.\n\nBecause of the extensive damage and loss of life the hurricane caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Irma from its rotating naming lists in April 2018, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane.It was replaced with Idalia for the 2023

one in Barbados; three in Barbuda; four in the British Virgin Islands; 10 in Cuba; 11 in the French West Indies; one in Haiti; three in Puerto Rico; four on the Dutch side of Sint Maarten; 92 in the contiguous United States, and four in the U.S. Virgin Islands.Hurricane Irma was the top Google searched term in the U.S. and globally in 2017.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa on August 26.The tropical wave moved off the coast of the continent late on August 27.Throughout the next two days, showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low-pressure area, as the system passed just south of and then through the Cape Verde Islands on August 29.Around 00:00 UTC on the following day, the system developed into a tropical depression just west of the Cape Verde Islands.Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Irma, based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates.With warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, strengthening was anticipated, with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier air.\n\nThe nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow, as an anticyclone became established over the system, with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images.Early on August 31, shortly after the development of a central dense overcast (CDO) and an eye feature, Irma underwent rapid intensification, becoming a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 UTC and then a Category 3 hurricane, becoming a major hurricane – around 00:00 UTC on September 1.Within a 48-hour period, the hurricane\'s intensity had increased by .On September 2, a ship passed to the west of the center of Irma, recording maximum winds of , which indicated that the eye of Irma remained compact.A strong high pressure system to the north of Irma caused the storm to move west-southwestward between September 2 and September 4.The first aircraft reconnaissance mission departed from Barbados on the afternoon of September 3, discovering an eye in diameter and surface winds of .\n\nOn September 4, after moving into more favorable conditions, Irma strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane.As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by 12:00 UTC on the following day, with winds of .The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at near 18:00 UTC on September 5. Irma acquired annular characteristics around this time, with the storm exhibiting a large, symmetric CDO and an impressive satellite appearance.Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern Leeward Islands.Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of Barbuda at peak intensity, with the storm\'s central minimum pressure having bottomed out at – this was the lowest in the Atlantic since Dean in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of .Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15 UTC on Sint Maarten, and at 16:30 UTC on Virgin Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands, though the storm\'s central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall.\n\nAs the hurricane moved away from the Virgin Islands late on September 6, observations from reconnaissance flights, as well as Doppler radar in San Juan, Puerto Rico, indicated an elliptical eye and double eyewalls.Late on September 6, the cyclone passed about north of Puerto Rico.Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of Hispaniola throughout the day on September 7.After beginning an eyewall replacement cycle, Irma weakened to a Category 4 hurricane as it passed south of the Turks and Caicos Islands early on September 8.This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category 5 intensity, the second-longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above – behind only the 1932 Cuba hurricane.At 05:00 UTC on September 8, Irma made landfall on the island of Little Inagua in the Bahamas with sustained winds of .The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a subtropical ridge to its north.Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category 5 intensity at 18:00 UTC that day east of Cuba as deep convection became more pronounced and organized.The hurricane then made landfall in Cayo Romano, Cuba, at 03:00 UTC on September 9, with winds of .This made Irma only the second Category 5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the 1924 Cuba hurricane.As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category 2 storm later on September 9.\n\nAfter slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards Florida around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental United States.Moving over the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, Irma quickly restrengthened to a Category 4 hurricane at 06:00 UTC on September 10, as deep convection improved and the eye became better defined.In addition, Irma\'s wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of and gale-force winds spanning in diameter.The cyclone made landfall in Cudjoe Key, Florida, at 13:00 UTC on September 10, at Category 4 intensity, with winds of .Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category 3 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30 UTC, in Marco Island, Florida, with sustained winds of .Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category 3 intensity hours after landfall.Passing east of Tampa as a weakening Category 1 hurricane around 06:00 UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation – though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds.The system finally weakened to a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC that day as it entered southern Georgia, while acquiring some extratropical characteristics.At 06:00 UTC on September 12, Irma degenerated to a remnant low just as it entered Alabama, as most of the deep convection had diminished.The remnants persisted for another day or so before dissipating over Missouri on September 13.\n\nGiven that Irma\'s forecast track was along much of the Caribbean island chain, hurricane warnings were issued for the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and parts of Hispaniola on September 5.\n\nIn Antigua and Barbuda, residents safeguarded their homes and cleaned up their properties in anticipation of strong winds.Emergency crews were put on standby at public shelters and hospitals by September 5 to assist with any evacuations.Expecting a direct hit, more than half of the residents on Barbuda took shelter, and relief supplies were preemptively mobilized.The National Emergency Management Organization on Saint Lucia urged small craft operators and swimmers to be mindful of forecasts for high surf.Small Craft Warnings and High Surf Advisories were hoisted for Dominica, where residents were urged to remain vigilant of the potential for high waves, landslides, and flooding.\n\nIn Guadeloupe, low-lying and cliff-edge homes were evacuated at the threat of flooding and erosion.Schools and public businesses closed on September 5 and 6.Hospitals stocked up on three days\' worth of supplies and checked the functionality of their generators.Of the island\'s 32 communes, 22 activated their emergency plans; 1,500 people were urged to take shelter.The island sustained relatively minor damage and became the base for relief efforts on Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.Though the core of the hurricane was expected to remain north of the island, a yellow alert was issued for Martinique due to the likelihood of rough seas.The island dispatched relief supplies and military reinforcements to its neighboring islands of Guadeloupe, Saint Martin.and Saint Barthélemy, which faced a greater risk of a direct impact.\n\nOn September 4, Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency.By September 6, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency had deployed response teams in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.Supplies, including food rations, medical supplies, and blankets, were pre-staged in strategic locations on the islands for distribution.\n\nOn September 5, the Dominican Republic activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage; the United States and Haiti followed suit two days later.According to officials, 11,200 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas prior to the storm\'s arrival.Approximately 7,400 tourists were moved to Santo Domingo, away from beach resorts.In Haiti, government officials and aid organizations struggled with early preparation and evacuation efforts.While some officials blamed reluctance and indifference on the part of the population, others ""admitted they were not prepared for the onslaught and no mandatory evacuation orders were in place ahead of Irma\'s approach.""Local officials contended that they had not received promised funds, supplies, or equipment from the national government.The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti prepared its 1,000 peacekeepers and engineers to assist.\n\nIn the Turks and Caicos, evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas starting September 5. Schools were closed, government buildings were boarded up, and shelters were opened.Officials spread warnings to residents in English, Creole, and Spanish via social media, radio, SMS text, and WhatsApp.In The Bahamas, the government began preparations the week prior to the hurricane\'s arrival, including securing national sports facilities to use as shelters.By September 7, the government had evacuated 1,609 people by air from the southern islands, including 365 from Bimini.Controlled cutting of the power supply to southern and central Bahamian islands was conducted in advance of the storm.Shelters were made available, though usage was low due to most evacuees staying with family on other islands.Of the 2,679 foreign tourists still in The Bahamas on September 7, about 1,200 were being housed at Atlantis Paradise Island, one of the most hurricane-ready structures in the country.\n\nIn Cuba, meteorologists did not initially predict a direct hit.Fuel conservation was enacted in Camagüey Province to ensure that enough would be available during post-storm power outages.The Civil Defense evacuated nearly one million people from low-lying areas, including thousands of Canadian and European tourists in the Jardines del Rey.Dolphins at a Cayo Guillermo resort were evacuated by helicopter.\n\nThe NHC issued several watches and warnings for the Southeastern United States.The first watches and warnings were issued at 15:00 UTC on September 7, which was a hurricane watch from the Jupiter Inlet to Bonita Beach, including the Florida Keys and Lake Okeechobee.The watches and warnings were extended into Georgia and South Carolina on September 9.At 21:00 UTC on that day, the advisories reached their maximum extent, with a hurricane warning covering the entire east coast of the state, the west coast from Indian Pass southward, and the Florida Keys; a hurricane watch was in place from the Florida–Georgia state line to Edisto Beach, South Carolina; and there were two tropical storm warnings, one in Florida from Indian Pass to the Okaloosa–Walton county line and the other from the Florida–Georgia state line to the South Santee River in South Carolina.Watches and warnings were gradually discontinued as Irma moved inland and weakened, with all of them canceled by early on September 12.\n\nOn September 4, Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency.Governor Scott placed 100 members of the Florida National Guard on duty to assist in preparations.All 7,000 troops were ordered to be on duty by September 8.Officials advised residents to stock their hurricane kits.The state coordinated with electrical companies in order for power outages to be restored as quickly as possible, extending resources such as equipment, fuel, and lodging for the approximately 24,000 restoration personnel who had been activated.Governor Scott suspended tolls on all toll roads in Florida, including the turnpike.All state offices in Florida were closed from September 8 to September 11, while public schools, state colleges, and state universities in all 67 counties were closed during the same period.The Florida Department of Education coordinated with school districts as the need for transportation by school buses and opening shelters arose.By September 9, more than 150 state parks were closed.Throughout the state, almost 700 emergency shelters were opened.The shelters collectively housed about 191,764 people, with more than 40% of them staying in a shelter in South Florida.Additionally, more than 60 special needs shelters were opened, which housed more than 5,000 people by September 9.\n\nMany airports across the state, particularly in Central and South Florida, were closed.Nearly 9,000 flights intending to arrive in or depart from Florida were canceled.Along Florida\'s coasts, most seaports were closed or opened with restricted access.For the fifth time in its 45-year history, the Walt Disney World Resort was completely closed due to the storm.Its theme parks, water parks, and Disney Springs were all closed by 9:00 p.m. on September 9 and remained closed until September 12.Other Orlando-area theme parks, including Universal Orlando Resort and SeaWorld Orlando, were also closed.The Kennedy Space Center was closed from September 8 to September 15.\n\nAn estimated 6.5 million Floridians were ordered to evacuate, mostly those living on barrier islands or in coastal areas; in mobile or sub-standard homes; and in low-lying or flood prone areas.Mandatory evacuations were ordered for portions of Brevard, Broward, Citrus, Collier, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Glades, Hendry, Hernando, Indian River, Lee, Martin, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Lucie, Sumter, and Volusia counties.All of Monroe County, where the Florida Keys are located, was placed under a mandatory evacuation.Residents in communities near the southern half of Lake Okeechobee were also ordered to leave.Additionally, voluntary evacuation notices were issued for all or parts of Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Charlotte, Columbia, Desoto, Hardee, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lake, Manatee, Okeechobee, Osceola, and Polk counties.\n\nA record 6.5 million Floridians evacuated, making it the largest evacuation in the state\'s history.Evacuees caused significant traffic congestion on northbound Interstate 95, Interstate 75, and Florida\'s Turnpike, exacerbated by the fact that the entire Florida peninsula was within the cone of uncertainty in the NHC\'s forecast path in the days before the storm, so evacuees from both coasts headed north, as evacuees would not be safer by fleeing to the opposite coast.Fuel was in short supply throughout peninsular Florida during the week before Irma\'s arrival, especially along evacuation routes, leading to hours-long lines at fuel stations and even escorts of fuel trucks by the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nUse of the left shoulder as a lane for moving traffic was allowed on northbound Interstate 75 from Wildwood to the Georgia state line beginning September 8 and on eastbound Interstate 4 from Tampa to State Road 429 near Celebration for a few hours on September 9.It was the first time that the shoulder-use plan, which was introduced at the start of the 2017 hurricane season, was implemented by the state for hurricane evacuations.The shoulder-use plan was implemented in place of labor- and resource-intensive contraflow lane reversal, in which both sides of an interstate highway are used for one direction of traffic.\n\nOfficials from the Environmental Protection Agency, which had been criticized for its response to Hurricane Harvey, took special measures to inspect and secure hazardous materials, especially at Superfund sites.Direct Relief, a disaster relief organization, coordinated with local health centers and provided resources to help facilities on the front lines of Floridian and Puerto Rican communities.\n\nGeorgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency initially for all six coastal counties on September 6, but eventually expanded the declaration to 94 counties south of Atlanta metropolitan area, and then the entire state on September 10.Atlanta was placed under its first-ever tropical storm warning.Governor Deal ordered mandatory evacuations for all areas east of Interstate 95 on September 7, before extending the order to the entirety of Chatham County and low-lying areas west of I-95 on the following day.In total, 540,000 people on the Georgia coast were ordered to leave.Contraflow lane reversal for Interstate 16 took effect on the morning of September 9 from Savannah to Dublin, Georgia.All Georgia state parks were open for free to evacuees, as was the 800-acre camping area at Atlanta Motor Speedway.Reversible HOT lanes on Interstate 75 in Georgia through south metro Atlanta were open 24 hours northbound with no tolls.\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on September 6, with South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster following suit the same day.Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency on September 8 in order to protect Virginia residents and to mobilize resources in support of neighboring states.Officials in New Orleans stated that there would not be much time for preparations if Irma failed to make the projected northward turn, but that South Texas or Florida would not be a good evacuation destination.On September 10, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam issued an executive order allowing medical professionals in other states to practice in Tennessee to aid Hurricane Irma evacuees.This order also allowed pharmacies to give out 14-day supplies of medicine, and gave women and children from outside the state the ability to participate in the Tennessee Department of Health programs.Bristol Motor Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway, and Charlotte Motor Speedway all opened their campgrounds to evacuees free of charge.\n\nIn professional sports, the Miami Dolphins–Tampa Bay Buccaneers game scheduled for September 10 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was postponed to November 19 due to the storm\'s threat.The Dolphins left early for their road game against the Los Angeles Chargers.The Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees moved their September 11–13 series from Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg to Citi Field in Queens.Minor League Baseball\'s Florida State League, Carolina League, and Southern League called off their championship finals and as a result, named their division series winners league co-champions.The Miami FC versus San Francisco Deltas match on September 10 was cancelled so the players and staff could prepare for the storm with their families.The Orlando Pride of the National Women\'s Soccer League rescheduled their September 9 match to September 7. Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer did not have any scheduled home games in September, but was unable to return to training facilities in Orlando due to Hurricane Irma.\n\nIn college football, the UCF Knights-Memphis Tigers game scheduled for September 9 was moved to September 30, replacing UCF\'s game against Maine and Memphis game against Georgia State.UCF also cancelled their game against Georgia Tech on September 16, as UCF\'s stadium hosted the National Guard.The USF Bulls-Connecticut Huskies football game was also cancelled.The Miami Hurricanes–Arkansas State Redwolves game scheduled for September 9 at Centennial Bank Stadium in Arkansas was canceled due to travel concerns for the University of Miami.The Florida Gators-Northern Colorado Bears match in Gainesville scheduled for September 9 was cancelled.The Florida State Seminoles contest against the Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks was canceled on September 8.The Seminoles\' rivalry game with the Hurricanes in Tallahassee, originally scheduled for September 16, was postponed tp October 7.The FIU Panthers game against the Alcorn State Braves was moved up a day and relocated to Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.The Georgia Southern Eagles game against the New Hampshire Wildcats on September 9 was also moved to Legion Field for that day.\n\nAs of September 5, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding was running dangerously low, due to its response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas the previous week, prompting the Trump administration to request an immediate $8 billion in additional funding as Irma approached Florida.Given the rate that current funds are being consumed and the catastrophic damage, the United States Senate almost doubled the requested amount to $15.3 billion, with the understanding that this would only be about 10% of what will be required for responding to Harvey.\n\nHurricane Irma\'s path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating, with landfalls in Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Martin, the Bahamas, Cuba, and the United States, all at major hurricane intensity.Furthermore, the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences.Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria.\n\nThe eyewall of the hurricane moved over Barbuda near its record peak intensity early on September 6; a weather station observed a wind gust of .The same station also recorded a minimum barometric pressure of .The exact state of the island remained unclear for hours after Irma\'s passage, as downed phone lines ceased all communication with nearby islands.Later that afternoon, Prime Minister Gaston Browne surveyed the territory by helicopter, revealing an effectively uninhabitable island.Irma damaged or destroyed 95% of the structures on Barbuda, including its hospital, schools, and both of its hotels; it completely flattened some residential blocks while submerging others.The destruction rendered the island\'s sole airport and much of its infrastructure inoperative—including water and telecommunication services—which further hampered relief efforts.Property damage on Barbuda ranged from $150 million to $300 million.A total of three storm-related deaths were reported on the island.\n\nIn addition to the catastrophic impact on Barbuda\'s human residents, concern turned to the storm\'s effects on the island\'s wildlife.The island\'s only endemic bird, the near-threatened Barbuda warbler, numbered less than 2,000 individuals prior to the hurricane.For some time it was unknown if the warbler survived the hurricane or its aftermath; however within a few months it was confirmed that not only did the species survive, but the most of the birds survived the storm.Barbuda\'s Codrington Lagoon, home to the largest colony of magnificent frigatebirds in the Caribbean, with an estimated 2,500 nesting pairs, was also inundated by the storm surge.\n\nRemaining just outside of Irma\'s strongest windfield, Antigua sustained less severe damage, in the form of leveled roofs and fences, downed power poles and lines, and uprooted trees.Some street flooding also took place in low-lying areas.Three people were treated for minor storm-related injuries.Forensic disaster analysts from the Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM), a Germany-based risk management agency, estimate that economic losses for Antigua and Barbuda will exceed $120 million.\n\nOn the morning of September 6, Irma\'s center crossed the island of Saint Martin while the storm was at peak intensity, sweeping away entire structures, submerging roads and cars, and triggering an island-wide blackout.Irma\'s extreme winds ripped trees out of the ground and sent vehicles and debris from damaged structures scattered across the territory.On the French side of Saint-Martin, entire marinas around Marigot were left in ruins, littered with the stranded remnants of boats that had smashed into each other.A hotel caught on fire, but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze.Another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor.Media images depicted devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds had shattered their windows.Irma killed four people on the French side of the island and injured 50 others, one of whom was in critical condition.As many as 95% of the buildings there were damaged to some degree; 60% of those were totally uninhabitable.Estimates from CEDIM indicate a minimum of $950 million worth of economic losses.Total losses exceeded €3.5 billion (US$4.17 billion).\n\nA similar situation unfolded in Sint Maarten, Saint Martin\'s Dutch half, as intense winds ripped through buildings and lifted vehicles aloft ""as if they were matches"".The hurricane wreaked havoc on Princess Juliana International Airport, with ""huge chunks of the building [strewn] across the runway and a jet bridge snapped in half.""It demolished or severely damaged about 70% of Sint Maarten\'s houses, forcing thousands of residents into public shelters.There were 4 deaths and 23 injuries, 11 of which were serious, in the Dutch territory.Irma is considered the worst natural disaster to hit Sint Maarten; the extent of its damage far exceeded that of any previous hurricane.Total damages were estimated at €2.5 billion (US$2.98 billion).\n\nIrma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the French island of Saint Barthélemy, southeast of Saint Martin.Describing the extent of the destruction, one local compared it to ""a bomb that burned all vegetation,"" while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively ""erased the island from the map"".Violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments, with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation.Streets in the capital of Gustavia were turned into rushing rivers, which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture.The island\'s fire station was inundated with up to of flood waters.With scores of homes and much of the infrastructure destroyed, the majority of the island\'s population was left stranded and without water, electricity or phone service.The associated economic losses could exceed $480 million according to CEDIM\'s analysts.\n\nPreliminary assessments from the French government indicate that Hurricane Irma caused a combined €1.2 billion (US$1.43 billion) in insured losses across the French territories of Saint-Martin and Saint Barts.This total covered private property such as homes, vehicles and businesses (including lost revenue); the extent of the damage to infrastructural and public facilities remains undetermined.Nonetheless, this made Irma one of the costliest natural disasters to hit the French Republic in 50 years.\n\nOn January 30, 2018, roughly five months after Irma, an analysis was published indicating that an anemometer on the island recorded an unofficial gust to before failing.\n\nThe British Overseas Territory of Anguilla saw the eyewall of the storm pass over it on September 6.Many homes and schools were destroyed, and the island\'s only hospital was badly damaged.The devastation was particularly severe in East End, where the winds uprooted scores of trees and power poles and demolished a number of houses.In The Valley, the island\'s capital, the hurricane blew out the windows of government buildings.Rough seas inflicted heavy damage upon several bays and harbors, and a seaside restaurant was completely eradicated.About 90% of roads were left impassable.The island\'s air traffic control tower was damaged, exacerbating the already poor communication with the island.One death was reported on the island.Estimates of losses on the island total at least $190 million.\n\nLarge swells ahead of Irma washed ashore debris and sea life in Castries, Saint Lucia, blocking some roads.Seaside roads were inundated with water.One surfer was killed amid rough surf in Barbados after hitting a reef and breaking his neck.Trees were also destroyed.The hurricane\'s effects, such as violent seas and rattling trees, were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in Guadeloupe.Several houses were damaged.Around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm, leaving several communes in the dark without running water.Overall damage was limited to external parts of houses and trees that were blown onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seas.\n\nSaint Kitts and Nevis endured similar conditions to other islands.Blustery rainstorms triggered scattered power outages and disabled the island\'s water system, but per the International Red Cross, the islands were spared the level of destruction seen elsewhere.Still, Prime Minister Timothy Harris stated that property and infrastructure had sustained ""significant damage.""The Dutch territories of Saba and Sint Eustatius were also struck by the hurricane\'s winds, resulting in infrastructural damage, water shortages and telecommunication outages.Several houses were left uninhabitable.On Saba, the hurricane also defoliated trees and injured a few people.CEDIM\'s analysts expect economic losses of $20–65 million for the two islands.\n\nDamage in the British Virgin Islands was extensive.Numerous buildings and roads were destroyed on the island of Tortola, which bore the brunt of the hurricane\'s core.Four people were confirmed dead.Along Cane Garden Bay, the storm surge submerged several seaside bars and a gas station.Satellite images revealed many of the island\'s residential zones had been left in ruins.The hurricane passed over Necker Island, also causing severe damage and destroying the mansion of Richard Branson.\n\nMost homes and businesses were destroyed on the island of Jost Van Dyke, the smallest of the B.V.I.\'s four main islands.The Governor, Gus Jaspert, who had only been sworn into office 13 days previously, declared a state of emergency - the first time this has ever happened in the Territory.After the storm, restoration of electricity took approximately 5 months.\n\nIrma\'s effects in the U.S. Virgin Islands were most profound on Saint Thomas, where at least of rain fell, and on Saint John.Saint Thomas island suffered widespread structural damage, including to its police station and airport.Patients from the fourth and third floors of Charlotte Amalie\'s hospital had to be relocated to lower floors due to flooding from roof leaks.Three deaths were attributed to Irma on the island.On nearby Saint Croix, there were communication issues and some damage to the infrastructure.Saint John lost access to ferry and cargo services, along with access to the local airport.Due to its normal reliance on electricity from Saint Thomas, the island was left without power.Total damage from the three islands was at least $1.1 billion.\n\nThe hurricane passed north of Puerto Rico, but still caused significant damage to the United States territory.Along the coast, a tide gauge observed waves up to mean higher high water.Much of the main island experienced sustained tropical storm force winds, with a peak sustained wind speed of at a weather station along San Juan Bay, while the same site observed a peak wind gust of .However, on the island of Culebra, a wind gust of was reported.Mainly due to strong winds, approximately 1.1 million out of 1.5 million of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority\'s customers lost electricity.Portions of Puerto Rico received heavy rainfall, with a peak total of in Bayamón, causing seven rivers to reach flood stage, widespread flash flooding, and at least six landslides.\n\nThe most severely affected areas included the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques, as well as the northeastern, northern, and mountainous portions of the main island.On Culebra, the island suffered an almost complete loss of electrical and water services.At least 30 homes on the island were destroyed, while about 30 other experienced substantial damage.High winds also toppled a number of trees.The only telecommunications tower on Culebra sustained damage, cutting off outside communications for several hours.In rural Loíza, 79 homes were destroyed.Throughout Puerto Rico, 781 out of 1,600 telecommunications towers went out of commission, primarily due to power outages.At least 362,000 customers lost water services.Debris, mostly fallen trees, blocked at least 72 roads.Approximately 25% to 30% of banana, coffee, papaya, and plantain crops were damaged by strong winds, with losses to farmers estimated at $30.6 million.Approximately 1,530 homes experienced at least moderate damage, with 1,448 homes moderately damaged, 32 extensively damaged, and 50 completely destroyed.\n\nHurricane Irma was attributed to around $1 billion in damage, and the NHC attributed three fatalities to Irma in Puerto Rico, though four deaths were related to the storm.Two people died due to rainstorms ahead of the hurricane: one man died in Orocovis after falling off his ladder while repairing his roof; another man on the coast in Capitanejo died after being struck by lightning.Three nearby fishermen were burned by the same lightning strike, but survived.Two other people died during the hurricane: a woman died while being evacuated from her house in a wheelchair and fell, hitting her head; another person died in a car accident in Canóvanas.Governor Ricardo Rosselló declared the islands of Culebra and Vieques to be disaster areas.\n\nAlthough spared a direct hit, both the Dominican Republic and Haiti were affected by high winds and heavy rains.A bridge over the Dajabón River connecting the two countries was broken.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, the fishing community of Nagua sustained damage from waves that destroyed homes.55,000 soldiers were deployed to affected areas to help with the clean-up efforts.By the evening of September 7, the government had counted 2,721 damaged homes.\n\nIn Haiti, flooding one meter deep sat in residential neighborhoods in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives.Mudslides, destroyed homes, flooded crops, and infrastructure damage were reported in the northern part of the country.The total expanse of the flooding stretched from Môle-Saint-Nicolas in the west to the eastern border with the Dominican Republic.\n\nOn the evening of September 7, at 7:30 pm AST (23:30 UTC), Hurricane Irma reached the Turks and Caicos Islands.While the eye passed just south of the main islands, crossing over South Caicos and the Ambergris Cays, the most powerful winds on the northern side of the eye swept all of the islands for more than two hours.Communications infrastructure was destroyed.\n\nOn September 8, Minister of Infrastructure Goldray Ewing confirmed that damage to Providenciales was extensive, with the northwestern neighborhood of Blue Hill being ""gone"".The hospital in the capital, Cockburn Town, was heavily damaged.On South Caicos, 75% of roofs were lost.Total damage was estimated at over $500 million.\n\nIn the Bahamas, the eye of the storm passed over Duncan Town, the major settlement of the Ragged Islands chain, on September 8.It also passed ""almost directly over"" Inagua and South Acklins, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.\n\nDamages were largely confined to the southern islands starting the morning of September 8.On Mayaguana and Great Inagua, downed power lines knocked out communications.On Great Inagua, 70% of homes sustained roof damage, and the island\'s school lost its roof entirely.The Morton Salt Company\'s signature production facility, one of the major employers in the country, experienced millions of dollars in damages.The Acklins settlement of Salina Point was cut off from the rest of the island by flooding, while Crooked Island had widespread roof damage.In the northern Bahamas, the worst property damage came on September 10 as the outer bands of the system produced tornadic activity on Grand Bahama and Bimini.Damage and losses across The Bahamas amounted to $135 million.\n\nWhile Irma was making landfall in Florida, the ocean was drawn away from some western shorelines of the Bahamas due to strong easterly winds.\n\nEarly on September 9, Irma made landfall on the Camagüey Archipelago off the northern coast of Cuba, with sustained winds of .The strongest official sustained wind speed was , while the highest wind gust reached ; both were observed near Camila in Ciego de Ávila Province.The weather station at Esmeralda, Camagüey, was damaged, with the wind gauge destroyed.The north coast of Cuba experienced significant coastal flooding due to storm surge and abnormally high tides generated by the storm.Wave heights at Cayo Romano exceeded .Storm surge penetrated as far as inland in some areas of Villa Clara Province.Multiple locations on the island observed at least of rainfall, with a peak total of of precipitation at Topes de Collantes.\n\nA total of 158,554 homes experienced some degree of damage, of which 14,657 were destroyed; approximately 1.9 million people experienced the direct effects of Irma.The storm partially deroofed 103,691 homes, while 23,560 were completely deroofed.Irma damaged or destroyed 980 health facilities and 2,264 schools.Approximately 3.1 million people experienced disruptions to the water supply, while 246,707 people lost telephone service.About of roads were damaged.Crops also suffered extensively, with nearly affected by the storm.Throughout the country, the hurricane inflicted $13.185 billion in damage and killed 10 people, making Irma the costliest tropical cyclone in Cuban history.\n\nThe tourist areas of Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and Cayo Santa María and the nearby town of Caibarién received the brunt of the storm, with waves rolling through town and the characteristic one-story homes completely flooded.The storm most severely Ciego de Ávila and Villa Clara provinces.Flooding worsened as the hurricane moved west, pushing the storm surge along to the regions around Havana.By the afternoon, limited flooding was occurring in Havana, including around the Malecón.Portions of province coastal flooding surpassing that which was experienced during the Storm of the Century in 1993 and Hurricane Wilma in 2005.In the city of Santa Clara, 39 buildings collapsed.Rainfall resulted in several rivers reaching major flood stage.The town of Cabaiguán in Sancti Spíritus Province in particular suffered extensive inland flooding after the Zaza River swelled.\n\nHurricane Irma directly affected a major colony of American flamingos on Cuba\'s northern Cayo Coco.Early reports from Diario de Cuba indicated that several hundred flamingos had been killed by the storm, though other estimates ranged as high as several thousand birds.\n\nHurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida.Except for the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned.Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba, but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys.The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States.After surveying the aftermath of Irma, Florida governor Rick Scott said ""I thought we would see more damage""[on the mainland] but said ""he witnessed devastation in the Keys"".President Donald Trump commented on Twitter that the devastation in some places was ""far greater than anyone thought"".\n\nDamage in the United States was estimated at a minimum of $50 billion.At the time, Irma was the fourth costliest tropical cyclone in the United States, behind hurricanes Sandy in 2012, Harvey earlier that year, and Katrina in 2005.However, later in September 2017, Hurricane Maria became the third costliest United States tropical cyclone, causing Irma to fall to the fifth costliest.At least 92 people, 10 directly and 82 indirectly, died throughout the United States in relation to Irma: 84 in Florida, 3 in Georgia, 3 in South Carolina, and 2 in North Carolina.\n\nIrma struck the state less than two weeks after Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten had caused the worst flooding seen in western Florida in 20 years, which further worsened the impacts in the region.The storm\'s large wind field resulted in strong winds across much of Florida, except for the western Panhandle.The highest reported sustained wind speed was on Marco Island, while the strongest observed wind gust was , recorded near Naples, though wind gusts of likely occurred in the Middle Florida Keys.More than 7.7 million homes and businesses in Florida were left without electricity at some point – approximately 73% of state.Generally heavy amounts of rainfall were recorded to the east of the Irma\'s path, including a peak total of in Fort Pierce.Heavy precipitation – and storm surge, in some instances – overflowed at least 32 rivers and creeks, causing significant flooding, particularly along the St. Johns River and its tributaries.Many homes and businesses suffered damage or destruction, with more than 65,000 structures damaged to some degree in West Central and Southwest Florida alone.Agriculture experienced about $2.5 billion in damage.It was estimated that the cyclone caused at least $50 billion in damage, making Irma the costliest hurricane in Florida history, surpassing Hurricane Andrew, until it was itself surpassed by Hurricane Ian, 5 years later.\n\nThroughout Florida, at least 84 people died in storm-related incidents.About half of the deaths occurred from drowning, trauma, and carbon monoxide poisoning.Broward County had 21 fatalities, the most of any county in Florida.Among those deaths were 12 people at The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, a Hollywood nursing home.The patients died from sweltering heat worsened by the lack of air conditioning.The hurricane also left at least 14 deaths in Monroe County; 6 deaths in Orange County; 5 deaths each in Duval, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties; 4 deaths in both Highlands and Hillsborough counties; 3 deaths in both Marion and Polk counties; 2 deaths each in Collier, Hardee, Leon, Pinellas, St. Lucie, and Taylor counties; and 1 death in Hendry, Lake, Lee, Liberty, Manatee, Nassau, Okeechobee, Pasco, Seminole, St. Johns, and Volusia counties.\n\nWith Irma making landfall in Monroe County as a Category 4 hurricane, the Florida Keys were hardest hit area in the state.Strong winds and storm surge flooding caused major damage to buildings, trailer parks, boats, roads, the electricity supply, mobile phone coverage, internet access, sanitation, the water supply and the fuel supply throughout the island chain.An estimated storm surge occurred at Cudjoe Key, where Irma made landfall.Throughout the island, 625 homes sustained minor damage, 52 sustained major damage, and 81 were demolished.On Big Pine Key, one of the most devastated islands, 633 homes received minor impact, 299 homes received major impact, and 473 homes were completely destroyed.Overall in Monroe County, 27,649 homes experienced some degree of damage, including 1,179 homes being destroyed, 2,977 homes receiving major damage, and 5,361 suffering minor damage.\n\nAfter devastating the Keys, the storm then struck Collier County as a Category 3 hurricane.Several communities in the county suffered extensive damage, especially along the coast.Throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, 65 homes, including 44 mobile homes, were demolished, while 1,008 homes received major damage.Property damages in unincorporated areas alone reach about $320 million.Lee County was lashed by strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused prolonged flooding in some areas.More than 24,000 homes suffered some degree of damage, with almost 3,000 homes receiving major damage and 89 homes being destroyed.Damage in the county totaled about $857 million.\n\nImpact in much of the Miami metropolitan area was generally limited to extensive tree and fence damage, as well as widespread power outages.However, in Miami-Dade County, about 1,000 homes received major damage and about 50% of crops were lost.Storm surge caused coastal flooding from Homestead to Downtown Miami, as well as in portions of Miami Beach.Parts of the Florida Heartland were devastated by high winds and flooding, particularly Hendry and Highlands counties.In the former, which has most citrus trees of any county in Florida, about 60% of orange crops were lost.Throughout Hendry County, a total of 451 homes had minor damage, 131 homes suffered major damage, and 42 others were destroyed.In Highlands County, 13,138 businesses and homes were damaged to some degree, with 144 being destroyed, 963 sustaining major damage, and 2,408 receiving minor damage.In Orange County, wind gusts reached 79 mph at Orlando International Airport.A wind gust of 91 mph was also recorded in Orlando at the top of the Disney Contemporary Resort.Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central Florida left some wind damage and flooding, necessitating evacuations and rescues, including more than 200 people in Orlo Vista after hundreds of homes were flooded.A total of 2,999 business or homes were damaged in Lake County, 7,430 in Seminole County, and 3,457 in Volusia County.Additionally, eight tornadoes touched down in Brevard County, all of which caused damage.\n\nAlong much of the Gulf Coast of Florida, to the north of where Irma made landfall, negative storm surges were observed, with water retracting rather than pushing inland, causing little coastal flooding.However, on the opposite coast, extensive erosion and storm surge flooding occurred in the First Coast, especially in Duval and St. Johns counties.In Duval County, the St. Johns River crested at heights that exceeded records set during Hurricane Dora in 1964.Portions of Jacksonville experienced flooding, particularly the downtown area and the Riverside and San Marco neighborhoods, with about 350 people rescued in those sections of the city.Water reached about high in some homes.The city of Jacksonville suffered about $85 million in damage.\n\nIn St. Johns County, storm surge left extensive damage to oceanfront properties in Ponte Vedra Beach and Vilano Beach, with several becoming uninhabitable.Additionally, some riverfront businesses in St. Augustine\'s historic district were flooded due to storm surge from the Matanzas River.In nearby Clay County, rainfall and storm surge combined to cause extensive flooding along portions of the Black Creek and the St. Johns River, with record high crests at several locations along the former.About 350 people and 75 animals were rescued from floodwaters throughout the county.A total of 275 homes were destroyed, 175 were inflicted major damage, and 124 received minor damage.\n\nThree deaths were reported in Georgia due to falling trees and debris, along with widespread wind damage and power outages throughout the state primarily due to fallen trees.On Tybee Island, as well as St. Simons Island the storm surge caused extensive flooding.The tropical storm also did $54 million in damage in the state.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the third highest storm surge on record was recorded, reaching a height of approximately .By of September 12, almost 100,000 had lost power in Upstate South Carolina.Five people died in storm-related incidents across South Carolina, all from indirect incidents.The tropical storm caused damages totaling $500,000 in the state.\n\nLight damage occurred in other areas, including Tennessee.About 75,000 customers in North Carolina lost power due to Irma.It also caused $600,000 in damages in Alabama.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Irma\'s path through the West Indies and Caribbean, the devastation to roads, harbors and airports significantly impeded the transportation and distribution of relief supplies.Foreign countries moved to provide much of the initial aid.The British, Dutch, French, and United States governments sent warships and planes with supplies and manpower to the region.International leaders, including Dutch King Willem-Alexander and French President Emmanuel Macron, quickly moved to visit affected territories.\n\nSome of the affected countries and territories also offered assistance to each other.Cuba, which sustained extensive damage from the storm, sent 750 health workers to Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, Dominica, and Haiti.Government officials and members of the public in Puerto Rico delivered assistance and evacuated people stranded on other islands.The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services granted special 30-day humanitarian visas for British Virgin Islanders to stay in Puerto Rico.Hundreds of people stranded on Saint Martin were flown to the Dominican Republic on humanitarian grounds.\n\nIn response to Hurricane Jose\'s approach, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a mandatory evacuation on September 9 for any remaining residents on Barbuda.A Miami cargo plane landed on Antigua later that day, carrying over 60 tons (120,000 lbs) of relief supplies for the displaced storm victims—including bottled water, canned food and power generators.\n\nRFA Mounts Bay stationed itself near Anguilla and provided support and relief work to the island with its helicopters and 40 marines and army engineers.The ship delivered 6 tonnes of emergency aid to Anguilla and army engineers repaired a fuel leak at Anguilla\'s main petrol dump, restored power to the island\'s hospital and provided shelters for those left homeless by the hurricane.The ship arrived in the British Virgin Islands on September 8, 2017, to provide emergency relief to the islands, including providing shelters, food and water.HMS Ocean was diverted from the Mediterranean to provide relief from Gibraltar to the affected British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos on September 7, and aid was also supplied by the Department for International Development from their disaster response centre at Kemble Airfield.As part of a £32 million operation named Operation Ruman, nearly 500 UK military personnel with emergency relief were dispatched from RAF Brize Norton.This included the first deployment of No. 38 Expeditionary Air Wing with 3 RAF aircraft; 2 Airbus A400M Atlas and 1 C130J hercules to support relief efforts.\n\nThe British government also drafted 2 members of the UK police calibre into the region on September 10, and 53 police officers were drafted from RAF Brize Norton to the affected British Overseas Territories on September 15 to help maintain order.UK politicians, including the chairs of the foreign affairs and development select committees, criticized both the government\'s preparations for the storm and its response as inadequate.\n\nBy September 12, the Department for International Development had delivered more than 40 tonnes of aid into the region, including into Turks and Caicos, and 1,000 UK military troops were deployed in the region as part of relief efforts.The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, pledged an additional £25 million worth of funding as part of relief efforts in the region on September 13, 2017, and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Boris Johnson, said that a further 250 UK military personnel would be deployed into the area within the next few days.Anguilla\'s Chief Minister, Victor Banks, praised the British government\'s response to the storm and said that Boris Johnson\'s visit to the island ""sends a very positive signal to Anguillans that the British are serious about their response to this very severe hurricane"", but went on to say that the current financial commitment from the UK was not substantial enough.\n\nBy September 15, the United Kingdom had over 70 military personnel and 4 police officers in Anguilla and had delivered 15 tonnes of aid to the island.In the British Virgin Islands, Royal Marines had cleared the airfield so that it was operational for the delivery of aid into the islands, with more than 200 British military personnel and 54 UK police officers on the ground and 8 tonnes of aid delivered to the islands.120 British military personnel were on the ground in Turks and Caicos, and over 150 shelter kits and 720 liters of water were delivered to the islands on September 15.\n\nAmendments to international aid rules by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (or OECD) allowed for the UK government to provide access to £13 billion worth of aid to the affected British Overseas Territories, through the UK\'s Official Development Assistance (ODA) by November 2017.\n\nBy the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage.The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by Irma\'s eye, remained largely inaccessible for days.Assessments showed that 15% of the national telecommunications network had been affected, with at least one tower destroyed.Bahamasair resumed a limited domestic schedule on September 10, with international flights still cancelled due to existing and anticipated destruction at other destinations.\n\nThe worst devastation occurred on Ragged Island, over which Irma\'s eye had directly passed.After days of the National Emergency Management Agency not being able to physically reach the island, officials were finally able to inspect it; they promptly declared it uninhabitable.Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said that it was the worst disaster area he or his officials had ever seen, and that all remaining residents would need to leave, potentially permanently.Business leaders and other officials called for a new long-term development model to shift the population away from such sparsely-settled islands.\n\nOn Grand Bahama and Bimini, where tornadoes associated with Irma touched down on September 10, more than 100 people were left displaced.Infrastructure damage included docks, parks, and the power system.\n\nAside from tangible asset losses, Irma brought significant economic damages.International freight shipping was projected to be offline for a week, and costs for rebuilding supplies were inflated due to demand in the U.S.\n\nSwollen rivers contributed to worsening flooding in the days after the storm system left, resulting in additional evacuations.Officials resorted to using inflatable rafts to access affected areas.The national electrical infrastructure was said to be extensively damaged.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, flooding worsened following Irma\'s departure, leading the number of displaced persons to increase to more than 24,000 by September 8.President Danilo Medina ordered further evacuations due to at-risk dams, while the government banned swimming in rivers and ordered boats kept in port.More than 422,000 people were left without water due to 28 aqueducts being damaged.\n\nIn Haiti, officials stated that losses were greater than they could have been since people largely did not heed early preparation and evacuation warnings.At least 5,000 homes were flooded.One man died trying to cross a flooded river; another went missing and 17 were injured.The trash- and waste-contaminated floodwaters in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives led to fears of cholera outbreaks.Flooding continued to worsen days after the storm, as runoff from the mountains swelled rivers in low-lying farming communities.United Nations peacekeepers from Brazil were able to gain access to the flooded northwest region to provide urgent aid, but non-governmental organizations and Haitian economists warned that the estimated 30,000 victims would need longer-term assistance as well.Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant appointed a government commission to address Irma\'s effects, with Action Against Hunger in charge of humanitarian coordination.\n\nIn the USVI, residents and tourists alike were described as being in a state of traumatic shock.By September 7, the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship had arrived in the USVI to provide supplies, damage assessment, and evacuation assistance.Four additional warships, some of which had already been on their way to Texas to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief, were redirected to the region.At a September 10 news conference, Governor Kenneth Mapp described Irma as a ""horrific disaster"" for which ""[t]here will be no restorations or solutions in days or weeks.""The Federal Emergency Management Agency airlifted in goods for residents, who were subjected to a curfew.Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line agreed to transport tourists to Florida, contingent upon port availability following the state\'s own experience with Irma.\n\nOn Saint John, described as ""perhaps the site of Irma\'s worst devastation on American soil,"" it took six days for an active-theater disaster zone to be established, leading to criticism of the U.S. government response.The National Guard was delayed in reaching Saint John due to the number of overturned boats left in the harbor.The National Guard was brought in to maintain order, while the Coast Guard brought evacuees to cruise ships bound for San Juan and Miami.There was still no electricity on St. John in the middle of October 2017.\n\nBy September 9, more than one million Puerto Ricans were still without power, tens of thousands were without water, and several thousand were still in shelters.Hospitals were operating on generator power.The government was struggling to establish contact with the islands of Culebra and Vieques.By September 10, the main island had recovered enough to serve as a refuge for people stranded on other islands, including 1,200 tourists from Saint Martin and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Airlifts had brought more than 50 patients to Puerto Rico.\n\nFive months after Irma, two-thirds of the hospital beds on Saint Thomas were still unavailable, due to extensive physical damage and staffing shortages.\n\nDamage to Sint Maarten\'s harbour and to Princess Juliana International Airport left the Dutch part of Saint Martin unreachable, although the smaller Grand Case-Espérance Airport on the French side could be reopened by September 7 for supply aid by helicopter and airplane.The French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops on board a CASA/IPTN CN-235 aircraft.\n\nThe following day, the Dutch military was able to airlift dialysis patients off the island while also dropping leaflets to warn islanders about the rapidly approaching Hurricane Jose.Although the airport was closed, 435 students and faculty of the American University of the Caribbean were evacuated by the U.S. military.On September 10, Dutch King Willem-Alexander departed for the region, with intentions to visit Sint Maarten and other affected Dutch territories and commonwealth members.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron followed this announcement by stating his intentions to visit the French part of the island on September 12 in order to bring aid supplies.In response to criticism of the French handling of the disaster, 1,000 troops, police, and other emergency workers were sent to Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.\n\nOn both sides of Saint Martin, desperate conditions combined with food and water shortages in Irma\'s aftermath led to reports of violence, scavenging, and theft.In response, the French government increased its troop deployment to 2,200 and the Dutch government sent more than 600 military and police personnel.\n\nThe day after the hurricane hit Saint Barthelemy the French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops into the reopened Grand Case-Espérance Airport.On September 7 and 9, equipment and personnel were flown from France to Guadeloupe and Martinique.\n\nSporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm.\n\nOn September 11, Florida Governor Rick Scott conducted an aerial tour to survey the damage to the Keys.The Overseas Highway remained closed while authorities assessed the integrity of the 42 bridges along the route.Residents returning to the Keys were faced with a police roadblock, to the south of Florida City.USS Iwo Jima, USS New York and aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were sent to the Keys area to aid with the recovery.\n\nOn September 12, some residents were allowed to return into the Keys as far as Islamorada.Although road damage blocked entry any farther than Islamorada, bridges had been inspected and found safe to Sugarloaf Key.By late on September 12, the Overseas Highway had been repaired and the bridges inspected as safe for first responders to travel to Key West.On September 16, residents were free to return to Marathon.Residents were allowed to return to Key West the following day, although the Keys remained closed to tourists and a checkpoint remained in place in Florida City.\n\nDue mainly to the widespread loss of power, cell phone service was also reduced after battery backup power for cell phone towers ran out and backup generators ran out of fuel.In an impact report by the FCC, as of 11 AM EDT on September 12, 89 of 108 (82%) cell phone towers were non-functioning in Monroe County (Florida Keys), 154 of 212 (73%) were non-functioning in Collier County (Naples), 36 of 46 (78%) were non-functioning in Hendry County, and an additional six counties had 41-60% of cell phone towers not functioning, including Lee County (Fort Myers) and Miami-Dade County.\n\nNOAA released map-format aerial reconnaissance image data of damage from the storm.The imagery featured several areas of Florida: including the Florida Keys, the southwest coast of Florida from Marco Island to Punta Gorda, much of the northeast coast of Florida, and portions of the Jacksonville area.Portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts were also photographed.Additionally, the Sun-Sentinel published before and after photos of several landmarks in the Florida Keys.\n\nIn the days after the hurricane, due to the heavy rainfall, numerous rivers had flooded, including residential areas.Public health risks, such as diarrheal infections and mosquito-borne illnesses, remain from the flooding that resulted in the aftermath of the hurricane.A large concern from flooding is contamination because people become exposed to dirty floodwaters and the potential for contaminated water to enter the local water supply is significant.One example of an illness that can enter the water supply is leptospirosis, which is rat urine carries into the floodwaters.Untreated exposure to leptospirosis can cause kidney damage, meningitis, and liver failure.Noroviruses and other infections are also a risk.\n\nFollowing Irma\'s passage, a hand-carved wooden canoe was discovered on the banks of the Indian River and could be several hundred years old.The state has removed the canoe for examination and safe keeping.\n\nDue to Irma\'s and Hurricane Harvey\'s impact in Florida and Texas, U.S. employment declined in September 2017 for the first time since September 2010.The leisure and hospitality industries were especially hard hit, losing 111,000 jobs in September.\n\nIrma set multiple records for intensity, especially at easterly longitudes, time spent at such an intensity, and its intensity at landfall.When Irma reached Category 5 intensity with winds of at 11:45 UTC on September 5 at 57.7°W, it became the easternmost Atlantic hurricane of this strength on record, surpassing Hurricane David of 1979, later beaten by Hurricane Lorenzo 2 years later.By 00:15 UTC on September 6, Irma reached peak intensity with () winds and a minimum pressure of .This ties it with Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and Hurricane Rita of 2005 as the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed.Only five other Atlantic hurricanes have been recorded with wind speeds higher than Irma: Hurricane Allen of 1980, which had maximum sustained winds of , and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Gilbert of 1988, Hurricane Wilma of 2005, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, all of which had peak winds of .At the time, Irma was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; later surpassed by Hurricane Dorian, and was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007.In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category 5 strength winds, and the third-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, with a value of 64.9 units.Only the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane and Hurricane Ivan in 2004 achieved higher values.\n\nOn September 6, Irma made landfall on the islands of Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Virgin Gorda at peak strength.This ties Irma with cyclones Monica of 2006 and Winston of 2016, and typhoons Zeb of 1998 and Megi of 2010 as the seventh-strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall globally – in terms of sustained winds – trailing only Typhoon Goni of 2020 which bore winds of at landfall, Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 and Typhoon Meranti of 2016, which bore winds of at landfall, and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Typhoon Joan of 1959, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, which bore winds of at landfall.Irma is second to the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin, and is the first hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic at Category 5 status since Felix in 2007.Irma is the first recorded Category 5 hurricane to affect the northern Leeward Islands, and was one of the worst storms to hit the region on record, along with Hurricane Donna in 1960 and Hurricane Luis in 1995.In addition, Irma is only the second hurricane on record to make landfall in Cuba at Category 5 intensity, with the other being a hurricane in 1924.Furthermore, when Irma made landfall on Barbuda, Saint Martin, Virgin Gorda, and Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane, it became one of only two recorded Atlantic storms to make landfall in multiple nations at this strength; the other was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which struck both Eleuthera and the United States as a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nIrma made landfall in the Florida Keys with winds of and a pressure of , making it the strongest hurricane to strike Florida in terms of wind speed since Charley in 2004, and the most intense to strike the state in terms of barometric pressure since Andrew in 1992.In the span of two weeks, two Category 4 hurricanes—Harvey and Irma—struck the continental United States, the first time on record two Atlantic tropical cyclones of such strength made landfall on the country in the same hurricane season.This also marked only the third occurrence of two consecutive Atlantic storms making landfall in the United States as major hurricanes.The other two instances were the Great Charleston and Cheniere Caminada hurricanes in 1893, and hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne in 2004.\n\nBecause of the extensive damage and loss of life the hurricane caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Irma from its rotating naming lists in April 2018, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane.It was replaced with Idalia for the 2023 season.\n\nWeather of 2017 Tropical cyclones in 2017 List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes Operation RUMAN – UK military-civil disaster relief response to Hurricane Irma.List of Cuba hurricanes List

one in Barbados; three in Barbuda; four in the British Virgin Islands; 10 in Cuba; 11 in the French West Indies; one in Haiti; three in Puerto Rico; four on the Dutch side of Sint Maarten; 92 in the contiguous United States, and four in the U.S. Virgin Islands.Hurricane Irma was the top Google searched term in the U.S. and globally in 2017.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa on August 26.The tropical wave moved off the coast of the continent late on August 27.Throughout the next two days, showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low-pressure area, as the system passed just south of and then through the Cape Verde Islands on August 29.Around 00:00 UTC on the following day, the system developed into a tropical depression just west of the Cape Verde Islands.Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Irma, based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates.With warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, strengthening was anticipated, with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier air.\n\nThe nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow, as an anticyclone became established over the system, with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images.Early on August 31, shortly after the development of a central dense overcast (CDO) and an eye feature, Irma underwent rapid intensification, becoming a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 UTC and then a Category 3 hurricane, becoming a major hurricane – around 00:00 UTC on September 1.Within a 48-hour period, the hurricane\'s intensity had increased by .On September 2, a ship passed to the west of the center of Irma, recording maximum winds of , which indicated that the eye of Irma remained compact.A strong high pressure system to the north of Irma caused the storm to move west-southwestward between September 2 and September 4.The first aircraft reconnaissance mission departed from Barbados on the afternoon of September 3, discovering an eye in diameter and surface winds of .\n\nOn September 4, after moving into more favorable conditions, Irma strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane.As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by 12:00 UTC on the following day, with winds of .The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at near 18:00 UTC on September 5. Irma acquired annular characteristics around this time, with the storm exhibiting a large, symmetric CDO and an impressive satellite appearance.Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern Leeward Islands.Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of Barbuda at peak intensity, with the storm\'s central minimum pressure having bottomed out at – this was the lowest in the Atlantic since Dean in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of .Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15 UTC on Sint Maarten, and at 16:30 UTC on Virgin Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands, though the storm\'s central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall.\n\nAs the hurricane moved away from the Virgin Islands late on September 6, observations from reconnaissance flights, as well as Doppler radar in San Juan, Puerto Rico, indicated an elliptical eye and double eyewalls.Late on September 6, the cyclone passed about north of Puerto Rico.Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of Hispaniola throughout the day on September 7.After beginning an eyewall replacement cycle, Irma weakened to a Category 4 hurricane as it passed south of the Turks and Caicos Islands early on September 8.This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category 5 intensity, the second-longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above – behind only the 1932 Cuba hurricane.At 05:00 UTC on September 8, Irma made landfall on the island of Little Inagua in the Bahamas with sustained winds of .The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a subtropical ridge to its north.Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category 5 intensity at 18:00 UTC that day east of Cuba as deep convection became more pronounced and organized.The hurricane then made landfall in Cayo Romano, Cuba, at 03:00 UTC on September 9, with winds of .This made Irma only the second Category 5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the 1924 Cuba hurricane.As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category 2 storm later on September 9.\n\nAfter slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards Florida around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental United States.Moving over the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, Irma quickly restrengthened to a Category 4 hurricane at 06:00 UTC on September 10, as deep convection improved and the eye became better defined.In addition, Irma\'s wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of and gale-force winds spanning in diameter.The cyclone made landfall in Cudjoe Key, Florida, at 13:00 UTC on September 10, at Category 4 intensity, with winds of .Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category 3 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30 UTC, in Marco Island, Florida, with sustained winds of .Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category 3 intensity hours after landfall.Passing east of Tampa as a weakening Category 1 hurricane around 06:00 UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation – though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds.The system finally weakened to a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC that day as it entered southern Georgia, while acquiring some extratropical characteristics.At 06:00 UTC on September 12, Irma degenerated to a remnant low just as it entered Alabama, as most of the deep convection had diminished.The remnants persisted for another day or so before dissipating over Missouri on September 13.\n\nGiven that Irma\'s forecast track was along much of the Caribbean island chain, hurricane warnings were issued for the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and parts of Hispaniola on September 5.\n\nIn Antigua and Barbuda, residents safeguarded their homes and cleaned up their properties in anticipation of strong winds.Emergency crews were put on standby at public shelters and hospitals by September 5 to assist with any evacuations.Expecting a direct hit, more than half of the residents on Barbuda took shelter, and relief supplies were preemptively mobilized.The National Emergency Management Organization on Saint Lucia urged small craft operators and swimmers to be mindful of forecasts for high surf.Small Craft Warnings and High Surf Advisories were hoisted for Dominica, where residents were urged to remain vigilant of the potential for high waves, landslides, and flooding.\n\nIn Guadeloupe, low-lying and cliff-edge homes were evacuated at the threat of flooding and erosion.Schools and public businesses closed on September 5 and 6.Hospitals stocked up on three days\' worth of supplies and checked the functionality of their generators.Of the island\'s 32 communes, 22 activated their emergency plans; 1,500 people were urged to take shelter.The island sustained relatively minor damage and became the base for relief efforts on Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.Though the core of the hurricane was expected to remain north of the island, a yellow alert was issued for Martinique due to the likelihood of rough seas.The island dispatched relief supplies and military reinforcements to its neighboring islands of Guadeloupe, Saint Martin.and Saint Barthélemy, which faced a greater risk of a direct impact.\n\nOn September 4, Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency.By September 6, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency had deployed response teams in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.Supplies, including food rations, medical supplies, and blankets, were pre-staged in strategic locations on the islands for distribution.\n\nOn September 5, the Dominican Republic activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage; the United States and Haiti followed suit two days later.According to officials, 11,200 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas prior to the storm\'s arrival.Approximately 7,400 tourists were moved to Santo Domingo, away from beach resorts.In Haiti, government officials and aid organizations struggled with early preparation and evacuation efforts.While some officials blamed reluctance and indifference on the part of the population, others ""admitted they were not prepared for the onslaught and no mandatory evacuation orders were in place ahead of Irma\'s approach.""Local officials contended that they had not received promised funds, supplies, or equipment from the national government.The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti prepared its 1,000 peacekeepers and engineers to assist.\n\nIn the Turks and Caicos, evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas starting September 5. Schools were closed, government buildings were boarded up, and shelters were opened.Officials spread warnings to residents in English, Creole, and Spanish via social media, radio, SMS text, and WhatsApp.In The Bahamas, the government began preparations the week prior to the hurricane\'s arrival, including securing national sports facilities to use as shelters.By September 7, the government had evacuated 1,609 people by air from the southern islands, including 365 from Bimini.Controlled cutting of the power supply to southern and central Bahamian islands was conducted in advance of the storm.Shelters were made available, though usage was low due to most evacuees staying with family on other islands.Of the 2,679 foreign tourists still in The Bahamas on September 7, about 1,200 were being housed at Atlantis Paradise Island, one of the most hurricane-ready structures in the country.\n\nIn Cuba, meteorologists did not initially predict a direct hit.Fuel conservation was enacted in Camagüey Province to ensure that enough would be available during post-storm power outages.The Civil Defense evacuated nearly one million people from low-lying areas, including thousands of Canadian and European tourists in the Jardines del Rey.Dolphins at a Cayo Guillermo resort were evacuated by helicopter.\n\nThe NHC issued several watches and warnings for the Southeastern United States.The first watches and warnings were issued at 15:00 UTC on September 7, which was a hurricane watch from the Jupiter Inlet to Bonita Beach, including the Florida Keys and Lake Okeechobee.The watches and warnings were extended into Georgia and South Carolina on September 9.At 21:00 UTC on that day, the advisories reached their maximum extent, with a hurricane warning covering the entire east coast of the state, the west coast from Indian Pass southward, and the Florida Keys; a hurricane watch was in place from the Florida–Georgia state line to Edisto Beach, South Carolina; and there were two tropical storm warnings, one in Florida from Indian Pass to the Okaloosa–Walton county line and the other from the Florida–Georgia state line to the South Santee River in South Carolina.Watches and warnings were gradually discontinued as Irma moved inland and weakened, with all of them canceled by early on September 12.\n\nOn September 4, Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency.Governor Scott placed 100 members of the Florida National Guard on duty to assist in preparations.All 7,000 troops were ordered to be on duty by September 8.Officials advised residents to stock their hurricane kits.The state coordinated with electrical companies in order for power outages to be restored as quickly as possible, extending resources such as equipment, fuel, and lodging for the approximately 24,000 restoration personnel who had been activated.Governor Scott suspended tolls on all toll roads in Florida, including the turnpike.All state offices in Florida were closed from September 8 to September 11, while public schools, state colleges, and state universities in all 67 counties were closed during the same period.The Florida Department of Education coordinated with school districts as the need for transportation by school buses and opening shelters arose.By September 9, more than 150 state parks were closed.Throughout the state, almost 700 emergency shelters were opened.The shelters collectively housed about 191,764 people, with more than 40% of them staying in a shelter in South Florida.Additionally, more than 60 special needs shelters were opened, which housed more than 5,000 people by September 9.\n\nMany airports across the state, particularly in Central and South Florida, were closed.Nearly 9,000 flights intending to arrive in or depart from Florida were canceled.Along Florida\'s coasts, most seaports were closed or opened with restricted access.For the fifth time in its 45-year history, the Walt Disney World Resort was completely closed due to the storm.Its theme parks, water parks, and Disney Springs were all closed by 9:00 p.m. on September 9 and remained closed until September 12.Other Orlando-area theme parks, including Universal Orlando Resort and SeaWorld Orlando, were also closed.The Kennedy Space Center was closed from September 8 to September 15.\n\nAn estimated 6.5 million Floridians were ordered to evacuate, mostly those living on barrier islands or in coastal areas; in mobile or sub-standard homes; and in low-lying or flood prone areas.Mandatory evacuations were ordered for portions of Brevard, Broward, Citrus, Collier, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Glades, Hendry, Hernando, Indian River, Lee, Martin, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Lucie, Sumter, and Volusia counties.All of Monroe County, where the Florida Keys are located, was placed under a mandatory evacuation.Residents in communities near the southern half of Lake Okeechobee were also ordered to leave.Additionally, voluntary evacuation notices were issued for all or parts of Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Charlotte, Columbia, Desoto, Hardee, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lake, Manatee, Okeechobee, Osceola, and Polk counties.\n\nA record 6.5 million Floridians evacuated, making it the largest evacuation in the state\'s history.Evacuees caused significant traffic congestion on northbound Interstate 95, Interstate 75, and Florida\'s Turnpike, exacerbated by the fact that the entire Florida peninsula was within the cone of uncertainty in the NHC\'s forecast path in the days before the storm, so evacuees from both coasts headed north, as evacuees would not be safer by fleeing to the opposite coast.Fuel was in short supply throughout peninsular Florida during the week before Irma\'s arrival, especially along evacuation routes, leading to hours-long lines at fuel stations and even escorts of fuel trucks by the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nUse of the left shoulder as a lane for moving traffic was allowed on northbound Interstate 75 from Wildwood to the Georgia state line beginning September 8 and on eastbound Interstate 4 from Tampa to State Road 429 near Celebration for a few hours on September 9.It was the first time that the shoulder-use plan, which was introduced at the start of the 2017 hurricane season, was implemented by the state for hurricane evacuations.The shoulder-use plan was implemented in place of labor- and resource-intensive contraflow lane reversal, in which both sides of an interstate highway are used for one direction of traffic.\n\nOfficials from the Environmental Protection Agency, which had been criticized for its response to Hurricane Harvey, took special measures to inspect and secure hazardous materials, especially at Superfund sites.Direct Relief, a disaster relief organization, coordinated with local health centers and provided resources to help facilities on the front lines of Floridian and Puerto Rican communities.\n\nGeorgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency initially for all six coastal counties on September 6, but eventually expanded the declaration to 94 counties south of Atlanta metropolitan area, and then the entire state on September 10.Atlanta was placed under its first-ever tropical storm warning.Governor Deal ordered mandatory evacuations for all areas east of Interstate 95 on September 7, before extending the order to the entirety of Chatham County and low-lying areas west of I-95 on the following day.In total, 540,000 people on the Georgia coast were ordered to leave.Contraflow lane reversal for Interstate 16 took effect on the morning of September 9 from Savannah to Dublin, Georgia.All Georgia state parks were open for free to evacuees, as was the 800-acre camping area at Atlanta Motor Speedway.Reversible HOT lanes on Interstate 75 in Georgia through south metro Atlanta were open 24 hours northbound with no tolls.\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on September 6, with South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster following suit the same day.Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency on September 8 in order to protect Virginia residents and to mobilize resources in support of neighboring states.Officials in New Orleans stated that there would not be much time for preparations if Irma failed to make the projected northward turn, but that South Texas or Florida would not be a good evacuation destination.On September 10, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam issued an executive order allowing medical professionals in other states to practice in Tennessee to aid Hurricane Irma evacuees.This order also allowed pharmacies to give out 14-day supplies of medicine, and gave women and children from outside the state the ability to participate in the Tennessee Department of Health programs.Bristol Motor Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway, and Charlotte Motor Speedway all opened their campgrounds to evacuees free of charge.\n\nIn professional sports, the Miami Dolphins–Tampa Bay Buccaneers game scheduled for September 10 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was postponed to November 19 due to the storm\'s threat.The Dolphins left early for their road game against the Los Angeles Chargers.The Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees moved their September 11–13 series from Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg to Citi Field in Queens.Minor League Baseball\'s Florida State League, Carolina League, and Southern League called off their championship finals and as a result, named their division series winners league co-champions.The Miami FC versus San Francisco Deltas match on September 10 was cancelled so the players and staff could prepare for the storm with their families.The Orlando Pride of the National Women\'s Soccer League rescheduled their September 9 match to September 7. Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer did not have any scheduled home games in September, but was unable to return to training facilities in Orlando due to Hurricane Irma.\n\nIn college football, the UCF Knights-Memphis Tigers game scheduled for September 9 was moved to September 30, replacing UCF\'s game against Maine and Memphis game against Georgia State.UCF also cancelled their game against Georgia Tech on September 16, as UCF\'s stadium hosted the National Guard.The USF Bulls-Connecticut Huskies football game was also cancelled.The Miami Hurricanes–Arkansas State Redwolves game scheduled for September 9 at Centennial Bank Stadium in Arkansas was canceled due to travel concerns for the University of Miami.The Florida Gators-Northern Colorado Bears match in Gainesville scheduled for September 9 was cancelled.The Florida State Seminoles contest against the Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks was canceled on September 8.The Seminoles\' rivalry game with the Hurricanes in Tallahassee, originally scheduled for September 16, was postponed tp October 7.The FIU Panthers game against the Alcorn State Braves was moved up a day and relocated to Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.The Georgia Southern Eagles game against the New Hampshire Wildcats on September 9 was also moved to Legion Field for that day.\n\nAs of September 5, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding was running dangerously low, due to its response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas the previous week, prompting the Trump administration to request an immediate $8 billion in additional funding as Irma approached Florida.Given the rate that current funds are being consumed and the catastrophic damage, the United States Senate almost doubled the requested amount to $15.3 billion, with the understanding that this would only be about 10% of what will be required for responding to Harvey.\n\nHurricane Irma\'s path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating, with landfalls in Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Martin, the Bahamas, Cuba, and the United States, all at major hurricane intensity.Furthermore, the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences.Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria.\n\nThe eyewall of the hurricane moved over Barbuda near its record peak intensity early on September 6; a weather station observed a wind gust of .The same station also recorded a minimum barometric pressure of .The exact state of the island remained unclear for hours after Irma\'s passage, as downed phone lines ceased all communication with nearby islands.Later that afternoon, Prime Minister Gaston Browne surveyed the territory by helicopter, revealing an effectively uninhabitable island.Irma damaged or destroyed 95% of the structures on Barbuda, including its hospital, schools, and both of its hotels; it completely flattened some residential blocks while submerging others.The destruction rendered the island\'s sole airport and much of its infrastructure inoperative—including water and telecommunication services—which further hampered relief efforts.Property damage on Barbuda ranged from $150 million to $300 million.A total of three storm-related deaths were reported on the island.\n\nIn addition to the catastrophic impact on Barbuda\'s human residents, concern turned to the storm\'s effects on the island\'s wildlife.The island\'s only endemic bird, the near-threatened Barbuda warbler, numbered less than 2,000 individuals prior to the hurricane.For some time it was unknown if the warbler survived the hurricane or its aftermath; however within a few months it was confirmed that not only did the species survive, but the most of the birds survived the storm.Barbuda\'s Codrington Lagoon, home to the largest colony of magnificent frigatebirds in the Caribbean, with an estimated 2,500 nesting pairs, was also inundated by the storm surge.\n\nRemaining just outside of Irma\'s strongest windfield, Antigua sustained less severe damage, in the form of leveled roofs and fences, downed power poles and lines, and uprooted trees.Some street flooding also took place in low-lying areas.Three people were treated for minor storm-related injuries.Forensic disaster analysts from the Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM), a Germany-based risk management agency, estimate that economic losses for Antigua and Barbuda will exceed $120 million.\n\nOn the morning of September 6, Irma\'s center crossed the island of Saint Martin while the storm was at peak intensity, sweeping away entire structures, submerging roads and cars, and triggering an island-wide blackout.Irma\'s extreme winds ripped trees out of the ground and sent vehicles and debris from damaged structures scattered across the territory.On the French side of Saint-Martin, entire marinas around Marigot were left in ruins, littered with the stranded remnants of boats that had smashed into each other.A hotel caught on fire, but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze.Another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor.Media images depicted devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds had shattered their windows.Irma killed four people on the French side of the island and injured 50 others, one of whom was in critical condition.As many as 95% of the buildings there were damaged to some degree; 60% of those were totally uninhabitable.Estimates from CEDIM indicate a minimum of $950 million worth of economic losses.Total losses exceeded €3.5 billion (US$4.17 billion).\n\nA similar situation unfolded in Sint Maarten, Saint Martin\'s Dutch half, as intense winds ripped through buildings and lifted vehicles aloft ""as if they were matches"".The hurricane wreaked havoc on Princess Juliana International Airport, with ""huge chunks of the building [strewn] across the runway and a jet bridge snapped in half.""It demolished or severely damaged about 70% of Sint Maarten\'s houses, forcing thousands of residents into public shelters.There were 4 deaths and 23 injuries, 11 of which were serious, in the Dutch territory.Irma is considered the worst natural disaster to hit Sint Maarten; the extent of its damage far exceeded that of any previous hurricane.Total damages were estimated at €2.5 billion (US$2.98 billion).\n\nIrma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the French island of Saint Barthélemy, southeast of Saint Martin.Describing the extent of the destruction, one local compared it to ""a bomb that burned all vegetation,"" while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively ""erased the island from the map"".Violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments, with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation.Streets in the capital of Gustavia were turned into rushing rivers, which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture.The island\'s fire station was inundated with up to of flood waters.With scores of homes and much of the infrastructure destroyed, the majority of the island\'s population was left stranded and without water, electricity or phone service.The associated economic losses could exceed $480 million according to CEDIM\'s analysts.\n\nPreliminary assessments from the French government indicate that Hurricane Irma caused a combined €1.2 billion (US$1.43 billion) in insured losses across the French territories of Saint-Martin and Saint Barts.This total covered private property such as homes, vehicles and businesses (including lost revenue); the extent of the damage to infrastructural and public facilities remains undetermined.Nonetheless, this made Irma one of the costliest natural disasters to hit the French Republic in 50 years.\n\nOn January 30, 2018, roughly five months after Irma, an analysis was published indicating that an anemometer on the island recorded an unofficial gust to before failing.\n\nThe British Overseas Territory of Anguilla saw the eyewall of the storm pass over it on September 6.Many homes and schools were destroyed, and the island\'s only hospital was badly damaged.The devastation was particularly severe in East End, where the winds uprooted scores of trees and power poles and demolished a number of houses.In The Valley, the island\'s capital, the hurricane blew out the windows of government buildings.Rough seas inflicted heavy damage upon several bays and harbors, and a seaside restaurant was completely eradicated.About 90% of roads were left impassable.The island\'s air traffic control tower was damaged, exacerbating the already poor communication with the island.One death was reported on the island.Estimates of losses on the island total at least $190 million.\n\nLarge swells ahead of Irma washed ashore debris and sea life in Castries, Saint Lucia, blocking some roads.Seaside roads were inundated with water.One surfer was killed amid rough surf in Barbados after hitting a reef and breaking his neck.Trees were also destroyed.The hurricane\'s effects, such as violent seas and rattling trees, were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in Guadeloupe.Several houses were damaged.Around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm, leaving several communes in the dark without running water.Overall damage was limited to external parts of houses and trees that were blown onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seas.\n\nSaint Kitts and Nevis endured similar conditions to other islands.Blustery rainstorms triggered scattered power outages and disabled the island\'s water system, but per the International Red Cross, the islands were spared the level of destruction seen elsewhere.Still, Prime Minister Timothy Harris stated that property and infrastructure had sustained ""significant damage.""The Dutch territories of Saba and Sint Eustatius were also struck by the hurricane\'s winds, resulting in infrastructural damage, water shortages and telecommunication outages.Several houses were left uninhabitable.On Saba, the hurricane also defoliated trees and injured a few people.CEDIM\'s analysts expect economic losses of $20–65 million for the two islands.\n\nDamage in the British Virgin Islands was extensive.Numerous buildings and roads were destroyed on the island of Tortola, which bore the brunt of the hurricane\'s core.Four people were confirmed dead.Along Cane Garden Bay, the storm surge submerged several seaside bars and a gas station.Satellite images revealed many of the island\'s residential zones had been left in ruins.The hurricane passed over Necker Island, also causing severe damage and destroying the mansion of Richard Branson.\n\nMost homes and businesses were destroyed on the island of Jost Van Dyke, the smallest of the B.V.I.\'s four main islands.The Governor, Gus Jaspert, who had only been sworn into office 13 days previously, declared a state of emergency - the first time this has ever happened in the Territory.After the storm, restoration of electricity took approximately 5 months.\n\nIrma\'s effects in the U.S. Virgin Islands were most profound on Saint Thomas, where at least of rain fell, and on Saint John.Saint Thomas island suffered widespread structural damage, including to its police station and airport.Patients from the fourth and third floors of Charlotte Amalie\'s hospital had to be relocated to lower floors due to flooding from roof leaks.Three deaths were attributed to Irma on the island.On nearby Saint Croix, there were communication issues and some damage to the infrastructure.Saint John lost access to ferry and cargo services, along with access to the local airport.Due to its normal reliance on electricity from Saint Thomas, the island was left without power.Total damage from the three islands was at least $1.1 billion.\n\nThe hurricane passed north of Puerto Rico, but still caused significant damage to the United States territory.Along the coast, a tide gauge observed waves up to mean higher high water.Much of the main island experienced sustained tropical storm force winds, with a peak sustained wind speed of at a weather station along San Juan Bay, while the same site observed a peak wind gust of .However, on the island of Culebra, a wind gust of was reported.Mainly due to strong winds, approximately 1.1 million out of 1.5 million of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority\'s customers lost electricity.Portions of Puerto Rico received heavy rainfall, with a peak total of in Bayamón, causing seven rivers to reach flood stage, widespread flash flooding, and at least six landslides.\n\nThe most severely affected areas included the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques, as well as the northeastern, northern, and mountainous portions of the main island.On Culebra, the island suffered an almost complete loss of electrical and water services.At least 30 homes on the island were destroyed, while about 30 other experienced substantial damage.High winds also toppled a number of trees.The only telecommunications tower on Culebra sustained damage, cutting off outside communications for several hours.In rural Loíza, 79 homes were destroyed.Throughout Puerto Rico, 781 out of 1,600 telecommunications towers went out of commission, primarily due to power outages.At least 362,000 customers lost water services.Debris, mostly fallen trees, blocked at least 72 roads.Approximately 25% to 30% of banana, coffee, papaya, and plantain crops were damaged by strong winds, with losses to farmers estimated at $30.6 million.Approximately 1,530 homes experienced at least moderate damage, with 1,448 homes moderately damaged, 32 extensively damaged, and 50 completely destroyed.\n\nHurricane Irma was attributed to around $1 billion in damage, and the NHC attributed three fatalities to Irma in Puerto Rico, though four deaths were related to the storm.Two people died due to rainstorms ahead of the hurricane: one man died in Orocovis after falling off his ladder while repairing his roof; another man on the coast in Capitanejo died after being struck by lightning.Three nearby fishermen were burned by the same lightning strike, but survived.Two other people died during the hurricane: a woman died while being evacuated from her house in a wheelchair and fell, hitting her head; another person died in a car accident in Canóvanas.Governor Ricardo Rosselló declared the islands of Culebra and Vieques to be disaster areas.\n\nAlthough spared a direct hit, both the Dominican Republic and Haiti were affected by high winds and heavy rains.A bridge over the Dajabón River connecting the two countries was broken.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, the fishing community of Nagua sustained damage from waves that destroyed homes.55,000 soldiers were deployed to affected areas to help with the clean-up efforts.By the evening of September 7, the government had counted 2,721 damaged homes.\n\nIn Haiti, flooding one meter deep sat in residential neighborhoods in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives.Mudslides, destroyed homes, flooded crops, and infrastructure damage were reported in the northern part of the country.The total expanse of the flooding stretched from Môle-Saint-Nicolas in the west to the eastern border with the Dominican Republic.\n\nOn the evening of September 7, at 7:30 pm AST (23:30 UTC), Hurricane Irma reached the Turks and Caicos Islands.While the eye passed just south of the main islands, crossing over South Caicos and the Ambergris Cays, the most powerful winds on the northern side of the eye swept all of the islands for more than two hours.Communications infrastructure was destroyed.\n\nOn September 8, Minister of Infrastructure Goldray Ewing confirmed that damage to Providenciales was extensive, with the northwestern neighborhood of Blue Hill being ""gone"".The hospital in the capital, Cockburn Town, was heavily damaged.On South Caicos, 75% of roofs were lost.Total damage was estimated at over $500 million.\n\nIn the Bahamas, the eye of the storm passed over Duncan Town, the major settlement of the Ragged Islands chain, on September 8.It also passed ""almost directly over"" Inagua and South Acklins, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.\n\nDamages were largely confined to the southern islands starting the morning of September 8.On Mayaguana and Great Inagua, downed power lines knocked out communications.On Great Inagua, 70% of homes sustained roof damage, and the island\'s school lost its roof entirely.The Morton Salt Company\'s signature production facility, one of the major employers in the country, experienced millions of dollars in damages.The Acklins settlement of Salina Point was cut off from the rest of the island by flooding, while Crooked Island had widespread roof damage.In the northern Bahamas, the worst property damage came on September 10 as the outer bands of the system produced tornadic activity on Grand Bahama and Bimini.Damage and losses across The Bahamas amounted to $135 million.\n\nWhile Irma was making landfall in Florida, the ocean was drawn away from some western shorelines of the Bahamas due to strong easterly winds.\n\nEarly on September 9, Irma made landfall on the Camagüey Archipelago off the northern coast of Cuba, with sustained winds of .The strongest official sustained wind speed was , while the highest wind gust reached ; both were observed near Camila in Ciego de Ávila Province.The weather station at Esmeralda, Camagüey, was damaged, with the wind gauge destroyed.The north coast of Cuba experienced significant coastal flooding due to storm surge and abnormally high tides generated by the storm.Wave heights at Cayo Romano exceeded .Storm surge penetrated as far as inland in some areas of Villa Clara Province.Multiple locations on the island observed at least of rainfall, with a peak total of of precipitation at Topes de Collantes.\n\nA total of 158,554 homes experienced some degree of damage, of which 14,657 were destroyed; approximately 1.9 million people experienced the direct effects of Irma.The storm partially deroofed 103,691 homes, while 23,560 were completely deroofed.Irma damaged or destroyed 980 health facilities and 2,264 schools.Approximately 3.1 million people experienced disruptions to the water supply, while 246,707 people lost telephone service.About of roads were damaged.Crops also suffered extensively, with nearly affected by the storm.Throughout the country, the hurricane inflicted $13.185 billion in damage and killed 10 people, making Irma the costliest tropical cyclone in Cuban history.\n\nThe tourist areas of Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and Cayo Santa María and the nearby town of Caibarién received the brunt of the storm, with waves rolling through town and the characteristic one-story homes completely flooded.The storm most severely Ciego de Ávila and Villa Clara provinces.Flooding worsened as the hurricane moved west, pushing the storm surge along to the regions around Havana.By the afternoon, limited flooding was occurring in Havana, including around the Malecón.Portions of province coastal flooding surpassing that which was experienced during the Storm of the Century in 1993 and Hurricane Wilma in 2005.In the city of Santa Clara, 39 buildings collapsed.Rainfall resulted in several rivers reaching major flood stage.The town of Cabaiguán in Sancti Spíritus Province in particular suffered extensive inland flooding after the Zaza River swelled.\n\nHurricane Irma directly affected a major colony of American flamingos on Cuba\'s northern Cayo Coco.Early reports from Diario de Cuba indicated that several hundred flamingos had been killed by the storm, though other estimates ranged as high as several thousand birds.\n\nHurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida.Except for the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned.Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba, but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys.The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States.After surveying the aftermath of Irma, Florida governor Rick Scott said ""I thought we would see more damage""[on the mainland] but said ""he witnessed devastation in the Keys"".President Donald Trump commented on Twitter that the devastation in some places was ""far greater than anyone thought"".\n\nDamage in the United States was estimated at a minimum of $50 billion.At the time, Irma was the fourth costliest tropical cyclone in the United States, behind hurricanes Sandy in 2012, Harvey earlier that year, and Katrina in 2005.However, later in September 2017, Hurricane Maria became the third costliest United States tropical cyclone, causing Irma to fall to the fifth costliest.At least 92 people, 10 directly and 82 indirectly, died throughout the United States in relation to Irma: 84 in Florida, 3 in Georgia, 3 in South Carolina, and 2 in North Carolina.\n\nIrma struck the state less than two weeks after Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten had caused the worst flooding seen in western Florida in 20 years, which further worsened the impacts in the region.The storm\'s large wind field resulted in strong winds across much of Florida, except for the western Panhandle.The highest reported sustained wind speed was on Marco Island, while the strongest observed wind gust was , recorded near Naples, though wind gusts of likely occurred in the Middle Florida Keys.More than 7.7 million homes and businesses in Florida were left without electricity at some point – approximately 73% of state.Generally heavy amounts of rainfall were recorded to the east of the Irma\'s path, including a peak total of in Fort Pierce.Heavy precipitation – and storm surge, in some instances – overflowed at least 32 rivers and creeks, causing significant flooding, particularly along the St. Johns River and its tributaries.Many homes and businesses suffered damage or destruction, with more than 65,000 structures damaged to some degree in West Central and Southwest Florida alone.Agriculture experienced about $2.5 billion in damage.It was estimated that the cyclone caused at least $50 billion in damage, making Irma the costliest hurricane in Florida history, surpassing Hurricane Andrew, until it was itself surpassed by Hurricane Ian, 5 years later.\n\nThroughout Florida, at least 84 people died in storm-related incidents.About half of the deaths occurred from drowning, trauma, and carbon monoxide poisoning.Broward County had 21 fatalities, the most of any county in Florida.Among those deaths were 12 people at The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, a Hollywood nursing home.The patients died from sweltering heat worsened by the lack of air conditioning.The hurricane also left at least 14 deaths in Monroe County; 6 deaths in Orange County; 5 deaths each in Duval, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties; 4 deaths in both Highlands and Hillsborough counties; 3 deaths in both Marion and Polk counties; 2 deaths each in Collier, Hardee, Leon, Pinellas, St. Lucie, and Taylor counties; and 1 death in Hendry, Lake, Lee, Liberty, Manatee, Nassau, Okeechobee, Pasco, Seminole, St. Johns, and Volusia counties.\n\nWith Irma making landfall in Monroe County as a Category 4 hurricane, the Florida Keys were hardest hit area in the state.Strong winds and storm surge flooding caused major damage to buildings, trailer parks, boats, roads, the electricity supply, mobile phone coverage, internet access, sanitation, the water supply and the fuel supply throughout the island chain.An estimated storm surge occurred at Cudjoe Key, where Irma made landfall.Throughout the island, 625 homes sustained minor damage, 52 sustained major damage, and 81 were demolished.On Big Pine Key, one of the most devastated islands, 633 homes received minor impact, 299 homes received major impact, and 473 homes were completely destroyed.Overall in Monroe County, 27,649 homes experienced some degree of damage, including 1,179 homes being destroyed, 2,977 homes receiving major damage, and 5,361 suffering minor damage.\n\nAfter devastating the Keys, the storm then struck Collier County as a Category 3 hurricane.Several communities in the county suffered extensive damage, especially along the coast.Throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, 65 homes, including 44 mobile homes, were demolished, while 1,008 homes received major damage.Property damages in unincorporated areas alone reach about $320 million.Lee County was lashed by strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused prolonged flooding in some areas.More than 24,000 homes suffered some degree of damage, with almost 3,000 homes receiving major damage and 89 homes being destroyed.Damage in the county totaled about $857 million.\n\nImpact in much of the Miami metropolitan area was generally limited to extensive tree and fence damage, as well as widespread power outages.However, in Miami-Dade County, about 1,000 homes received major damage and about 50% of crops were lost.Storm surge caused coastal flooding from Homestead to Downtown Miami, as well as in portions of Miami Beach.Parts of the Florida Heartland were devastated by high winds and flooding, particularly Hendry and Highlands counties.In the former, which has most citrus trees of any county in Florida, about 60% of orange crops were lost.Throughout Hendry County, a total of 451 homes had minor damage, 131 homes suffered major damage, and 42 others were destroyed.In Highlands County, 13,138 businesses and homes were damaged to some degree, with 144 being destroyed, 963 sustaining major damage, and 2,408 receiving minor damage.In Orange County, wind gusts reached 79 mph at Orlando International Airport.A wind gust of 91 mph was also recorded in Orlando at the top of the Disney Contemporary Resort.Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central Florida left some wind damage and flooding, necessitating evacuations and rescues, including more than 200 people in Orlo Vista after hundreds of homes were flooded.A total of 2,999 business or homes were damaged in Lake County, 7,430 in Seminole County, and 3,457 in Volusia County.Additionally, eight tornadoes touched down in Brevard County, all of which caused damage.\n\nAlong much of the Gulf Coast of Florida, to the north of where Irma made landfall, negative storm surges were observed, with water retracting rather than pushing inland, causing little coastal flooding.However, on the opposite coast, extensive erosion and storm surge flooding occurred in the First Coast, especially in Duval and St. Johns counties.In Duval County, the St. Johns River crested at heights that exceeded records set during Hurricane Dora in 1964.Portions of Jacksonville experienced flooding, particularly the downtown area and the Riverside and San Marco neighborhoods, with about 350 people rescued in those sections of the city.Water reached about high in some homes.The city of Jacksonville suffered about $85 million in damage.\n\nIn St. Johns County, storm surge left extensive damage to oceanfront properties in Ponte Vedra Beach and Vilano Beach, with several becoming uninhabitable.Additionally, some riverfront businesses in St. Augustine\'s historic district were flooded due to storm surge from the Matanzas River.In nearby Clay County, rainfall and storm surge combined to cause extensive flooding along portions of the Black Creek and the St. Johns River, with record high crests at several locations along the former.About 350 people and 75 animals were rescued from floodwaters throughout the county.A total of 275 homes were destroyed, 175 were inflicted major damage, and 124 received minor damage.\n\nThree deaths were reported in Georgia due to falling trees and debris, along with widespread wind damage and power outages throughout the state primarily due to fallen trees.On Tybee Island, as well as St. Simons Island the storm surge caused extensive flooding.The tropical storm also did $54 million in damage in the state.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the third highest storm surge on record was recorded, reaching a height of approximately .By of September 12, almost 100,000 had lost power in Upstate South Carolina.Five people died in storm-related incidents across South Carolina, all from indirect incidents.The tropical storm caused damages totaling $500,000 in the state.\n\nLight damage occurred in other areas, including Tennessee.About 75,000 customers in North Carolina lost power due to Irma.It also caused $600,000 in damages in Alabama.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Irma\'s path through the West Indies and Caribbean, the devastation to roads, harbors and airports significantly impeded the transportation and distribution of relief supplies.Foreign countries moved to provide much of the initial aid.The British, Dutch, French, and United States governments sent warships and planes with supplies and manpower to the region.International leaders, including Dutch King Willem-Alexander and French President Emmanuel Macron, quickly moved to visit affected territories.\n\nSome of the affected countries and territories also offered assistance to each other.Cuba, which sustained extensive damage from the storm, sent 750 health workers to Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, Dominica, and Haiti.Government officials and members of the public in Puerto Rico delivered assistance and evacuated people stranded on other islands.The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services granted special 30-day humanitarian visas for British Virgin Islanders to stay in Puerto Rico.Hundreds of people stranded on Saint Martin were flown to the Dominican Republic on humanitarian grounds.\n\nIn response to Hurricane Jose\'s approach, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a mandatory evacuation on September 9 for any remaining residents on Barbuda.A Miami cargo plane landed on Antigua later that day, carrying over 60 tons (120,000 lbs) of relief supplies for the displaced storm victims—including bottled water, canned food and power generators.\n\nRFA Mounts Bay stationed itself near Anguilla and provided support and relief work to the island with its helicopters and 40 marines and army engineers.The ship delivered 6 tonnes of emergency aid to Anguilla and army engineers repaired a fuel leak at Anguilla\'s main petrol dump, restored power to the island\'s hospital and provided shelters for those left homeless by the hurricane.The ship arrived in the British Virgin Islands on September 8, 2017, to provide emergency relief to the islands, including providing shelters, food and water.HMS Ocean was diverted from the Mediterranean to provide relief from Gibraltar to the affected British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos on September 7, and aid was also supplied by the Department for International Development from their disaster response centre at Kemble Airfield.As part of a £32 million operation named Operation Ruman, nearly 500 UK military personnel with emergency relief were dispatched from RAF Brize Norton.This included the first deployment of No. 38 Expeditionary Air Wing with 3 RAF aircraft; 2 Airbus A400M Atlas and 1 C130J hercules to support relief efforts.\n\nThe British government also drafted 2 members of the UK police calibre into the region on September 10, and 53 police officers were drafted from RAF Brize Norton to the affected British Overseas Territories on September 15 to help maintain order.UK politicians, including the chairs of the foreign affairs and development select committees, criticized both the government\'s preparations for the storm and its response as inadequate.\n\nBy September 12, the Department for International Development had delivered more than 40 tonnes of aid into the region, including into Turks and Caicos, and 1,000 UK military troops were deployed in the region as part of relief efforts.The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, pledged an additional £25 million worth of funding as part of relief efforts in the region on September 13, 2017, and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Boris Johnson, said that a further 250 UK military personnel would be deployed into the area within the next few days.Anguilla\'s Chief Minister, Victor Banks, praised the British government\'s response to the storm and said that Boris Johnson\'s visit to the island ""sends a very positive signal to Anguillans that the British are serious about their response to this very severe hurricane"", but went on to say that the current financial commitment from the UK was not substantial enough.\n\nBy September 15, the United Kingdom had over 70 military personnel and 4 police officers in Anguilla and had delivered 15 tonnes of aid to the island.In the British Virgin Islands, Royal Marines had cleared the airfield so that it was operational for the delivery of aid into the islands, with more than 200 British military personnel and 54 UK police officers on the ground and 8 tonnes of aid delivered to the islands.120 British military personnel were on the ground in Turks and Caicos, and over 150 shelter kits and 720 liters of water were delivered to the islands on September 15.\n\nAmendments to international aid rules by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (or OECD) allowed for the UK government to provide access to £13 billion worth of aid to the affected British Overseas Territories, through the UK\'s Official Development Assistance (ODA) by November 2017.\n\nBy the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage.The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by Irma\'s eye, remained largely inaccessible for days.Assessments showed that 15% of the national telecommunications network had been affected, with at least one tower destroyed.Bahamasair resumed a limited domestic schedule on September 10, with international flights still cancelled due to existing and anticipated destruction at other destinations.\n\nThe worst devastation occurred on Ragged Island, over which Irma\'s eye had directly passed.After days of the National Emergency Management Agency not being able to physically reach the island, officials were finally able to inspect it; they promptly declared it uninhabitable.Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said that it was the worst disaster area he or his officials had ever seen, and that all remaining residents would need to leave, potentially permanently.Business leaders and other officials called for a new long-term development model to shift the population away from such sparsely-settled islands.\n\nOn Grand Bahama and Bimini, where tornadoes associated with Irma touched down on September 10, more than 100 people were left displaced.Infrastructure damage included docks, parks, and the power system.\n\nAside from tangible asset losses, Irma brought significant economic damages.International freight shipping was projected to be offline for a week, and costs for rebuilding supplies were inflated due to demand in the U.S.\n\nSwollen rivers contributed to worsening flooding in the days after the storm system left, resulting in additional evacuations.Officials resorted to using inflatable rafts to access affected areas.The national electrical infrastructure was said to be extensively damaged.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, flooding worsened following Irma\'s departure, leading the number of displaced persons to increase to more than 24,000 by September 8.President Danilo Medina ordered further evacuations due to at-risk dams, while the government banned swimming in rivers and ordered boats kept in port.More than 422,000 people were left without water due to 28 aqueducts being damaged.\n\nIn Haiti, officials stated that losses were greater than they could have been since people largely did not heed early preparation and evacuation warnings.At least 5,000 homes were flooded.One man died trying to cross a flooded river; another went missing and 17 were injured.The trash- and waste-contaminated floodwaters in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives led to fears of cholera outbreaks.Flooding continued to worsen days after the storm, as runoff from the mountains swelled rivers in low-lying farming communities.United Nations peacekeepers from Brazil were able to gain access to the flooded northwest region to provide urgent aid, but non-governmental organizations and Haitian economists warned that the estimated 30,000 victims would need longer-term assistance as well.Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant appointed a government commission to address Irma\'s effects, with Action Against Hunger in charge of humanitarian coordination.\n\nIn the USVI, residents and tourists alike were described as being in a state of traumatic shock.By September 7, the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship had arrived in the USVI to provide supplies, damage assessment, and evacuation assistance.Four additional warships, some of which had already been on their way to Texas to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief, were redirected to the region.At a September 10 news conference, Governor Kenneth Mapp described Irma as a ""horrific disaster"" for which ""[t]here will be no restorations or solutions in days or weeks.""The Federal Emergency Management Agency airlifted in goods for residents, who were subjected to a curfew.Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line agreed to transport tourists to Florida, contingent upon port availability following the state\'s own experience with Irma.\n\nOn Saint John, described as ""perhaps the site of Irma\'s worst devastation on American soil,"" it took six days for an active-theater disaster zone to be established, leading to criticism of the U.S. government response.The National Guard was delayed in reaching Saint John due to the number of overturned boats left in the harbor.The National Guard was brought in to maintain order, while the Coast Guard brought evacuees to cruise ships bound for San Juan and Miami.There was still no electricity on St. John in the middle of October 2017.\n\nBy September 9, more than one million Puerto Ricans were still without power, tens of thousands were without water, and several thousand were still in shelters.Hospitals were operating on generator power.The government was struggling to establish contact with the islands of Culebra and Vieques.By September 10, the main island had recovered enough to serve as a refuge for people stranded on other islands, including 1,200 tourists from Saint Martin and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Airlifts had brought more than 50 patients to Puerto Rico.\n\nFive months after Irma, two-thirds of the hospital beds on Saint Thomas were still unavailable, due to extensive physical damage and staffing shortages.\n\nDamage to Sint Maarten\'s harbour and to Princess Juliana International Airport left the Dutch part of Saint Martin unreachable, although the smaller Grand Case-Espérance Airport on the French side could be reopened by September 7 for supply aid by helicopter and airplane.The French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops on board a CASA/IPTN CN-235 aircraft.\n\nThe following day, the Dutch military was able to airlift dialysis patients off the island while also dropping leaflets to warn islanders about the rapidly approaching Hurricane Jose.Although the airport was closed, 435 students and faculty of the American University of the Caribbean were evacuated by the U.S. military.On September 10, Dutch King Willem-Alexander departed for the region, with intentions to visit Sint Maarten and other affected Dutch territories and commonwealth members.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron followed this announcement by stating his intentions to visit the French part of the island on September 12 in order to bring aid supplies.In response to criticism of the French handling of the disaster, 1,000 troops, police, and other emergency workers were sent to Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.\n\nOn both sides of Saint Martin, desperate conditions combined with food and water shortages in Irma\'s aftermath led to reports of violence, scavenging, and theft.In response, the French government increased its troop deployment to 2,200 and the Dutch government sent more than 600 military and police personnel.\n\nThe day after the hurricane hit Saint Barthelemy the French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops into the reopened Grand Case-Espérance Airport.On September 7 and 9, equipment and personnel were flown from France to Guadeloupe and Martinique.\n\nSporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm.\n\nOn September 11, Florida Governor Rick Scott conducted an aerial tour to survey the damage to the Keys.The Overseas Highway remained closed while authorities assessed the integrity of the 42 bridges along the route.Residents returning to the Keys were faced with a police roadblock, to the south of Florida City.USS Iwo Jima, USS New York and aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were sent to the Keys area to aid with the recovery.\n\nOn September 12, some residents were allowed to return into the Keys as far as Islamorada.Although road damage blocked entry any farther than Islamorada, bridges had been inspected and found safe to Sugarloaf Key.By late on September 12, the Overseas Highway had been repaired and the bridges inspected as safe for first responders to travel to Key West.On September 16, residents were free to return to Marathon.Residents were allowed to return to Key West the following day, although the Keys remained closed to tourists and a checkpoint remained in place in Florida City.\n\nDue mainly to the widespread loss of power, cell phone service was also reduced after battery backup power for cell phone towers ran out and backup generators ran out of fuel.In an impact report by the FCC, as of 11 AM EDT on September 12, 89 of 108 (82%) cell phone towers were non-functioning in Monroe County (Florida Keys), 154 of 212 (73%) were non-functioning in Collier County (Naples), 36 of 46 (78%) were non-functioning in Hendry County, and an additional six counties had 41-60% of cell phone towers not functioning, including Lee County (Fort Myers) and Miami-Dade County.\n\nNOAA released map-format aerial reconnaissance image data of damage from the storm.The imagery featured several areas of Florida: including the Florida Keys, the southwest coast of Florida from Marco Island to Punta Gorda, much of the northeast coast of Florida, and portions of the Jacksonville area.Portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts were also photographed.Additionally, the Sun-Sentinel published before and after photos of several landmarks in the Florida Keys.\n\nIn the days after the hurricane, due to the heavy rainfall, numerous rivers had flooded, including residential areas.Public health risks, such as diarrheal infections and mosquito-borne illnesses, remain from the flooding that resulted in the aftermath of the hurricane.A large concern from flooding is contamination because people become exposed to dirty floodwaters and the potential for contaminated water to enter the local water supply is significant.One example of an illness that can enter the water supply is leptospirosis, which is rat urine carries into the floodwaters.Untreated exposure to leptospirosis can cause kidney damage, meningitis, and liver failure.Noroviruses and other infections are also a risk.\n\nFollowing Irma\'s passage, a hand-carved wooden canoe was discovered on the banks of the Indian River and could be several hundred years old.The state has removed the canoe for examination and safe keeping.\n\nDue to Irma\'s and Hurricane Harvey\'s impact in Florida and Texas, U.S. employment declined in September 2017 for the first time since September 2010.The leisure and hospitality industries were especially hard hit, losing 111,000 jobs in September.\n\nIrma set multiple records for intensity, especially at easterly longitudes, time spent at such an intensity, and its intensity at landfall.When Irma reached Category 5 intensity with winds of at 11:45 UTC on September 5 at 57.7°W, it became the easternmost Atlantic hurricane of this strength on record, surpassing Hurricane David of 1979, later beaten by Hurricane Lorenzo 2 years later.By 00:15 UTC on September 6, Irma reached peak intensity with () winds and a minimum pressure of .This ties it with Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and Hurricane Rita of 2005 as the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed.Only five other Atlantic hurricanes have been recorded with wind speeds higher than Irma: Hurricane Allen of 1980, which had maximum sustained winds of , and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Gilbert of 1988, Hurricane Wilma of 2005, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, all of which had peak winds of .At the time, Irma was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; later surpassed by Hurricane Dorian, and was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007.In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category 5 strength winds, and the third-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, with a value of 64.9 units.Only the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane and Hurricane Ivan in 2004 achieved higher values.\n\nOn September 6, Irma made landfall on the islands of Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Virgin Gorda at peak strength.This ties Irma with cyclones Monica of 2006 and Winston of 2016, and typhoons Zeb of 1998 and Megi of 2010 as the seventh-strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall globally – in terms of sustained winds – trailing only Typhoon Goni of 2020 which bore winds of at landfall, Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 and Typhoon Meranti of 2016, which bore winds of at landfall, and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Typhoon Joan of 1959, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, which bore winds of at landfall.Irma is second to the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin, and is the first hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic at Category 5 status since Felix in 2007.Irma is the first recorded Category 5 hurricane to affect the northern Leeward Islands, and was one of the worst storms to hit the region on record, along with Hurricane Donna in 1960 and Hurricane Luis in 1995.In addition, Irma is only the second hurricane on record to make landfall in Cuba at Category 5 intensity, with the other being a hurricane in 1924.Furthermore, when Irma made landfall on Barbuda, Saint Martin, Virgin Gorda, and Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane, it became one of only two recorded Atlantic storms to make landfall in multiple nations at this strength; the other was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which struck both Eleuthera and the United States as a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nIrma made landfall in the Florida Keys with winds of and a pressure of , making it the strongest hurricane to strike Florida in terms of wind speed since Charley in 2004, and the most intense to strike the state in terms of barometric pressure since Andrew in 1992.In the span of two weeks, two Category 4 hurricanes—Harvey and Irma—struck the continental United States, the first time on record two Atlantic tropical cyclones of such strength made landfall on the country in the same hurricane season.This also marked only the third occurrence of two consecutive Atlantic storms making landfall in the United States as major hurricanes.The other two instances were the Great Charleston and Cheniere Caminada hurricanes in 1893, and hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne in 2004.\n\nBecause of the extensive damage and loss of life the hurricane caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Irma from its rotating naming lists in April 2018, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane.It was replaced with Idalia for the 2023 season.\n\nWeather of 2017 Tropical cyclones in 2017 List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes Operation RUMAN – UK military-civil disaster relief response to Hurricane Irma.List of Cuba hurricanes List

one in Barbados; three in Barbuda; four in the British Virgin Islands; 10 in Cuba; 11 in the French West Indies; one in Haiti; three in Puerto Rico; four on the Dutch side of Sint Maarten; 92 in the contiguous United States, and four in the U.S. Virgin Islands.Hurricane Irma was the top Google searched term in the U.S. and globally in 2017.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa on August 26.The tropical wave moved off the coast of the continent late on August 27.Throughout the next two days, showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low-pressure area, as the system passed just south of and then through the Cape Verde Islands on August 29.Around 00:00 UTC on the following day, the system developed into a tropical depression just west of the Cape Verde Islands.Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Irma, based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates.With warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, strengthening was anticipated, with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier air.\n\nThe nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow, as an anticyclone became established over the system, with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images.Early on August 31, shortly after the development of a central dense overcast (CDO) and an eye feature, Irma underwent rapid intensification, becoming a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 UTC and then a Category 3 hurricane, becoming a major hurricane – around 00:00 UTC on September 1.Within a 48-hour period, the hurricane\'s intensity had increased by .On September 2, a ship passed to the west of the center of Irma, recording maximum winds of , which indicated that the eye of Irma remained compact.A strong high pressure system to the north of Irma caused the storm to move west-southwestward between September 2 and September 4.The first aircraft reconnaissance mission departed from Barbados on the afternoon of September 3, discovering an eye in diameter and surface winds of .\n\nOn September 4, after moving into more favorable conditions, Irma strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane.As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by 12:00 UTC on the following day, with winds of .The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at near 18:00 UTC on September 5. Irma acquired annular characteristics around this time, with the storm exhibiting a large, symmetric CDO and an impressive satellite appearance.Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern Leeward Islands.Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of Barbuda at peak intensity, with the storm\'s central minimum pressure having bottomed out at – this was the lowest in the Atlantic since Dean in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of .Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15 UTC on Sint Maarten, and at 16:30 UTC on Virgin Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands, though the storm\'s central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall.\n\nAs the hurricane moved away from the Virgin Islands late on September 6, observations from reconnaissance flights, as well as Doppler radar in San Juan, Puerto Rico, indicated an elliptical eye and double eyewalls.Late on September 6, the cyclone passed about north of Puerto Rico.Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of Hispaniola throughout the day on September 7.After beginning an eyewall replacement cycle, Irma weakened to a Category 4 hurricane as it passed south of the Turks and Caicos Islands early on September 8.This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category 5 intensity, the second-longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above – behind only the 1932 Cuba hurricane.At 05:00 UTC on September 8, Irma made landfall on the island of Little Inagua in the Bahamas with sustained winds of .The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a subtropical ridge to its north.Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category 5 intensity at 18:00 UTC that day east of Cuba as deep convection became more pronounced and organized.The hurricane then made landfall in Cayo Romano, Cuba, at 03:00 UTC on September 9, with winds of .This made Irma only the second Category 5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the 1924 Cuba hurricane.As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category 2 storm later on September 9.\n\nAfter slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards Florida around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental United States.Moving over the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, Irma quickly restrengthened to a Category 4 hurricane at 06:00 UTC on September 10, as deep convection improved and the eye became better defined.In addition, Irma\'s wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of and gale-force winds spanning in diameter.The cyclone made landfall in Cudjoe Key, Florida, at 13:00 UTC on September 10, at Category 4 intensity, with winds of .Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category 3 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30 UTC, in Marco Island, Florida, with sustained winds of .Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category 3 intensity hours after landfall.Passing east of Tampa as a weakening Category 1 hurricane around 06:00 UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation – though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds.The system finally weakened to a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC that day as it entered southern Georgia, while acquiring some extratropical characteristics.At 06:00 UTC on September 12, Irma degenerated to a remnant low just as it entered Alabama, as most of the deep convection had diminished.The remnants persisted for another day or so before dissipating over Missouri on September 13.\n\nGiven that Irma\'s forecast track was along much of the Caribbean island chain, hurricane warnings were issued for the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and parts of Hispaniola on September 5.\n\nIn Antigua and Barbuda, residents safeguarded their homes and cleaned up their properties in anticipation of strong winds.Emergency crews were put on standby at public shelters and hospitals by September 5 to assist with any evacuations.Expecting a direct hit, more than half of the residents on Barbuda took shelter, and relief supplies were preemptively mobilized.The National Emergency Management Organization on Saint Lucia urged small craft operators and swimmers to be mindful of forecasts for high surf.Small Craft Warnings and High Surf Advisories were hoisted for Dominica, where residents were urged to remain vigilant of the potential for high waves, landslides, and flooding.\n\nIn Guadeloupe, low-lying and cliff-edge homes were evacuated at the threat of flooding and erosion.Schools and public businesses closed on September 5 and 6.Hospitals stocked up on three days\' worth of supplies and checked the functionality of their generators.Of the island\'s 32 communes, 22 activated their emergency plans; 1,500 people were urged to take shelter.The island sustained relatively minor damage and became the base for relief efforts on Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.Though the core of the hurricane was expected to remain north of the island, a yellow alert was issued for Martinique due to the likelihood of rough seas.The island dispatched relief supplies and military reinforcements to its neighboring islands of Guadeloupe, Saint Martin.and Saint Barthélemy, which faced a greater risk of a direct impact.\n\nOn September 4, Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency.By September 6, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency had deployed response teams in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.Supplies, including food rations, medical supplies, and blankets, were pre-staged in strategic locations on the islands for distribution.\n\nOn September 5, the Dominican Republic activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage; the United States and Haiti followed suit two days later.According to officials, 11,200 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas prior to the storm\'s arrival.Approximately 7,400 tourists were moved to Santo Domingo, away from beach resorts.In Haiti, government officials and aid organizations struggled with early preparation and evacuation efforts.While some officials blamed reluctance and indifference on the part of the population, others ""admitted they were not prepared for the onslaught and no mandatory evacuation orders were in place ahead of Irma\'s approach.""Local officials contended that they had not received promised funds, supplies, or equipment from the national government.The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti prepared its 1,000 peacekeepers and engineers to assist.\n\nIn the Turks and Caicos, evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas starting September 5. Schools were closed, government buildings were boarded up, and shelters were opened.Officials spread warnings to residents in English, Creole, and Spanish via social media, radio, SMS text, and WhatsApp.In The Bahamas, the government began preparations the week prior to the hurricane\'s arrival, including securing national sports facilities to use as shelters.By September 7, the government had evacuated 1,609 people by air from the southern islands, including 365 from Bimini.Controlled cutting of the power supply to southern and central Bahamian islands was conducted in advance of the storm.Shelters were made available, though usage was low due to most evacuees staying with family on other islands.Of the 2,679 foreign tourists still in The Bahamas on September 7, about 1,200 were being housed at Atlantis Paradise Island, one of the most hurricane-ready structures in the country.\n\nIn Cuba, meteorologists did not initially predict a direct hit.Fuel conservation was enacted in Camagüey Province to ensure that enough would be available during post-storm power outages.The Civil Defense evacuated nearly one million people from low-lying areas, including thousands of Canadian and European tourists in the Jardines del Rey.Dolphins at a Cayo Guillermo resort were evacuated by helicopter.\n\nThe NHC issued several watches and warnings for the Southeastern United States.The first watches and warnings were issued at 15:00 UTC on September 7, which was a hurricane watch from the Jupiter Inlet to Bonita Beach, including the Florida Keys and Lake Okeechobee.The watches and warnings were extended into Georgia and South Carolina on September 9.At 21:00 UTC on that day, the advisories reached their maximum extent, with a hurricane warning covering the entire east coast of the state, the west coast from Indian Pass southward, and the Florida Keys; a hurricane watch was in place from the Florida–Georgia state line to Edisto Beach, South Carolina; and there were two tropical storm warnings, one in Florida from Indian Pass to the Okaloosa–Walton county line and the other from the Florida–Georgia state line to the South Santee River in South Carolina.Watches and warnings were gradually discontinued as Irma moved inland and weakened, with all of them canceled by early on September 12.\n\nOn September 4, Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency.Governor Scott placed 100 members of the Florida National Guard on duty to assist in preparations.All 7,000 troops were ordered to be on duty by September 8.Officials advised residents to stock their hurricane kits.The state coordinated with electrical companies in order for power outages to be restored as quickly as possible, extending resources such as equipment, fuel, and lodging for the approximately 24,000 restoration personnel who had been activated.Governor Scott suspended tolls on all toll roads in Florida, including the turnpike.All state offices in Florida were closed from September 8 to September 11, while public schools, state colleges, and state universities in all 67 counties were closed during the same period.The Florida Department of Education coordinated with school districts as the need for transportation by school buses and opening shelters arose.By September 9, more than 150 state parks were closed.Throughout the state, almost 700 emergency shelters were opened.The shelters collectively housed about 191,764 people, with more than 40% of them staying in a shelter in South Florida.Additionally, more than 60 special needs shelters were opened, which housed more than 5,000 people by September 9.\n\nMany airports across the state, particularly in Central and South Florida, were closed.Nearly 9,000 flights intending to arrive in or depart from Florida were canceled.Along Florida\'s coasts, most seaports were closed or opened with restricted access.For the fifth time in its 45-year history, the Walt Disney World Resort was completely closed due to the storm.Its theme parks, water parks, and Disney Springs were all closed by 9:00 p.m. on September 9 and remained closed until September 12.Other Orlando-area theme parks, including Universal Orlando Resort and SeaWorld Orlando, were also closed.The Kennedy Space Center was closed from September 8 to September 15.\n\nAn estimated 6.5 million Floridians were ordered to evacuate, mostly those living on barrier islands or in coastal areas; in mobile or sub-standard homes; and in low-lying or flood prone areas.Mandatory evacuations were ordered for portions of Brevard, Broward, Citrus, Collier, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Glades, Hendry, Hernando, Indian River, Lee, Martin, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Lucie, Sumter, and Volusia counties.All of Monroe County, where the Florida Keys are located, was placed under a mandatory evacuation.Residents in communities near the southern half of Lake Okeechobee were also ordered to leave.Additionally, voluntary evacuation notices were issued for all or parts of Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Charlotte, Columbia, Desoto, Hardee, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lake, Manatee, Okeechobee, Osceola, and Polk counties.\n\nA record 6.5 million Floridians evacuated, making it the largest evacuation in the state\'s history.Evacuees caused significant traffic congestion on northbound Interstate 95, Interstate 75, and Florida\'s Turnpike, exacerbated by the fact that the entire Florida peninsula was within the cone of uncertainty in the NHC\'s forecast path in the days before the storm, so evacuees from both coasts headed north, as evacuees would not be safer by fleeing to the opposite coast.Fuel was in short supply throughout peninsular Florida during the week before Irma\'s arrival, especially along evacuation routes, leading to hours-long lines at fuel stations and even escorts of fuel trucks by the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nUse of the left shoulder as a lane for moving traffic was allowed on northbound Interstate 75 from Wildwood to the Georgia state line beginning September 8 and on eastbound Interstate 4 from Tampa to State Road 429 near Celebration for a few hours on September 9.It was the first time that the shoulder-use plan, which was introduced at the start of the 2017 hurricane season, was implemented by the state for hurricane evacuations.The shoulder-use plan was implemented in place of labor- and resource-intensive contraflow lane reversal, in which both sides of an interstate highway are used for one direction of traffic.\n\nOfficials from the Environmental Protection Agency, which had been criticized for its response to Hurricane Harvey, took special measures to inspect and secure hazardous materials, especially at Superfund sites.Direct Relief, a disaster relief organization, coordinated with local health centers and provided resources to help facilities on the front lines of Floridian and Puerto Rican communities.\n\nGeorgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency initially for all six coastal counties on September 6, but eventually expanded the declaration to 94 counties south of Atlanta metropolitan area, and then the entire state on September 10.Atlanta was placed under its first-ever tropical storm warning.Governor Deal ordered mandatory evacuations for all areas east of Interstate 95 on September 7, before extending the order to the entirety of Chatham County and low-lying areas west of I-95 on the following day.In total, 540,000 people on the Georgia coast were ordered to leave.Contraflow lane reversal for Interstate 16 took effect on the morning of September 9 from Savannah to Dublin, Georgia.All Georgia state parks were open for free to evacuees, as was the 800-acre camping area at Atlanta Motor Speedway.Reversible HOT lanes on Interstate 75 in Georgia through south metro Atlanta were open 24 hours northbound with no tolls.\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on September 6, with South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster following suit the same day.Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency on September 8 in order to protect Virginia residents and to mobilize resources in support of neighboring states.Officials in New Orleans stated that there would not be much time for preparations if Irma failed to make the projected northward turn, but that South Texas or Florida would not be a good evacuation destination.On September 10, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam issued an executive order allowing medical professionals in other states to practice in Tennessee to aid Hurricane Irma evacuees.This order also allowed pharmacies to give out 14-day supplies of medicine, and gave women and children from outside the state the ability to participate in the Tennessee Department of Health programs.Bristol Motor Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway, and Charlotte Motor Speedway all opened their campgrounds to evacuees free of charge.\n\nIn professional sports, the Miami Dolphins–Tampa Bay Buccaneers game scheduled for September 10 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was postponed to November 19 due to the storm\'s threat.The Dolphins left early for their road game against the Los Angeles Chargers.The Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees moved their September 11–13 series from Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg to Citi Field in Queens.Minor League Baseball\'s Florida State League, Carolina League, and Southern League called off their championship finals and as a result, named their division series winners league co-champions.The Miami FC versus San Francisco Deltas match on September 10 was cancelled so the players and staff could prepare for the storm with their families.The Orlando Pride of the National Women\'s Soccer League rescheduled their September 9 match to September 7. Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer did not have any scheduled home games in September, but was unable to return to training facilities in Orlando due to Hurricane Irma.\n\nIn college football, the UCF Knights-Memphis Tigers game scheduled for September 9 was moved to September 30, replacing UCF\'s game against Maine and Memphis game against Georgia State.UCF also cancelled their game against Georgia Tech on September 16, as UCF\'s stadium hosted the National Guard.The USF Bulls-Connecticut Huskies football game was also cancelled.The Miami Hurricanes–Arkansas State Redwolves game scheduled for September 9 at Centennial Bank Stadium in Arkansas was canceled due to travel concerns for the University of Miami.The Florida Gators-Northern Colorado Bears match in Gainesville scheduled for September 9 was cancelled.The Florida State Seminoles contest against the Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks was canceled on September 8.The Seminoles\' rivalry game with the Hurricanes in Tallahassee, originally scheduled for September 16, was postponed tp October 7.The FIU Panthers game against the Alcorn State Braves was moved up a day and relocated to Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.The Georgia Southern Eagles game against the New Hampshire Wildcats on September 9 was also moved to Legion Field for that day.\n\nAs of September 5, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding was running dangerously low, due to its response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas the previous week, prompting the Trump administration to request an immediate $8 billion in additional funding as Irma approached Florida.Given the rate that current funds are being consumed and the catastrophic damage, the United States Senate almost doubled the requested amount to $15.3 billion, with the understanding that this would only be about 10% of what will be required for responding to Harvey.\n\nHurricane Irma\'s path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating, with landfalls in Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Martin, the Bahamas, Cuba, and the United States, all at major hurricane intensity.Furthermore, the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences.Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria.\n\nThe eyewall of the hurricane moved over Barbuda near its record peak intensity early on September 6; a weather station observed a wind gust of .The same station also recorded a minimum barometric pressure of .The exact state of the island remained unclear for hours after Irma\'s passage, as downed phone lines ceased all communication with nearby islands.Later that afternoon, Prime Minister Gaston Browne surveyed the territory by helicopter, revealing an effectively uninhabitable island.Irma damaged or destroyed 95% of the structures on Barbuda, including its hospital, schools, and both of its hotels; it completely flattened some residential blocks while submerging others.The destruction rendered the island\'s sole airport and much of its infrastructure inoperative—including water and telecommunication services—which further hampered relief efforts.Property damage on Barbuda ranged from $150 million to $300 million.A total of three storm-related deaths were reported on the island.\n\nIn addition to the catastrophic impact on Barbuda\'s human residents, concern turned to the storm\'s effects on the island\'s wildlife.The island\'s only endemic bird, the near-threatened Barbuda warbler, numbered less than 2,000 individuals prior to the hurricane.For some time it was unknown if the warbler survived the hurricane or its aftermath; however within a few months it was confirmed that not only did the species survive, but the most of the birds survived the storm.Barbuda\'s Codrington Lagoon, home to the largest colony of magnificent frigatebirds in the Caribbean, with an estimated 2,500 nesting pairs, was also inundated by the storm surge.\n\nRemaining just outside of Irma\'s strongest windfield, Antigua sustained less severe damage, in the form of leveled roofs and fences, downed power poles and lines, and uprooted trees.Some street flooding also took place in low-lying areas.Three people were treated for minor storm-related injuries.Forensic disaster analysts from the Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM), a Germany-based risk management agency, estimate that economic losses for Antigua and Barbuda will exceed $120 million.\n\nOn the morning of September 6, Irma\'s center crossed the island of Saint Martin while the storm was at peak intensity, sweeping away entire structures, submerging roads and cars, and triggering an island-wide blackout.Irma\'s extreme winds ripped trees out of the ground and sent vehicles and debris from damaged structures scattered across the territory.On the French side of Saint-Martin, entire marinas around Marigot were left in ruins, littered with the stranded remnants of boats that had smashed into each other.A hotel caught on fire, but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze.Another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor.Media images depicted devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds had shattered their windows.Irma killed four people on the French side of the island and injured 50 others, one of whom was in critical condition.As many as 95% of the buildings there were damaged to some degree; 60% of those were totally uninhabitable.Estimates from CEDIM indicate a minimum of $950 million worth of economic losses.Total losses exceeded €3.5 billion (US$4.17 billion).\n\nA similar situation unfolded in Sint Maarten, Saint Martin\'s Dutch half, as intense winds ripped through buildings and lifted vehicles aloft ""as if they were matches"".The hurricane wreaked havoc on Princess Juliana International Airport, with ""huge chunks of the building [strewn] across the runway and a jet bridge snapped in half.""It demolished or severely damaged about 70% of Sint Maarten\'s houses, forcing thousands of residents into public shelters.There were 4 deaths and 23 injuries, 11 of which were serious, in the Dutch territory.Irma is considered the worst natural disaster to hit Sint Maarten; the extent of its damage far exceeded that of any previous hurricane.Total damages were estimated at €2.5 billion (US$2.98 billion).\n\nIrma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the French island of Saint Barthélemy, southeast of Saint Martin.Describing the extent of the destruction, one local compared it to ""a bomb that burned all vegetation,"" while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively ""erased the island from the map"".Violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments, with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation.Streets in the capital of Gustavia were turned into rushing rivers, which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture.The island\'s fire station was inundated with up to of flood waters.With scores of homes and much of the infrastructure destroyed, the majority of the island\'s population was left stranded and without water, electricity or phone service.The associated economic losses could exceed $480 million according to CEDIM\'s analysts.\n\nPreliminary assessments from the French government indicate that Hurricane Irma caused a combined €1.2 billion (US$1.43 billion) in insured losses across the French territories of Saint-Martin and Saint Barts.This total covered private property such as homes, vehicles and businesses (including lost revenue); the extent of the damage to infrastructural and public facilities remains undetermined.Nonetheless, this made Irma one of the costliest natural disasters to hit the French Republic in 50 years.\n\nOn January 30, 2018, roughly five months after Irma, an analysis was published indicating that an anemometer on the island recorded an unofficial gust to before failing.\n\nThe British Overseas Territory of Anguilla saw the eyewall of the storm pass over it on September 6.Many homes and schools were destroyed, and the island\'s only hospital was badly damaged.The devastation was particularly severe in East End, where the winds uprooted scores of trees and power poles and demolished a number of houses.In The Valley, the island\'s capital, the hurricane blew out the windows of government buildings.Rough seas inflicted heavy damage upon several bays and harbors, and a seaside restaurant was completely eradicated.About 90% of roads were left impassable.The island\'s air traffic control tower was damaged, exacerbating the already poor communication with the island.One death was reported on the island.Estimates of losses on the island total at least $190 million.\n\nLarge swells ahead of Irma washed ashore debris and sea life in Castries, Saint Lucia, blocking some roads.Seaside roads were inundated with water.One surfer was killed amid rough surf in Barbados after hitting a reef and breaking his neck.Trees were also destroyed.The hurricane\'s effects, such as violent seas and rattling trees, were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in Guadeloupe.Several houses were damaged.Around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm, leaving several communes in the dark without running water.Overall damage was limited to external parts of houses and trees that were blown onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seas.\n\nSaint Kitts and Nevis endured similar conditions to other islands.Blustery rainstorms triggered scattered power outages and disabled the island\'s water system, but per the International Red Cross, the islands were spared the level of destruction seen elsewhere.Still, Prime Minister Timothy Harris stated that property and infrastructure had sustained ""significant damage.""The Dutch territories of Saba and Sint Eustatius were also struck by the hurricane\'s winds, resulting in infrastructural damage, water shortages and telecommunication outages.Several houses were left uninhabitable.On Saba, the hurricane also defoliated trees and injured a few people.CEDIM\'s analysts expect economic losses of $20–65 million for the two islands.\n\nDamage in the British Virgin Islands was extensive.Numerous buildings and roads were destroyed on the island of Tortola, which bore the brunt of the hurricane\'s core.Four people were confirmed dead.Along Cane Garden Bay, the storm surge submerged several seaside bars and a gas station.Satellite images revealed many of the island\'s residential zones had been left in ruins.The hurricane passed over Necker Island, also causing severe damage and destroying the mansion of Richard Branson.\n\nMost homes and businesses were destroyed on the island of Jost Van Dyke, the smallest of the B.V.I.\'s four main islands.The Governor, Gus Jaspert, who had only been sworn into office 13 days previously, declared a state of emergency - the first time this has ever happened in the Territory.After the storm, restoration of electricity took approximately 5 months.\n\nIrma\'s effects in the U.S. Virgin Islands were most profound on Saint Thomas, where at least of rain fell, and on Saint John.Saint Thomas island suffered widespread structural damage, including to its police station and airport.Patients from the fourth and third floors of Charlotte Amalie\'s hospital had to be relocated to lower floors due to flooding from roof leaks.Three deaths were attributed to Irma on the island.On nearby Saint Croix, there were communication issues and some damage to the infrastructure.Saint John lost access to ferry and cargo services, along with access to the local airport.Due to its normal reliance on electricity from Saint Thomas, the island was left without power.Total damage from the three islands was at least $1.1 billion.\n\nThe hurricane passed north of Puerto Rico, but still caused significant damage to the United States territory.Along the coast, a tide gauge observed waves up to mean higher high water.Much of the main island experienced sustained tropical storm force winds, with a peak sustained wind speed of at a weather station along San Juan Bay, while the same site observed a peak wind gust of .However, on the island of Culebra, a wind gust of was reported.Mainly due to strong winds, approximately 1.1 million out of 1.5 million of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority\'s customers lost electricity.Portions of Puerto Rico received heavy rainfall, with a peak total of in Bayamón, causing seven rivers to reach flood stage, widespread flash flooding, and at least six landslides.\n\nThe most severely affected areas included the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques, as well as the northeastern, northern, and mountainous portions of the main island.On Culebra, the island suffered an almost complete loss of electrical and water services.At least 30 homes on the island were destroyed, while about 30 other experienced substantial damage.High winds also toppled a number of trees.The only telecommunications tower on Culebra sustained damage, cutting off outside communications for several hours.In rural Loíza, 79 homes were destroyed.Throughout Puerto Rico, 781 out of 1,600 telecommunications towers went out of commission, primarily due to power outages.At least 362,000 customers lost water services.Debris, mostly fallen trees, blocked at least 72 roads.Approximately 25% to 30% of banana, coffee, papaya, and plantain crops were damaged by strong winds, with losses to farmers estimated at $30.6 million.Approximately 1,530 homes experienced at least moderate damage, with 1,448 homes moderately damaged, 32 extensively damaged, and 50 completely destroyed.\n\nHurricane Irma was attributed to around $1 billion in damage, and the NHC attributed three fatalities to Irma in Puerto Rico, though four deaths were related to the storm.Two people died due to rainstorms ahead of the hurricane: one man died in Orocovis after falling off his ladder while repairing his roof; another man on the coast in Capitanejo died after being struck by lightning.Three nearby fishermen were burned by the same lightning strike, but survived.Two other people died during the hurricane: a woman died while being evacuated from her house in a wheelchair and fell, hitting her head; another person died in a car accident in Canóvanas.Governor Ricardo Rosselló declared the islands of Culebra and Vieques to be disaster areas.\n\nAlthough spared a direct hit, both the Dominican Republic and Haiti were affected by high winds and heavy rains.A bridge over the Dajabón River connecting the two countries was broken.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, the fishing community of Nagua sustained damage from waves that destroyed homes.55,000 soldiers were deployed to affected areas to help with the clean-up efforts.By the evening of September 7, the government had counted 2,721 damaged homes.\n\nIn Haiti, flooding one meter deep sat in residential neighborhoods in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives.Mudslides, destroyed homes, flooded crops, and infrastructure damage were reported in the northern part of the country.The total expanse of the flooding stretched from Môle-Saint-Nicolas in the west to the eastern border with the Dominican Republic.\n\nOn the evening of September 7, at 7:30 pm AST (23:30 UTC), Hurricane Irma reached the Turks and Caicos Islands.While the eye passed just south of the main islands, crossing over South Caicos and the Ambergris Cays, the most powerful winds on the northern side of the eye swept all of the islands for more than two hours.Communications infrastructure was destroyed.\n\nOn September 8, Minister of Infrastructure Goldray Ewing confirmed that damage to Providenciales was extensive, with the northwestern neighborhood of Blue Hill being ""gone"".The hospital in the capital, Cockburn Town, was heavily damaged.On South Caicos, 75% of roofs were lost.Total damage was estimated at over $500 million.\n\nIn the Bahamas, the eye of the storm passed over Duncan Town, the major settlement of the Ragged Islands chain, on September 8.It also passed ""almost directly over"" Inagua and South Acklins, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.\n\nDamages were largely confined to the southern islands starting the morning of September 8.On Mayaguana and Great Inagua, downed power lines knocked out communications.On Great Inagua, 70% of homes sustained roof damage, and the island\'s school lost its roof entirely.The Morton Salt Company\'s signature production facility, one of the major employers in the country, experienced millions of dollars in damages.The Acklins settlement of Salina Point was cut off from the rest of the island by flooding, while Crooked Island had widespread roof damage.In the northern Bahamas, the worst property damage came on September 10 as the outer bands of the system produced tornadic activity on Grand Bahama and Bimini.Damage and losses across The Bahamas amounted to $135 million.\n\nWhile Irma was making landfall in Florida, the ocean was drawn away from some western shorelines of the Bahamas due to strong easterly winds.\n\nEarly on September 9, Irma made landfall on the Camagüey Archipelago off the northern coast of Cuba, with sustained winds of .The strongest official sustained wind speed was , while the highest wind gust reached ; both were observed near Camila in Ciego de Ávila Province.The weather station at Esmeralda, Camagüey, was damaged, with the wind gauge destroyed.The north coast of Cuba experienced significant coastal flooding due to storm surge and abnormally high tides generated by the storm.Wave heights at Cayo Romano exceeded .Storm surge penetrated as far as inland in some areas of Villa Clara Province.Multiple locations on the island observed at least of rainfall, with a peak total of of precipitation at Topes de Collantes.\n\nA total of 158,554 homes experienced some degree of damage, of which 14,657 were destroyed; approximately 1.9 million people experienced the direct effects of Irma.The storm partially deroofed 103,691 homes, while 23,560 were completely deroofed.Irma damaged or destroyed 980 health facilities and 2,264 schools.Approximately 3.1 million people experienced disruptions to the water supply, while 246,707 people lost telephone service.About of roads were damaged.Crops also suffered extensively, with nearly affected by the storm.Throughout the country, the hurricane inflicted $13.185 billion in damage and killed 10 people, making Irma the costliest tropical cyclone in Cuban history.\n\nThe tourist areas of Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and Cayo Santa María and the nearby town of Caibarién received the brunt of the storm, with waves rolling through town and the characteristic one-story homes completely flooded.The storm most severely Ciego de Ávila and Villa Clara provinces.Flooding worsened as the hurricane moved west, pushing the storm surge along to the regions around Havana.By the afternoon, limited flooding was occurring in Havana, including around the Malecón.Portions of province coastal flooding surpassing that which was experienced during the Storm of the Century in 1993 and Hurricane Wilma in 2005.In the city of Santa Clara, 39 buildings collapsed.Rainfall resulted in several rivers reaching major flood stage.The town of Cabaiguán in Sancti Spíritus Province in particular suffered extensive inland flooding after the Zaza River swelled.\n\nHurricane Irma directly affected a major colony of American flamingos on Cuba\'s northern Cayo Coco.Early reports from Diario de Cuba indicated that several hundred flamingos had been killed by the storm, though other estimates ranged as high as several thousand birds.\n\nHurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida.Except for the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned.Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba, but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys.The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States.After surveying the aftermath of Irma, Florida governor Rick Scott said ""I thought we would see more damage""[on the mainland] but said ""he witnessed devastation in the Keys"".President Donald Trump commented on Twitter that the devastation in some places was ""far greater than anyone thought"".\n\nDamage in the United States was estimated at a minimum of $50 billion.At the time, Irma was the fourth costliest tropical cyclone in the United States, behind hurricanes Sandy in 2012, Harvey earlier that year, and Katrina in 2005.However, later in September 2017, Hurricane Maria became the third costliest United States tropical cyclone, causing Irma to fall to the fifth costliest.At least 92 people, 10 directly and 82 indirectly, died throughout the United States in relation to Irma: 84 in Florida, 3 in Georgia, 3 in South Carolina, and 2 in North Carolina.\n\nIrma struck the state less than two weeks after Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten had caused the worst flooding seen in western Florida in 20 years, which further worsened the impacts in the region.The storm\'s large wind field resulted in strong winds across much of Florida, except for the western Panhandle.The highest reported sustained wind speed was on Marco Island, while the strongest observed wind gust was , recorded near Naples, though wind gusts of likely occurred in the Middle Florida Keys.More than 7.7 million homes and businesses in Florida were left without electricity at some point – approximately 73% of state.Generally heavy amounts of rainfall were recorded to the east of the Irma\'s path, including a peak total of in Fort Pierce.Heavy precipitation – and storm surge, in some instances – overflowed at least 32 rivers and creeks, causing significant flooding, particularly along the St. Johns River and its tributaries.Many homes and businesses suffered damage or destruction, with more than 65,000 structures damaged to some degree in West Central and Southwest Florida alone.Agriculture experienced about $2.5 billion in damage.It was estimated that the cyclone caused at least $50 billion in damage, making Irma the costliest hurricane in Florida history, surpassing Hurricane Andrew, until it was itself surpassed by Hurricane Ian, 5 years later.\n\nThroughout Florida, at least 84 people died in storm-related incidents.About half of the deaths occurred from drowning, trauma, and carbon monoxide poisoning.Broward County had 21 fatalities, the most of any county in Florida.Among those deaths were 12 people at The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, a Hollywood nursing home.The patients died from sweltering heat worsened by the lack of air conditioning.The hurricane also left at least 14 deaths in Monroe County; 6 deaths in Orange County; 5 deaths each in Duval, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties; 4 deaths in both Highlands and Hillsborough counties; 3 deaths in both Marion and Polk counties; 2 deaths each in Collier, Hardee, Leon, Pinellas, St. Lucie, and Taylor counties; and 1 death in Hendry, Lake, Lee, Liberty, Manatee, Nassau, Okeechobee, Pasco, Seminole, St. Johns, and Volusia counties.\n\nWith Irma making landfall in Monroe County as a Category 4 hurricane, the Florida Keys were hardest hit area in the state.Strong winds and storm surge flooding caused major damage to buildings, trailer parks, boats, roads, the electricity supply, mobile phone coverage, internet access, sanitation, the water supply and the fuel supply throughout the island chain.An estimated storm surge occurred at Cudjoe Key, where Irma made landfall.Throughout the island, 625 homes sustained minor damage, 52 sustained major damage, and 81 were demolished.On Big Pine Key, one of the most devastated islands, 633 homes received minor impact, 299 homes received major impact, and 473 homes were completely destroyed.Overall in Monroe County, 27,649 homes experienced some degree of damage, including 1,179 homes being destroyed, 2,977 homes receiving major damage, and 5,361 suffering minor damage.\n\nAfter devastating the Keys, the storm then struck Collier County as a Category 3 hurricane.Several communities in the county suffered extensive damage, especially along the coast.Throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, 65 homes, including 44 mobile homes, were demolished, while 1,008 homes received major damage.Property damages in unincorporated areas alone reach about $320 million.Lee County was lashed by strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused prolonged flooding in some areas.More than 24,000 homes suffered some degree of damage, with almost 3,000 homes receiving major damage and 89 homes being destroyed.Damage in the county totaled about $857 million.\n\nImpact in much of the Miami metropolitan area was generally limited to extensive tree and fence damage, as well as widespread power outages.However, in Miami-Dade County, about 1,000 homes received major damage and about 50% of crops were lost.Storm surge caused coastal flooding from Homestead to Downtown Miami, as well as in portions of Miami Beach.Parts of the Florida Heartland were devastated by high winds and flooding, particularly Hendry and Highlands counties.In the former, which has most citrus trees of any county in Florida, about 60% of orange crops were lost.Throughout Hendry County, a total of 451 homes had minor damage, 131 homes suffered major damage, and 42 others were destroyed.In Highlands County, 13,138 businesses and homes were damaged to some degree, with 144 being destroyed, 963 sustaining major damage, and 2,408 receiving minor damage.In Orange County, wind gusts reached 79 mph at Orlando International Airport.A wind gust of 91 mph was also recorded in Orlando at the top of the Disney Contemporary Resort.Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central Florida left some wind damage and flooding, necessitating evacuations and rescues, including more than 200 people in Orlo Vista after hundreds of homes were flooded.A total of 2,999 business or homes were damaged in Lake County, 7,430 in Seminole County, and 3,457 in Volusia County.Additionally, eight tornadoes touched down in Brevard County, all of which caused damage.\n\nAlong much of the Gulf Coast of Florida, to the north of where Irma made landfall, negative storm surges were observed, with water retracting rather than pushing inland, causing little coastal flooding.However, on the opposite coast, extensive erosion and storm surge flooding occurred in the First Coast, especially in Duval and St. Johns counties.In Duval County, the St. Johns River crested at heights that exceeded records set during Hurricane Dora in 1964.Portions of Jacksonville experienced flooding, particularly the downtown area and the Riverside and San Marco neighborhoods, with about 350 people rescued in those sections of the city.Water reached about high in some homes.The city of Jacksonville suffered about $85 million in damage.\n\nIn St. Johns County, storm surge left extensive damage to oceanfront properties in Ponte Vedra Beach and Vilano Beach, with several becoming uninhabitable.Additionally, some riverfront businesses in St. Augustine\'s historic district were flooded due to storm surge from the Matanzas River.In nearby Clay County, rainfall and storm surge combined to cause extensive flooding along portions of the Black Creek and the St. Johns River, with record high crests at several locations along the former.About 350 people and 75 animals were rescued from floodwaters throughout the county.A total of 275 homes were destroyed, 175 were inflicted major damage, and 124 received minor damage.\n\nThree deaths were reported in Georgia due to falling trees and debris, along with widespread wind damage and power outages throughout the state primarily due to fallen trees.On Tybee Island, as well as St. Simons Island the storm surge caused extensive flooding.The tropical storm also did $54 million in damage in the state.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the third highest storm surge on record was recorded, reaching a height of approximately .By of September 12, almost 100,000 had lost power in Upstate South Carolina.Five people died in storm-related incidents across South Carolina, all from indirect incidents.The tropical storm caused damages totaling $500,000 in the state.\n\nLight damage occurred in other areas, including Tennessee.About 75,000 customers in North Carolina lost power due to Irma.It also caused $600,000 in damages in Alabama.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Irma\'s path through the West Indies and Caribbean, the devastation to roads, harbors and airports significantly impeded the transportation and distribution of relief supplies.Foreign countries moved to provide much of the initial aid.The British, Dutch, French, and United States governments sent warships and planes with supplies and manpower to the region.International leaders, including Dutch King Willem-Alexander and French President Emmanuel Macron, quickly moved to visit affected territories.\n\nSome of the affected countries and territories also offered assistance to each other.Cuba, which sustained extensive damage from the storm, sent 750 health workers to Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, Dominica, and Haiti.Government officials and members of the public in Puerto Rico delivered assistance and evacuated people stranded on other islands.The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services granted special 30-day humanitarian visas for British Virgin Islanders to stay in Puerto Rico.Hundreds of people stranded on Saint Martin were flown to the Dominican Republic on humanitarian grounds.\n\nIn response to Hurricane Jose\'s approach, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a mandatory evacuation on September 9 for any remaining residents on Barbuda.A Miami cargo plane landed on Antigua later that day, carrying over 60 tons (120,000 lbs) of relief supplies for the displaced storm victims—including bottled water, canned food and power generators.\n\nRFA Mounts Bay stationed itself near Anguilla and provided support and relief work to the island with its helicopters and 40 marines and army engineers.The ship delivered 6 tonnes of emergency aid to Anguilla and army engineers repaired a fuel leak at Anguilla\'s main petrol dump, restored power to the island\'s hospital and provided shelters for those left homeless by the hurricane.The ship arrived in the British Virgin Islands on September 8, 2017, to provide emergency relief to the islands, including providing shelters, food and water.HMS Ocean was diverted from the Mediterranean to provide relief from Gibraltar to the affected British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos on September 7, and aid was also supplied by the Department for International Development from their disaster response centre at Kemble Airfield.As part of a £32 million operation named Operation Ruman, nearly 500 UK military personnel with emergency relief were dispatched from RAF Brize Norton.This included the first deployment of No. 38 Expeditionary Air Wing with 3 RAF aircraft; 2 Airbus A400M Atlas and 1 C130J hercules to support relief efforts.\n\nThe British government also drafted 2 members of the UK police calibre into the region on September 10, and 53 police officers were drafted from RAF Brize Norton to the affected British Overseas Territories on September 15 to help maintain order.UK politicians, including the chairs of the foreign affairs and development select committees, criticized both the government\'s preparations for the storm and its response as inadequate.\n\nBy September 12, the Department for International Development had delivered more than 40 tonnes of aid into the region, including into Turks and Caicos, and 1,000 UK military troops were deployed in the region as part of relief efforts.The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, pledged an additional £25 million worth of funding as part of relief efforts in the region on September 13, 2017, and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Boris Johnson, said that a further 250 UK military personnel would be deployed into the area within the next few days.Anguilla\'s Chief Minister, Victor Banks, praised the British government\'s response to the storm and said that Boris Johnson\'s visit to the island ""sends a very positive signal to Anguillans that the British are serious about their response to this very severe hurricane"", but went on to say that the current financial commitment from the UK was not substantial enough.\n\nBy September 15, the United Kingdom had over 70 military personnel and 4 police officers in Anguilla and had delivered 15 tonnes of aid to the island.In the British Virgin Islands, Royal Marines had cleared the airfield so that it was operational for the delivery of aid into the islands, with more than 200 British military personnel and 54 UK police officers on the ground and 8 tonnes of aid delivered to the islands.120 British military personnel were on the ground in Turks and Caicos, and over 150 shelter kits and 720 liters of water were delivered to the islands on September 15.\n\nAmendments to international aid rules by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (or OECD) allowed for the UK government to provide access to £13 billion worth of aid to the affected British Overseas Territories, through the UK\'s Official Development Assistance (ODA) by November 2017.\n\nBy the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage.The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by Irma\'s eye, remained largely inaccessible for days.Assessments showed that 15% of the national telecommunications network had been affected, with at least one tower destroyed.Bahamasair resumed a limited domestic schedule on September 10, with international flights still cancelled due to existing and anticipated destruction at other destinations.\n\nThe worst devastation occurred on Ragged Island, over which Irma\'s eye had directly passed.After days of the National Emergency Management Agency not being able to physically reach the island, officials were finally able to inspect it; they promptly declared it uninhabitable.Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said that it was the worst disaster area he or his officials had ever seen, and that all remaining residents would need to leave, potentially permanently.Business leaders and other officials called for a new long-term development model to shift the population away from such sparsely-settled islands.\n\nOn Grand Bahama and Bimini, where tornadoes associated with Irma touched down on September 10, more than 100 people were left displaced.Infrastructure damage included docks, parks, and the power system.\n\nAside from tangible asset losses, Irma brought significant economic damages.International freight shipping was projected to be offline for a week, and costs for rebuilding supplies were inflated due to demand in the U.S.\n\nSwollen rivers contributed to worsening flooding in the days after the storm system left, resulting in additional evacuations.Officials resorted to using inflatable rafts to access affected areas.The national electrical infrastructure was said to be extensively damaged.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, flooding worsened following Irma\'s departure, leading the number of displaced persons to increase to more than 24,000 by September 8.President Danilo Medina ordered further evacuations due to at-risk dams, while the government banned swimming in rivers and ordered boats kept in port.More than 422,000 people were left without water due to 28 aqueducts being damaged.\n\nIn Haiti, officials stated that losses were greater than they could have been since people largely did not heed early preparation and evacuation warnings.At least 5,000 homes were flooded.One man died trying to cross a flooded river; another went missing and 17 were injured.The trash- and waste-contaminated floodwaters in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives led to fears of cholera outbreaks.Flooding continued to worsen days after the storm, as runoff from the mountains swelled rivers in low-lying farming communities.United Nations peacekeepers from Brazil were able to gain access to the flooded northwest region to provide urgent aid, but non-governmental organizations and Haitian economists warned that the estimated 30,000 victims would need longer-term assistance as well.Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant appointed a government commission to address Irma\'s effects, with Action Against Hunger in charge of humanitarian coordination.\n\nIn the USVI, residents and tourists alike were described as being in a state of traumatic shock.By September 7, the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship had arrived in the USVI to provide supplies, damage assessment, and evacuation assistance.Four additional warships, some of which had already been on their way to Texas to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief, were redirected to the region.At a September 10 news conference, Governor Kenneth Mapp described Irma as a ""horrific disaster"" for which ""[t]here will be no restorations or solutions in days or weeks.""The Federal Emergency Management Agency airlifted in goods for residents, who were subjected to a curfew.Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line agreed to transport tourists to Florida, contingent upon port availability following the state\'s own experience with Irma.\n\nOn Saint John, described as ""perhaps the site of Irma\'s worst devastation on American soil,"" it took six days for an active-theater disaster zone to be established, leading to criticism of the U.S. government response.The National Guard was delayed in reaching Saint John due to the number of overturned boats left in the harbor.The National Guard was brought in to maintain order, while the Coast Guard brought evacuees to cruise ships bound for San Juan and Miami.There was still no electricity on St. John in the middle of October 2017.\n\nBy September 9, more than one million Puerto Ricans were still without power, tens of thousands were without water, and several thousand were still in shelters.Hospitals were operating on generator power.The government was struggling to establish contact with the islands of Culebra and Vieques.By September 10, the main island had recovered enough to serve as a refuge for people stranded on other islands, including 1,200 tourists from Saint Martin and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Airlifts had brought more than 50 patients to Puerto Rico.\n\nFive months after Irma, two-thirds of the hospital beds on Saint Thomas were still unavailable, due to extensive physical damage and staffing shortages.\n\nDamage to Sint Maarten\'s harbour and to Princess Juliana International Airport left the Dutch part of Saint Martin unreachable, although the smaller Grand Case-Espérance Airport on the French side could be reopened by September 7 for supply aid by helicopter and airplane.The French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops on board a CASA/IPTN CN-235 aircraft.\n\nThe following day, the Dutch military was able to airlift dialysis patients off the island while also dropping leaflets to warn islanders about the rapidly approaching Hurricane Jose.Although the airport was closed, 435 students and faculty of the American University of the Caribbean were evacuated by the U.S. military.On September 10, Dutch King Willem-Alexander departed for the region, with intentions to visit Sint Maarten and other affected Dutch territories and commonwealth members.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron followed this announcement by stating his intentions to visit the French part of the island on September 12 in order to bring aid supplies.In response to criticism of the French handling of the disaster, 1,000 troops, police, and other emergency workers were sent to Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.\n\nOn both sides of Saint Martin, desperate conditions combined with food and water shortages in Irma\'s aftermath led to reports of violence, scavenging, and theft.In response, the French government increased its troop deployment to 2,200 and the Dutch government sent more than 600 military and police personnel.\n\nThe day after the hurricane hit Saint Barthelemy the French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops into the reopened Grand Case-Espérance Airport.On September 7 and 9, equipment and personnel were flown from France to Guadeloupe and Martinique.\n\nSporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm.\n\nOn September 11, Florida Governor Rick Scott conducted an aerial tour to survey the damage to the Keys.The Overseas Highway remained closed while authorities assessed the integrity of the 42 bridges along the route.Residents returning to the Keys were faced with a police roadblock, to the south of Florida City.USS Iwo Jima, USS New York and aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were sent to the Keys area to aid with the recovery.\n\nOn September 12, some residents were allowed to return into the Keys as far as Islamorada.Although road damage blocked entry any farther than Islamorada, bridges had been inspected and found safe to Sugarloaf Key.By late on September 12, the Overseas Highway had been repaired and the bridges inspected as safe for first responders to travel to Key West.On September 16, residents were free to return to Marathon.Residents were allowed to return to Key West the following day, although the Keys remained closed to tourists and a checkpoint remained in place in Florida City.\n\nDue mainly to the widespread loss of power, cell phone service was also reduced after battery backup power for cell phone towers ran out and backup generators ran out of fuel.In an impact report by the FCC, as of 11 AM EDT on September 12, 89 of 108 (82%) cell phone towers were non-functioning in Monroe County (Florida Keys), 154 of 212 (73%) were non-functioning in Collier County (Naples), 36 of 46 (78%) were non-functioning in Hendry County, and an additional six counties had 41-60% of cell phone towers not functioning, including Lee County (Fort Myers) and Miami-Dade County.\n\nNOAA released map-format aerial reconnaissance image data of damage from the storm.The imagery featured several areas of Florida: including the Florida Keys, the southwest coast of Florida from Marco Island to Punta Gorda, much of the northeast coast of Florida, and portions of the Jacksonville area.Portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts were also photographed.Additionally, the Sun-Sentinel published before and after photos of several landmarks in the Florida Keys.\n\nIn the days after the hurricane, due to the heavy rainfall, numerous rivers had flooded, including residential areas.Public health risks, such as diarrheal infections and mosquito-borne illnesses, remain from the flooding that resulted in the aftermath of the hurricane.A large concern from flooding is contamination because people become exposed to dirty floodwaters and the potential for contaminated water to enter the local water supply is significant.One example of an illness that can enter the water supply is leptospirosis, which is rat urine carries into the floodwaters.Untreated exposure to leptospirosis can cause kidney damage, meningitis, and liver failure.Noroviruses and other infections are also a risk.\n\nFollowing Irma\'s passage, a hand-carved wooden canoe was discovered on the banks of the Indian River and could be several hundred years old.The state has removed the canoe for examination and safe keeping.\n\nDue to Irma\'s and Hurricane Harvey\'s impact in Florida and Texas, U.S. employment declined in September 2017 for the first time since September 2010.The leisure and hospitality industries were especially hard hit, losing 111,000 jobs in September.\n\nIrma set multiple records for intensity, especially at easterly longitudes, time spent at such an intensity, and its intensity at landfall.When Irma reached Category 5 intensity with winds of at 11:45 UTC on September 5 at 57.7°W, it became the easternmost Atlantic hurricane of this strength on record, surpassing Hurricane David of 1979, later beaten by Hurricane Lorenzo 2 years later.By 00:15 UTC on September 6, Irma reached peak intensity with () winds and a minimum pressure of .This ties it with Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and Hurricane Rita of 2005 as the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed.Only five other Atlantic hurricanes have been recorded with wind speeds higher than Irma: Hurricane Allen of 1980, which had maximum sustained winds of , and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Gilbert of 1988, Hurricane Wilma of 2005, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, all of which had peak winds of .At the time, Irma was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; later surpassed by Hurricane Dorian, and was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007.In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category 5 strength winds, and the third-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, with a value of 64.9 units.Only the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane and Hurricane Ivan in 2004 achieved higher values.\n\nOn September 6, Irma made landfall on the islands of Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Virgin Gorda at peak strength.This ties Irma with cyclones Monica of 2006 and Winston of 2016, and typhoons Zeb of 1998 and Megi of 2010 as the seventh-strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall globally – in terms of sustained winds – trailing only Typhoon Goni of 2020 which bore winds of at landfall, Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 and Typhoon Meranti of 2016, which bore winds of at landfall, and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Typhoon Joan of 1959, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, which bore winds of at landfall.Irma is second to the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin, and is the first hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic at Category 5 status since Felix in 2007.Irma is the first recorded Category 5 hurricane to affect the northern Leeward Islands, and was one of the worst storms to hit the region on record, along with Hurricane Donna in 1960 and Hurricane Luis in 1995.In addition, Irma is only the second hurricane on record to make landfall in Cuba at Category 5 intensity, with the other being a hurricane in 1924.Furthermore, when Irma made landfall on Barbuda, Saint Martin, Virgin Gorda, and Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane, it became one of only two recorded Atlantic storms to make landfall in multiple nations at this strength; the other was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which struck both Eleuthera and the United States as a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nIrma made landfall in the Florida Keys with winds of and a pressure of , making it the strongest hurricane to strike Florida in terms of wind speed since Charley in 2004, and the most intense to strike the state in terms of barometric pressure since Andrew in 1992.In the span of two weeks, two Category 4 hurricanes—Harvey and Irma—struck the continental United States, the first time on record two Atlantic tropical cyclones of such strength made landfall on the country in the same hurricane season.This also marked only the third occurrence of two consecutive Atlantic storms making landfall in the United States as major hurricanes.The other two instances were the Great Charleston and Cheniere Caminada hurricanes in 1893, and hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne in 2004.\n\nBecause of the extensive damage and loss of life the hurricane caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Irma from its rotating naming lists in April 2018, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane.It was replaced with Idalia for the 2023 season.\n\nWeather of 2017 Tropical cyclones in 2017 List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes Operation RUMAN – UK military-civil disaster relief response to Hurricane Irma.List of Cuba hurricanes List

'Claim_Context': 'Hurricane Irma was an extremely powerful Cape Verde hurricane that caused widespread destruction across its path in early September 2017. Irma was the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the Leeward Islands on record, followed by Maria two weeks later. At the time, it was considered the most powerful hurricane on record in the open Atlantic region, outside of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, until it was surpassed by Hurricane Dorian two years later. It was also the third-strongest Atlantic hurricane at landfall ever recorded, just behind the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane and Dorian. The ninth named storm, fourth hurricane, second major hurricane, and first Category 5 hurricane of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Irma caused widespread and catastrophic damage throughout its long lifetime, particularly in the northeastern Caribbean and the Florida Keys. It was also the most intense hurricane to strike the continental United States since Katrina in 2005, the first major hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Wilma in the same year, and the first Category 4 hurricane to strike the state since Charley in 2004.

one in Barbados; three in Barbuda; four in the British Virgin Islands; 10 in Cuba; 11 in the French West Indies; one in Haiti; three in Puerto Rico; four on the Dutch side of Sint Maarten; 92 in the contiguous United States, and four in the U.S. Virgin Islands.Hurricane Irma was the top Google searched term in the U.S. and globally in 2017.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa on August 26.The tropical wave moved off the coast of the continent late on August 27.Throughout the next two days, showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low-pressure area, as the system passed just south of and then through the Cape Verde Islands on August 29.Around 00:00 UTC on the following day, the system developed into a tropical depression just west of the Cape Verde Islands.Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Irma, based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates.With warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, strengthening was anticipated, with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier air.\n\nThe nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow, as an anticyclone became established over the system, with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images.Early on August 31, shortly after the development of a central dense overcast (CDO) and an eye feature, Irma underwent rapid intensification, becoming a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 UTC and then a Category 3 hurricane, becoming a major hurricane – around 00:00 UTC on September 1.Within a 48-hour period, the hurricane\'s intensity had increased by .On September 2, a ship passed to the west of the center of Irma, recording maximum winds of , which indicated that the eye of Irma remained compact.A strong high pressure system to the north of Irma caused the storm to move west-southwestward between September 2 and September 4.The first aircraft reconnaissance mission departed from Barbados on the afternoon of September 3, discovering an eye in diameter and surface winds of .\n\nOn September 4, after moving into more favorable conditions, Irma strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane.As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by 12:00 UTC on the following day, with winds of .The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at near 18:00 UTC on September 5. Irma acquired annular characteristics around this time, with the storm exhibiting a large, symmetric CDO and an impressive satellite appearance.Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern Leeward Islands.Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of Barbuda at peak intensity, with the storm\'s central minimum pressure having bottomed out at – this was the lowest in the Atlantic since Dean in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of .Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15 UTC on Sint Maarten, and at 16:30 UTC on Virgin Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands, though the storm\'s central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall.\n\nAs the hurricane moved away from the Virgin Islands late on September 6, observations from reconnaissance flights, as well as Doppler radar in San Juan, Puerto Rico, indicated an elliptical eye and double eyewalls.Late on September 6, the cyclone passed about north of Puerto Rico.Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of Hispaniola throughout the day on September 7.After beginning an eyewall replacement cycle, Irma weakened to a Category 4 hurricane as it passed south of the Turks and Caicos Islands early on September 8.This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category 5 intensity, the second-longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above – behind only the 1932 Cuba hurricane.At 05:00 UTC on September 8, Irma made landfall on the island of Little Inagua in the Bahamas with sustained winds of .The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a subtropical ridge to its north.Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category 5 intensity at 18:00 UTC that day east of Cuba as deep convection became more pronounced and organized.The hurricane then made landfall in Cayo Romano, Cuba, at 03:00 UTC on September 9, with winds of .This made Irma only the second Category 5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the 1924 Cuba hurricane.As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category 2 storm later on September 9.\n\nAfter slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards Florida around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental United States.Moving over the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, Irma quickly restrengthened to a Category 4 hurricane at 06:00 UTC on September 10, as deep convection improved and the eye became better defined.In addition, Irma\'s wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of and gale-force winds spanning in diameter.The cyclone made landfall in Cudjoe Key, Florida, at 13:00 UTC on September 10, at Category 4 intensity, with winds of .Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category 3 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30 UTC, in Marco Island, Florida, with sustained winds of .Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category 3 intensity hours after landfall.Passing east of Tampa as a weakening Category 1 hurricane around 06:00 UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation – though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds.The system finally weakened to a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC that day as it entered southern Georgia, while acquiring some extratropical characteristics.At 06:00 UTC on September 12, Irma degenerated to a remnant low just as it entered Alabama, as most of the deep convection had diminished.The remnants persisted for another day or so before dissipating over Missouri on September 13.\n\nGiven that Irma\'s forecast track was along much of the Caribbean island chain, hurricane warnings were issued for the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and parts of Hispaniola on September 5.\n\nIn Antigua and Barbuda, residents safeguarded their homes and cleaned up their properties in anticipation of strong winds.Emergency crews were put on standby at public shelters and hospitals by September 5 to assist with any evacuations.Expecting a direct hit, more than half of the residents on Barbuda took shelter, and relief supplies were preemptively mobilized.The National Emergency Management Organization on Saint Lucia urged small craft operators and swimmers to be mindful of forecasts for high surf.Small Craft Warnings and High Surf Advisories were hoisted for Dominica, where residents were urged to remain vigilant of the potential for high waves, landslides, and flooding.\n\nIn Guadeloupe, low-lying and cliff-edge homes were evacuated at the threat of flooding and erosion.Schools and public businesses closed on September 5 and 6.Hospitals stocked up on three days\' worth of supplies and checked the functionality of their generators.Of the island\'s 32 communes, 22 activated their emergency plans; 1,500 people were urged to take shelter.The island sustained relatively minor damage and became the base for relief efforts on Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.Though the core of the hurricane was expected to remain north of the island, a yellow alert was issued for Martinique due to the likelihood of rough seas.The island dispatched relief supplies and military reinforcements to its neighboring islands of Guadeloupe, Saint Martin.and Saint Barthélemy, which faced a greater risk of a direct impact.\n\nOn September 4, Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency.By September 6, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency had deployed response teams in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.Supplies, including food rations, medical supplies, and blankets, were pre-staged in strategic locations on the islands for distribution.\n\nOn September 5, the Dominican Republic activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage; the United States and Haiti followed suit two days later.According to officials, 11,200 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas prior to the storm\'s arrival.Approximately 7,400 tourists were moved to Santo Domingo, away from beach resorts.In Haiti, government officials and aid organizations struggled with early preparation and evacuation efforts.While some officials blamed reluctance and indifference on the part of the population, others ""admitted they were not prepared for the onslaught and no mandatory evacuation orders were in place ahead of Irma\'s approach.""Local officials contended that they had not received promised funds, supplies, or equipment from the national government.The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti prepared its 1,000 peacekeepers and engineers to assist.\n\nIn the Turks and Caicos, evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas starting September 5. Schools were closed, government buildings were boarded up, and shelters were opened.Officials spread warnings to residents in English, Creole, and Spanish via social media, radio, SMS text, and WhatsApp.In The Bahamas, the government began preparations the week prior to the hurricane\'s arrival, including securing national sports facilities to use as shelters.By September 7, the government had evacuated 1,609 people by air from the southern islands, including 365 from Bimini.Controlled cutting of the power supply to southern and central Bahamian islands was conducted in advance of the storm.Shelters were made available, though usage was low due to most evacuees staying with family on other islands.Of the 2,679 foreign tourists still in The Bahamas on September 7, about 1,200 were being housed at Atlantis Paradise Island, one of the most hurricane-ready structures in the country.\n\nIn Cuba, meteorologists did not initially predict a direct hit.Fuel conservation was enacted in Camagüey Province to ensure that enough would be available during post-storm power outages.The Civil Defense evacuated nearly one million people from low-lying areas, including thousands of Canadian and European tourists in the Jardines del Rey.Dolphins at a Cayo Guillermo resort were evacuated by helicopter.\n\nThe NHC issued several watches and warnings for the Southeastern United States.The first watches and warnings were issued at 15:00 UTC on September 7, which was a hurricane watch from the Jupiter Inlet to Bonita Beach, including the Florida Keys and Lake Okeechobee.The watches and warnings were extended into Georgia and South Carolina on September 9.At 21:00 UTC on that day, the advisories reached their maximum extent, with a hurricane warning covering the entire east coast of the state, the west coast from Indian Pass southward, and the Florida Keys; a hurricane watch was in place from the Florida–Georgia state line to Edisto Beach, South Carolina; and there were two tropical storm warnings, one in Florida from Indian Pass to the Okaloosa–Walton county line and the other from the Florida–Georgia state line to the South Santee River in South Carolina.Watches and warnings were gradually discontinued as Irma moved inland and weakened, with all of them canceled by early on September 12.\n\nOn September 4, Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency.Governor Scott placed 100 members of the Florida National Guard on duty to assist in preparations.All 7,000 troops were ordered to be on duty by September 8.Officials advised residents to stock their hurricane kits.The state coordinated with electrical companies in order for power outages to be restored as quickly as possible, extending resources such as equipment, fuel, and lodging for the approximately 24,000 restoration personnel who had been activated.Governor Scott suspended tolls on all toll roads in Florida, including the turnpike.All state offices in Florida were closed from September 8 to September 11, while public schools, state colleges, and state universities in all 67 counties were closed during the same period.The Florida Department of Education coordinated with school districts as the need for transportation by school buses and opening shelters arose.By September 9, more than 150 state parks were closed.Throughout the state, almost 700 emergency shelters were opened.The shelters collectively housed about 191,764 people, with more than 40% of them staying in a shelter in South Florida.Additionally, more than 60 special needs shelters were opened, which housed more than 5,000 people by September 9.\n\nMany airports across the state, particularly in Central and South Florida, were closed.Nearly 9,000 flights intending to arrive in or depart from Florida were canceled.Along Florida\'s coasts, most seaports were closed or opened with restricted access.For the fifth time in its 45-year history, the Walt Disney World Resort was completely closed due to the storm.Its theme parks, water parks, and Disney Springs were all closed by 9:00 p.m. on September 9 and remained closed until September 12.Other Orlando-area theme parks, including Universal Orlando Resort and SeaWorld Orlando, were also closed.The Kennedy Space Center was closed from September 8 to September 15.\n\nAn estimated 6.5 million Floridians were ordered to evacuate, mostly those living on barrier islands or in coastal areas; in mobile or sub-standard homes; and in low-lying or flood prone areas.Mandatory evacuations were ordered for portions of Brevard, Broward, Citrus, Collier, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Glades, Hendry, Hernando, Indian River, Lee, Martin, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Lucie, Sumter, and Volusia counties.All of Monroe County, where the Florida Keys are located, was placed under a mandatory evacuation.Residents in communities near the southern half of Lake Okeechobee were also ordered to leave.Additionally, voluntary evacuation notices were issued for all or parts of Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Charlotte, Columbia, Desoto, Hardee, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lake, Manatee, Okeechobee, Osceola, and Polk counties.\n\nA record 6.5 million Floridians evacuated, making it the largest evacuation in the state\'s history.Evacuees caused significant traffic congestion on northbound Interstate 95, Interstate 75, and Florida\'s Turnpike, exacerbated by the fact that the entire Florida peninsula was within the cone of uncertainty in the NHC\'s forecast path in the days before the storm, so evacuees from both coasts headed north, as evacuees would not be safer by fleeing to the opposite coast.Fuel was in short supply throughout peninsular Florida during the week before Irma\'s arrival, especially along evacuation routes, leading to hours-long lines at fuel stations and even escorts of fuel trucks by the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nUse of the left shoulder as a lane for moving traffic was allowed on northbound Interstate 75 from Wildwood to the Georgia state line beginning September 8 and on eastbound Interstate 4 from Tampa to State Road 429 near Celebration for a few hours on September 9.It was the first time that the shoulder-use plan, which was introduced at the start of the 2017 hurricane season, was implemented by the state for hurricane evacuations.The shoulder-use plan was implemented in place of labor- and resource-intensive contraflow lane reversal, in which both sides of an interstate highway are used for one direction of traffic.\n\nOfficials from the Environmental Protection Agency, which had been criticized for its response to Hurricane Harvey, took special measures to inspect and secure hazardous materials, especially at Superfund sites.Direct Relief, a disaster relief organization, coordinated with local health centers and provided resources to help facilities on the front lines of Floridian and Puerto Rican communities.\n\nGeorgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency initially for all six coastal counties on September 6, but eventually expanded the declaration to 94 counties south of Atlanta metropolitan area, and then the entire state on September 10.Atlanta was placed under its first-ever tropical storm warning.Governor Deal ordered mandatory evacuations for all areas east of Interstate 95 on September 7, before extending the order to the entirety of Chatham County and low-lying areas west of I-95 on the following day.In total, 540,000 people on the Georgia coast were ordered to leave.Contraflow lane reversal for Interstate 16 took effect on the morning of September 9 from Savannah to Dublin, Georgia.All Georgia state parks were open for free to evacuees, as was the 800-acre camping area at Atlanta Motor Speedway.Reversible HOT lanes on Interstate 75 in Georgia through south metro Atlanta were open 24 hours northbound with no tolls.\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on September 6, with South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster following suit the same day.Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency on September 8 in order to protect Virginia residents and to mobilize resources in support of neighboring states.Officials in New Orleans stated that there would not be much time for preparations if Irma failed to make the projected northward turn, but that South Texas or Florida would not be a good evacuation destination.On September 10, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam issued an executive order allowing medical professionals in other states to practice in Tennessee to aid Hurricane Irma evacuees.This order also allowed pharmacies to give out 14-day supplies of medicine, and gave women and children from outside the state the ability to participate in the Tennessee Department of Health programs.Bristol Motor Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway, and Charlotte Motor Speedway all opened their campgrounds to evacuees free of charge.\n\nIn professional sports, the Miami Dolphins–Tampa Bay Buccaneers game scheduled for September 10 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was postponed to November 19 due to the storm\'s threat.The Dolphins left early for their road game against the Los Angeles Chargers.The Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees moved their September 11–13 series from Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg to Citi Field in Queens.Minor League Baseball\'s Florida State League, Carolina League, and Southern League called off their championship finals and as a result, named their division series winners league co-champions.The Miami FC versus San Francisco Deltas match on September 10 was cancelled so the players and staff could prepare for the storm with their families.The Orlando Pride of the National Women\'s Soccer League rescheduled their September 9 match to September 7. Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer did not have any scheduled home games in September, but was unable to return to training facilities in Orlando due to Hurricane Irma.\n\nIn college football, the UCF Knights-Memphis Tigers game scheduled for September 9 was moved to September 30, replacing UCF\'s game against Maine and Memphis game against Georgia State.UCF also cancelled their game against Georgia Tech on September 16, as UCF\'s stadium hosted the National Guard.The USF Bulls-Connecticut Huskies football game was also cancelled.The Miami Hurricanes–Arkansas State Redwolves game scheduled for September 9 at Centennial Bank Stadium in Arkansas was canceled due to travel concerns for the University of Miami.The Florida Gators-Northern Colorado Bears match in Gainesville scheduled for September 9 was cancelled.The Florida State Seminoles contest against the Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks was canceled on September 8.The Seminoles\' rivalry game with the Hurricanes in Tallahassee, originally scheduled for September 16, was postponed tp October 7.The FIU Panthers game against the Alcorn State Braves was moved up a day and relocated to Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.The Georgia Southern Eagles game against the New Hampshire Wildcats on September 9 was also moved to Legion Field for that day.\n\nAs of September 5, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding was running dangerously low, due to its response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas the previous week, prompting the Trump administration to request an immediate $8 billion in additional funding as Irma approached Florida.Given the rate that current funds are being consumed and the catastrophic damage, the United States Senate almost doubled the requested amount to $15.3 billion, with the understanding that this would only be about 10% of what will be required for responding to Harvey.\n\nHurricane Irma\'s path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating, with landfalls in Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Martin, the Bahamas, Cuba, and the United States, all at major hurricane intensity.Furthermore, the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences.Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria.\n\nThe eyewall of the hurricane moved over Barbuda near its record peak intensity early on September 6; a weather station observed a wind gust of .The same station also recorded a minimum barometric pressure of .The exact state of the island remained unclear for hours after Irma\'s passage, as downed phone lines ceased all communication with nearby islands.Later that afternoon, Prime Minister Gaston Browne surveyed the territory by helicopter, revealing an effectively uninhabitable island.Irma damaged or destroyed 95% of the structures on Barbuda, including its hospital, schools, and both of its hotels; it completely flattened some residential blocks while submerging others.The destruction rendered the island\'s sole airport and much of its infrastructure inoperative—including water and telecommunication services—which further hampered relief efforts.Property damage on Barbuda ranged from $150 million to $300 million.A total of three storm-related deaths were reported on the island.\n\nIn addition to the catastrophic impact on Barbuda\'s human residents, concern turned to the storm\'s effects on the island\'s wildlife.The island\'s only endemic bird, the near-threatened Barbuda warbler, numbered less than 2,000 individuals prior to the hurricane.For some time it was unknown if the warbler survived the hurricane or its aftermath; however within a few months it was confirmed that not only did the species survive, but the most of the birds survived the storm.Barbuda\'s Codrington Lagoon, home to the largest colony of magnificent frigatebirds in the Caribbean, with an estimated 2,500 nesting pairs, was also inundated by the storm surge.\n\nRemaining just outside of Irma\'s strongest windfield, Antigua sustained less severe damage, in the form of leveled roofs and fences, downed power poles and lines, and uprooted trees.Some street flooding also took place in low-lying areas.Three people were treated for minor storm-related injuries.Forensic disaster analysts from the Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM), a Germany-based risk management agency, estimate that economic losses for Antigua and Barbuda will exceed $120 million.\n\nOn the morning of September 6, Irma\'s center crossed the island of Saint Martin while the storm was at peak intensity, sweeping away entire structures, submerging roads and cars, and triggering an island-wide blackout.Irma\'s extreme winds ripped trees out of the ground and sent vehicles and debris from damaged structures scattered across the territory.On the French side of Saint-Martin, entire marinas around Marigot were left in ruins, littered with the stranded remnants of boats that had smashed into each other.A hotel caught on fire, but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze.Another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor.Media images depicted devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds had shattered their windows.Irma killed four people on the French side of the island and injured 50 others, one of whom was in critical condition.As many as 95% of the buildings there were damaged to some degree; 60% of those were totally uninhabitable.Estimates from CEDIM indicate a minimum of $950 million worth of economic losses.Total losses exceeded €3.5 billion (US$4.17 billion).\n\nA similar situation unfolded in Sint Maarten, Saint Martin\'s Dutch half, as intense winds ripped through buildings and lifted vehicles aloft ""as if they were matches"".The hurricane wreaked havoc on Princess Juliana International Airport, with ""huge chunks of the building [strewn] across the runway and a jet bridge snapped in half.""It demolished or severely damaged about 70% of Sint Maarten\'s houses, forcing thousands of residents into public shelters.There were 4 deaths and 23 injuries, 11 of which were serious, in the Dutch territory.Irma is considered the worst natural disaster to hit Sint Maarten; the extent of its damage far exceeded that of any previous hurricane.Total damages were estimated at €2.5 billion (US$2.98 billion).\n\nIrma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the French island of Saint Barthélemy, southeast of Saint Martin.Describing the extent of the destruction, one local compared it to ""a bomb that burned all vegetation,"" while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively ""erased the island from the map"".Violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments, with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation.Streets in the capital of Gustavia were turned into rushing rivers, which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture.The island\'s fire station was inundated with up to of flood waters.With scores of homes and much of the infrastructure destroyed, the majority of the island\'s population was left stranded and without water, electricity or phone service.The associated economic losses could exceed $480 million according to CEDIM\'s analysts.\n\nPreliminary assessments from the French government indicate that Hurricane Irma caused a combined €1.2 billion (US$1.43 billion) in insured losses across the French territories of Saint-Martin and Saint Barts.This total covered private property such as homes, vehicles and businesses (including lost revenue); the extent of the damage to infrastructural and public facilities remains undetermined.Nonetheless, this made Irma one of the costliest natural disasters to hit the French Republic in 50 years.\n\nOn January 30, 2018, roughly five months after Irma, an analysis was published indicating that an anemometer on the island recorded an unofficial gust to before failing.\n\nThe British Overseas Territory of Anguilla saw the eyewall of the storm pass over it on September 6.Many homes and schools were destroyed, and the island\'s only hospital was badly damaged.The devastation was particularly severe in East End, where the winds uprooted scores of trees and power poles and demolished a number of houses.In The Valley, the island\'s capital, the hurricane blew out the windows of government buildings.Rough seas inflicted heavy damage upon several bays and harbors, and a seaside restaurant was completely eradicated.About 90% of roads were left impassable.The island\'s air traffic control tower was damaged, exacerbating the already poor communication with the island.One death was reported on the island.Estimates of losses on the island total at least $190 million.\n\nLarge swells ahead of Irma washed ashore debris and sea life in Castries, Saint Lucia, blocking some roads.Seaside roads were inundated with water.One surfer was killed amid rough surf in Barbados after hitting a reef and breaking his neck.Trees were also destroyed.The hurricane\'s effects, such as violent seas and rattling trees, were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in Guadeloupe.Several houses were damaged.Around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm, leaving several communes in the dark without running water.Overall damage was limited to external parts of houses and trees that were blown onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seas.\n\nSaint Kitts and Nevis endured similar conditions to other islands.Blustery rainstorms triggered scattered power outages and disabled the island\'s water system, but per the International Red Cross, the islands were spared the level of destruction seen elsewhere.Still, Prime Minister Timothy Harris stated that property and infrastructure had sustained ""significant damage.""The Dutch territories of Saba and Sint Eustatius were also struck by the hurricane\'s winds, resulting in infrastructural damage, water shortages and telecommunication outages.Several houses were left uninhabitable.On Saba, the hurricane also defoliated trees and injured a few people.CEDIM\'s analysts expect economic losses of $20–65 million for the two islands.\n\nDamage in the British Virgin Islands was extensive.Numerous buildings and roads were destroyed on the island of Tortola, which bore the brunt of the hurricane\'s core.Four people were confirmed dead.Along Cane Garden Bay, the storm surge submerged several seaside bars and a gas station.Satellite images revealed many of the island\'s residential zones had been left in ruins.The hurricane passed over Necker Island, also causing severe damage and destroying the mansion of Richard Branson.\n\nMost homes and businesses were destroyed on the island of Jost Van Dyke, the smallest of the B.V.I.\'s four main islands.The Governor, Gus Jaspert, who had only been sworn into office 13 days previously, declared a state of emergency - the first time this has ever happened in the Territory.After the storm, restoration of electricity took approximately 5 months.\n\nIrma\'s effects in the U.S. Virgin Islands were most profound on Saint Thomas, where at least of rain fell, and on Saint John.Saint Thomas island suffered widespread structural damage, including to its police station and airport.Patients from the fourth and third floors of Charlotte Amalie\'s hospital had to be relocated to lower floors due to flooding from roof leaks.Three deaths were attributed to Irma on the island.On nearby Saint Croix, there were communication issues and some damage to the infrastructure.Saint John lost access to ferry and cargo services, along with access to the local airport.Due to its normal reliance on electricity from Saint Thomas, the island was left without power.Total damage from the three islands was at least $1.1 billion.\n\nThe hurricane passed north of Puerto Rico, but still caused significant damage to the United States territory.Along the coast, a tide gauge observed waves up to mean higher high water.Much of the main island experienced sustained tropical storm force winds, with a peak sustained wind speed of at a weather station along San Juan Bay, while the same site observed a peak wind gust of .However, on the island of Culebra, a wind gust of was reported.Mainly due to strong winds, approximately 1.1 million out of 1.5 million of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority\'s customers lost electricity.Portions of Puerto Rico received heavy rainfall, with a peak total of in Bayamón, causing seven rivers to reach flood stage, widespread flash flooding, and at least six landslides.\n\nThe most severely affected areas included the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques, as well as the northeastern, northern, and mountainous portions of the main island.On Culebra, the island suffered an almost complete loss of electrical and water services.At least 30 homes on the island were destroyed, while about 30 other experienced substantial damage.High winds also toppled a number of trees.The only telecommunications tower on Culebra sustained damage, cutting off outside communications for several hours.In rural Loíza, 79 homes were destroyed.Throughout Puerto Rico, 781 out of 1,600 telecommunications towers went out of commission, primarily due to power outages.At least 362,000 customers lost water services.Debris, mostly fallen trees, blocked at least 72 roads.Approximately 25% to 30% of banana, coffee, papaya, and plantain crops were damaged by strong winds, with losses to farmers estimated at $30.6 million.Approximately 1,530 homes experienced at least moderate damage, with 1,448 homes moderately damaged, 32 extensively damaged, and 50 completely destroyed.\n\nHurricane Irma was attributed to around $1 billion in damage, and the NHC attributed three fatalities to Irma in Puerto Rico, though four deaths were related to the storm.Two people died due to rainstorms ahead of the hurricane: one man died in Orocovis after falling off his ladder while repairing his roof; another man on the coast in Capitanejo died after being struck by lightning.Three nearby fishermen were burned by the same lightning strike, but survived.Two other people died during the hurricane: a woman died while being evacuated from her house in a wheelchair and fell, hitting her head; another person died in a car accident in Canóvanas.Governor Ricardo Rosselló declared the islands of Culebra and Vieques to be disaster areas.\n\nAlthough spared a direct hit, both the Dominican Republic and Haiti were affected by high winds and heavy rains.A bridge over the Dajabón River connecting the two countries was broken.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, the fishing community of Nagua sustained damage from waves that destroyed homes.55,000 soldiers were deployed to affected areas to help with the clean-up efforts.By the evening of September 7, the government had counted 2,721 damaged homes.\n\nIn Haiti, flooding one meter deep sat in residential neighborhoods in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives.Mudslides, destroyed homes, flooded crops, and infrastructure damage were reported in the northern part of the country.The total expanse of the flooding stretched from Môle-Saint-Nicolas in the west to the eastern border with the Dominican Republic.\n\nOn the evening of September 7, at 7:30 pm AST (23:30 UTC), Hurricane Irma reached the Turks and Caicos Islands.While the eye passed just south of the main islands, crossing over South Caicos and the Ambergris Cays, the most powerful winds on the northern side of the eye swept all of the islands for more than two hours.Communications infrastructure was destroyed.\n\nOn September 8, Minister of Infrastructure Goldray Ewing confirmed that damage to Providenciales was extensive, with the northwestern neighborhood of Blue Hill being ""gone"".The hospital in the capital, Cockburn Town, was heavily damaged.On South Caicos, 75% of roofs were lost.Total damage was estimated at over $500 million.\n\nIn the Bahamas, the eye of the storm passed over Duncan Town, the major settlement of the Ragged Islands chain, on September 8.It also passed ""almost directly over"" Inagua and South Acklins, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.\n\nDamages were largely confined to the southern islands starting the morning of September 8.On Mayaguana and Great Inagua, downed power lines knocked out communications.On Great Inagua, 70% of homes sustained roof damage, and the island\'s school lost its roof entirely.The Morton Salt Company\'s signature production facility, one of the major employers in the country, experienced millions of dollars in damages.The Acklins settlement of Salina Point was cut off from the rest of the island by flooding, while Crooked Island had widespread roof damage.In the northern Bahamas, the worst property damage came on September 10 as the outer bands of the system produced tornadic activity on Grand Bahama and Bimini.Damage and losses across The Bahamas amounted to $135 million.\n\nWhile Irma was making landfall in Florida, the ocean was drawn away from some western shorelines of the Bahamas due to strong easterly winds.\n\nEarly on September 9, Irma made landfall on the Camagüey Archipelago off the northern coast of Cuba, with sustained winds of .The strongest official sustained wind speed was , while the highest wind gust reached ; both were observed near Camila in Ciego de Ávila Province.The weather station at Esmeralda, Camagüey, was damaged, with the wind gauge destroyed.The north coast of Cuba experienced significant coastal flooding due to storm surge and abnormally high tides generated by the storm.Wave heights at Cayo Romano exceeded .Storm surge penetrated as far as inland in some areas of Villa Clara Province.Multiple locations on the island observed at least of rainfall, with a peak total of of precipitation at Topes de Collantes.\n\nA total of 158,554 homes experienced some degree of damage, of which 14,657 were destroyed; approximately 1.9 million people experienced the direct effects of Irma.The storm partially deroofed 103,691 homes, while 23,560 were completely deroofed.Irma damaged or destroyed 980 health facilities and 2,264 schools.Approximately 3.1 million people experienced disruptions to the water supply, while 246,707 people lost telephone service.About of roads were damaged.Crops also suffered extensively, with nearly affected by the storm.Throughout the country, the hurricane inflicted $13.185 billion in damage and killed 10 people, making Irma the costliest tropical cyclone in Cuban history.\n\nThe tourist areas of Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and Cayo Santa María and the nearby town of Caibarién received the brunt of the storm, with waves rolling through town and the characteristic one-story homes completely flooded.The storm most severely Ciego de Ávila and Villa Clara provinces.Flooding worsened as the hurricane moved west, pushing the storm surge along to the regions around Havana.By the afternoon, limited flooding was occurring in Havana, including around the Malecón.Portions of province coastal flooding surpassing that which was experienced during the Storm of the Century in 1993 and Hurricane Wilma in 2005.In the city of Santa Clara, 39 buildings collapsed.Rainfall resulted in several rivers reaching major flood stage.The town of Cabaiguán in Sancti Spíritus Province in particular suffered extensive inland flooding after the Zaza River swelled.\n\nHurricane Irma directly affected a major colony of American flamingos on Cuba\'s northern Cayo Coco.Early reports from Diario de Cuba indicated that several hundred flamingos had been killed by the storm, though other estimates ranged as high as several thousand birds.\n\nHurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida.Except for the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned.Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba, but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys.The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States.After surveying the aftermath of Irma, Florida governor Rick Scott said ""I thought we would see more damage""[on the mainland] but said ""he witnessed devastation in the Keys"".President Donald Trump commented on Twitter that the devastation in some places was ""far greater than anyone thought"".\n\nDamage in the United States was estimated at a minimum of $50 billion.At the time, Irma was the fourth costliest tropical cyclone in the United States, behind hurricanes Sandy in 2012, Harvey earlier that year, and Katrina in 2005.However, later in September 2017, Hurricane Maria became the third costliest United States tropical cyclone, causing Irma to fall to the fifth costliest.At least 92 people, 10 directly and 82 indirectly, died throughout the United States in relation to Irma: 84 in Florida, 3 in Georgia, 3 in South Carolina, and 2 in North Carolina.\n\nIrma struck the state less than two weeks after Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten had caused the worst flooding seen in western Florida in 20 years, which further worsened the impacts in the region.The storm\'s large wind field resulted in strong winds across much of Florida, except for the western Panhandle.The highest reported sustained wind speed was on Marco Island, while the strongest observed wind gust was , recorded near Naples, though wind gusts of likely occurred in the Middle Florida Keys.More than 7.7 million homes and businesses in Florida were left without electricity at some point – approximately 73% of state.Generally heavy amounts of rainfall were recorded to the east of the Irma\'s path, including a peak total of in Fort Pierce.Heavy precipitation – and storm surge, in some instances – overflowed at least 32 rivers and creeks, causing significant flooding, particularly along the St. Johns River and its tributaries.Many homes and businesses suffered damage or destruction, with more than 65,000 structures damaged to some degree in West Central and Southwest Florida alone.Agriculture experienced about $2.5 billion in damage.It was estimated that the cyclone caused at least $50 billion in damage, making Irma the costliest hurricane in Florida history, surpassing Hurricane Andrew, until it was itself surpassed by Hurricane Ian, 5 years later.\n\nThroughout Florida, at least 84 people died in storm-related incidents.About half of the deaths occurred from drowning, trauma, and carbon monoxide poisoning.Broward County had 21 fatalities, the most of any county in Florida.Among those deaths were 12 people at The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, a Hollywood nursing home.The patients died from sweltering heat worsened by the lack of air conditioning.The hurricane also left at least 14 deaths in Monroe County; 6 deaths in Orange County; 5 deaths each in Duval, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties; 4 deaths in both Highlands and Hillsborough counties; 3 deaths in both Marion and Polk counties; 2 deaths each in Collier, Hardee, Leon, Pinellas, St. Lucie, and Taylor counties; and 1 death in Hendry, Lake, Lee, Liberty, Manatee, Nassau, Okeechobee, Pasco, Seminole, St. Johns, and Volusia counties.\n\nWith Irma making landfall in Monroe County as a Category 4 hurricane, the Florida Keys were hardest hit area in the state.Strong winds and storm surge flooding caused major damage to buildings, trailer parks, boats, roads, the electricity supply, mobile phone coverage, internet access, sanitation, the water supply and the fuel supply throughout the island chain.An estimated storm surge occurred at Cudjoe Key, where Irma made landfall.Throughout the island, 625 homes sustained minor damage, 52 sustained major damage, and 81 were demolished.On Big Pine Key, one of the most devastated islands, 633 homes received minor impact, 299 homes received major impact, and 473 homes were completely destroyed.Overall in Monroe County, 27,649 homes experienced some degree of damage, including 1,179 homes being destroyed, 2,977 homes receiving major damage, and 5,361 suffering minor damage.\n\nAfter devastating the Keys, the storm then struck Collier County as a Category 3 hurricane.Several communities in the county suffered extensive damage, especially along the coast.Throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, 65 homes, including 44 mobile homes, were demolished, while 1,008 homes received major damage.Property damages in unincorporated areas alone reach about $320 million.Lee County was lashed by strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused prolonged flooding in some areas.More than 24,000 homes suffered some degree of damage, with almost 3,000 homes receiving major damage and 89 homes being destroyed.Damage in the county totaled about $857 million.\n\nImpact in much of the Miami metropolitan area was generally limited to extensive tree and fence damage, as well as widespread power outages.However, in Miami-Dade County, about 1,000 homes received major damage and about 50% of crops were lost.Storm surge caused coastal flooding from Homestead to Downtown Miami, as well as in portions of Miami Beach.Parts of the Florida Heartland were devastated by high winds and flooding, particularly Hendry and Highlands counties.In the former, which has most citrus trees of any county in Florida, about 60% of orange crops were lost.Throughout Hendry County, a total of 451 homes had minor damage, 131 homes suffered major damage, and 42 others were destroyed.In Highlands County, 13,138 businesses and homes were damaged to some degree, with 144 being destroyed, 963 sustaining major damage, and 2,408 receiving minor damage.In Orange County, wind gusts reached 79 mph at Orlando International Airport.A wind gust of 91 mph was also recorded in Orlando at the top of the Disney Contemporary Resort.Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central Florida left some wind damage and flooding, necessitating evacuations and rescues, including more than 200 people in Orlo Vista after hundreds of homes were flooded.A total of 2,999 business or homes were damaged in Lake County, 7,430 in Seminole County, and 3,457 in Volusia County.Additionally, eight tornadoes touched down in Brevard County, all of which caused damage.\n\nAlong much of the Gulf Coast of Florida, to the north of where Irma made landfall, negative storm surges were observed, with water retracting rather than pushing inland, causing little coastal flooding.However, on the opposite coast, extensive erosion and storm surge flooding occurred in the First Coast, especially in Duval and St. Johns counties.In Duval County, the St. Johns River crested at heights that exceeded records set during Hurricane Dora in 1964.Portions of Jacksonville experienced flooding, particularly the downtown area and the Riverside and San Marco neighborhoods, with about 350 people rescued in those sections of the city.Water reached about high in some homes.The city of Jacksonville suffered about $85 million in damage.\n\nIn St. Johns County, storm surge left extensive damage to oceanfront properties in Ponte Vedra Beach and Vilano Beach, with several becoming uninhabitable.Additionally, some riverfront businesses in St. Augustine\'s historic district were flooded due to storm surge from the Matanzas River.In nearby Clay County, rainfall and storm surge combined to cause extensive flooding along portions of the Black Creek and the St. Johns River, with record high crests at several locations along the former.About 350 people and 75 animals were rescued from floodwaters throughout the county.A total of 275 homes were destroyed, 175 were inflicted major damage, and 124 received minor damage.\n\nThree deaths were reported in Georgia due to falling trees and debris, along with widespread wind damage and power outages throughout the state primarily due to fallen trees.On Tybee Island, as well as St. Simons Island the storm surge caused extensive flooding.The tropical storm also did $54 million in damage in the state.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the third highest storm surge on record was recorded, reaching a height of approximately .By of September 12, almost 100,000 had lost power in Upstate South Carolina.Five people died in storm-related incidents across South Carolina, all from indirect incidents.The tropical storm caused damages totaling $500,000 in the state.\n\nLight damage occurred in other areas, including Tennessee.About 75,000 customers in North Carolina lost power due to Irma.It also caused $600,000 in damages in Alabama.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Irma\'s path through the West Indies and Caribbean, the devastation to roads, harbors and airports significantly impeded the transportation and distribution of relief supplies.Foreign countries moved to provide much of the initial aid.The British, Dutch, French, and United States governments sent warships and planes with supplies and manpower to the region.International leaders, including Dutch King Willem-Alexander and French President Emmanuel Macron, quickly moved to visit affected territories.\n\nSome of the affected countries and territories also offered assistance to each other.Cuba, which sustained extensive damage from the storm, sent 750 health workers to Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, Dominica, and Haiti.Government officials and members of the public in Puerto Rico delivered assistance and evacuated people stranded on other islands.The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services granted special 30-day humanitarian visas for British Virgin Islanders to stay in Puerto Rico.Hundreds of people stranded on Saint Martin were flown to the Dominican Republic on humanitarian grounds.\n\nIn response to Hurricane Jose\'s approach, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a mandatory evacuation on September 9 for any remaining residents on Barbuda.A Miami cargo plane landed on Antigua later that day, carrying over 60 tons (120,000 lbs) of relief supplies for the displaced storm victims—including bottled water, canned food and power generators.\n\nRFA Mounts Bay stationed itself near Anguilla and provided support and relief work to the island with its helicopters and 40 marines and army engineers.The ship delivered 6 tonnes of emergency aid to Anguilla and army engineers repaired a fuel leak at Anguilla\'s main petrol dump, restored power to the island\'s hospital and provided shelters for those left homeless by the hurricane.The ship arrived in the British Virgin Islands on September 8, 2017, to provide emergency relief to the islands, including providing shelters, food and water.HMS Ocean was diverted from the Mediterranean to provide relief from Gibraltar to the affected British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos on September 7, and aid was also supplied by the Department for International Development from their disaster response centre at Kemble Airfield.As part of a £32 million operation named Operation Ruman, nearly 500 UK military personnel with emergency relief were dispatched from RAF Brize Norton.This included the first deployment of No. 38 Expeditionary Air Wing with 3 RAF aircraft; 2 Airbus A400M Atlas and 1 C130J hercules to support relief efforts.\n\nThe British government also drafted 2 members of the UK police calibre into the region on September 10, and 53 police officers were drafted from RAF Brize Norton to the affected British Overseas Territories on September 15 to help maintain order.UK politicians, including the chairs of the foreign affairs and development select committees, criticized both the government\'s preparations for the storm and its response as inadequate.\n\nBy September 12, the Department for International Development had delivered more than 40 tonnes of aid into the region, including into Turks and Caicos, and 1,000 UK military troops were deployed in the region as part of relief efforts.The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, pledged an additional £25 million worth of funding as part of relief efforts in the region on September 13, 2017, and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Boris Johnson, said that a further 250 UK military personnel would be deployed into the area within the next few days.Anguilla\'s Chief Minister, Victor Banks, praised the British government\'s response to the storm and said that Boris Johnson\'s visit to the island ""sends a very positive signal to Anguillans that the British are serious about their response to this very severe hurricane"", but went on to say that the current financial commitment from the UK was not substantial enough.\n\nBy September 15, the United Kingdom had over 70 military personnel and 4 police officers in Anguilla and had delivered 15 tonnes of aid to the island.In the British Virgin Islands, Royal Marines had cleared the airfield so that it was operational for the delivery of aid into the islands, with more than 200 British military personnel and 54 UK police officers on the ground and 8 tonnes of aid delivered to the islands.120 British military personnel were on the ground in Turks and Caicos, and over 150 shelter kits and 720 liters of water were delivered to the islands on September 15.\n\nAmendments to international aid rules by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (or OECD) allowed for the UK government to provide access to £13 billion worth of aid to the affected British Overseas Territories, through the UK\'s Official Development Assistance (ODA) by November 2017.\n\nBy the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage.The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by Irma\'s eye, remained largely inaccessible for days.Assessments showed that 15% of the national telecommunications network had been affected, with at least one tower destroyed.Bahamasair resumed a limited domestic schedule on September 10, with international flights still cancelled due to existing and anticipated destruction at other destinations.\n\nThe worst devastation occurred on Ragged Island, over which Irma\'s eye had directly passed.After days of the National Emergency Management Agency not being able to physically reach the island, officials were finally able to inspect it; they promptly declared it uninhabitable.Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said that it was the worst disaster area he or his officials had ever seen, and that all remaining residents would need to leave, potentially permanently.Business leaders and other officials called for a new long-term development model to shift the population away from such sparsely-settled islands.\n\nOn Grand Bahama and Bimini, where tornadoes associated with Irma touched down on September 10, more than 100 people were left displaced.Infrastructure damage included docks, parks, and the power system.\n\nAside from tangible asset losses, Irma brought significant economic damages.International freight shipping was projected to be offline for a week, and costs for rebuilding supplies were inflated due to demand in the U.S.\n\nSwollen rivers contributed to worsening flooding in the days after the storm system left, resulting in additional evacuations.Officials resorted to using inflatable rafts to access affected areas.The national electrical infrastructure was said to be extensively damaged.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, flooding worsened following Irma\'s departure, leading the number of displaced persons to increase to more than 24,000 by September 8.President Danilo Medina ordered further evacuations due to at-risk dams, while the government banned swimming in rivers and ordered boats kept in port.More than 422,000 people were left without water due to 28 aqueducts being damaged.\n\nIn Haiti, officials stated that losses were greater than they could have been since people largely did not heed early preparation and evacuation warnings.At least 5,000 homes were flooded.One man died trying to cross a flooded river; another went missing and 17 were injured.The trash- and waste-contaminated floodwaters in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives led to fears of cholera outbreaks.Flooding continued to worsen days after the storm, as runoff from the mountains swelled rivers in low-lying farming communities.United Nations peacekeepers from Brazil were able to gain access to the flooded northwest region to provide urgent aid, but non-governmental organizations and Haitian economists warned that the estimated 30,000 victims would need longer-term assistance as well.Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant appointed a government commission to address Irma\'s effects, with Action Against Hunger in charge of humanitarian coordination.\n\nIn the USVI, residents and tourists alike were described as being in a state of traumatic shock.By September 7, the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship had arrived in the USVI to provide supplies, damage assessment, and evacuation assistance.Four additional warships, some of which had already been on their way to Texas to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief, were redirected to the region.At a September 10 news conference, Governor Kenneth Mapp described Irma as a ""horrific disaster"" for which ""[t]here will be no restorations or solutions in days or weeks.""The Federal Emergency Management Agency airlifted in goods for residents, who were subjected to a curfew.Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line agreed to transport tourists to Florida, contingent upon port availability following the state\'s own experience with Irma.\n\nOn Saint John, described as ""perhaps the site of Irma\'s worst devastation on American soil,"" it took six days for an active-theater disaster zone to be established, leading to criticism of the U.S. government response.The National Guard was delayed in reaching Saint John due to the number of overturned boats left in the harbor.The National Guard was brought in to maintain order, while the Coast Guard brought evacuees to cruise ships bound for San Juan and Miami.There was still no electricity on St. John in the middle of October 2017.\n\nBy September 9, more than one million Puerto Ricans were still without power, tens of thousands were without water, and several thousand were still in shelters.Hospitals were operating on generator power.The government was struggling to establish contact with the islands of Culebra and Vieques.By September 10, the main island had recovered enough to serve as a refuge for people stranded on other islands, including 1,200 tourists from Saint Martin and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Airlifts had brought more than 50 patients to Puerto Rico.\n\nFive months after Irma, two-thirds of the hospital beds on Saint Thomas were still unavailable, due to extensive physical damage and staffing shortages.\n\nDamage to Sint Maarten\'s harbour and to Princess Juliana International Airport left the Dutch part of Saint Martin unreachable, although the smaller Grand Case-Espérance Airport on the French side could be reopened by September 7 for supply aid by helicopter and airplane.The French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops on board a CASA/IPTN CN-235 aircraft.\n\nThe following day, the Dutch military was able to airlift dialysis patients off the island while also dropping leaflets to warn islanders about the rapidly approaching Hurricane Jose.Although the airport was closed, 435 students and faculty of the American University of the Caribbean were evacuated by the U.S. military.On September 10, Dutch King Willem-Alexander departed for the region, with intentions to visit Sint Maarten and other affected Dutch territories and commonwealth members.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron followed this announcement by stating his intentions to visit the French part of the island on September 12 in order to bring aid supplies.In response to criticism of the French handling of the disaster, 1,000 troops, police, and other emergency workers were sent to Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.\n\nOn both sides of Saint Martin, desperate conditions combined with food and water shortages in Irma\'s aftermath led to reports of violence, scavenging, and theft.In response, the French government increased its troop deployment to 2,200 and the Dutch government sent more than 600 military and police personnel.\n\nThe day after the hurricane hit Saint Barthelemy the French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops into the reopened Grand Case-Espérance Airport.On September 7 and 9, equipment and personnel were flown from France to Guadeloupe and Martinique.\n\nSporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm.\n\nOn September 11, Florida Governor Rick Scott conducted an aerial tour to survey the damage to the Keys.The Overseas Highway remained closed while authorities assessed the integrity of the 42 bridges along the route.Residents returning to the Keys were faced with a police roadblock, to the south of Florida City.USS Iwo Jima, USS New York and aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were sent to the Keys area to aid with the recovery.\n\nOn September 12, some residents were allowed to return into the Keys as far as Islamorada.Although road damage blocked entry any farther than Islamorada, bridges had been inspected and found safe to Sugarloaf Key.By late on September 12, the Overseas Highway had been repaired and the bridges inspected as safe for first responders to travel to Key West.On September 16, residents were free to return to Marathon.Residents were allowed to return to Key West the following day, although the Keys remained closed to tourists and a checkpoint remained in place in Florida City.\n\nDue mainly to the widespread loss of power, cell phone service was also reduced after battery backup power for cell phone towers ran out and backup generators ran out of fuel.In an impact report by the FCC, as of 11 AM EDT on September 12, 89 of 108 (82%) cell phone towers were non-functioning in Monroe County (Florida Keys), 154 of 212 (73%) were non-functioning in Collier County (Naples), 36 of 46 (78%) were non-functioning in Hendry County, and an additional six counties had 41-60% of cell phone towers not functioning, including Lee County (Fort Myers) and Miami-Dade County.\n\nNOAA released map-format aerial reconnaissance image data of damage from the storm.The imagery featured several areas of Florida: including the Florida Keys, the southwest coast of Florida from Marco Island to Punta Gorda, much of the northeast coast of Florida, and portions of the Jacksonville area.Portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts were also photographed.Additionally, the Sun-Sentinel published before and after photos of several landmarks in the Florida Keys.\n\nIn the days after the hurricane, due to the heavy rainfall, numerous rivers had flooded, including residential areas.Public health risks, such as diarrheal infections and mosquito-borne illnesses, remain from the flooding that resulted in the aftermath of the hurricane.A large concern from flooding is contamination because people become exposed to dirty floodwaters and the potential for contaminated water to enter the local water supply is significant.One example of an illness that can enter the water supply is leptospirosis, which is rat urine carries into the floodwaters.Untreated exposure to leptospirosis can cause kidney damage, meningitis, and liver failure.Noroviruses and other infections are also a risk.\n\nFollowing Irma\'s passage, a hand-carved wooden canoe was discovered on the banks of the Indian River and could be several hundred years old.The state has removed the canoe for examination and safe keeping.\n\nDue to Irma\'s and Hurricane Harvey\'s impact in Florida and Texas, U.S. employment declined in September 2017 for the first time since September 2010.The leisure and hospitality industries were especially hard hit, losing 111,000 jobs in September.\n\nIrma set multiple records for intensity, especially at easterly longitudes, time spent at such an intensity, and its intensity at landfall.When Irma reached Category 5 intensity with winds of at 11:45 UTC on September 5 at 57.7°W, it became the easternmost Atlantic hurricane of this strength on record, surpassing Hurricane David of 1979, later beaten by Hurricane Lorenzo 2 years later.By 00:15 UTC on September 6, Irma reached peak intensity with () winds and a minimum pressure of .This ties it with Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and Hurricane Rita of 2005 as the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed.Only five other Atlantic hurricanes have been recorded with wind speeds higher than Irma: Hurricane Allen of 1980, which had maximum sustained winds of , and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Gilbert of 1988, Hurricane Wilma of 2005, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, all of which had peak winds of .At the time, Irma was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; later surpassed by Hurricane Dorian, and was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007.In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category 5 strength winds, and the third-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, with a value of 64.9 units.Only the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane and Hurricane Ivan in 2004 achieved higher values.\n\nOn September 6, Irma made landfall on the islands of Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Virgin Gorda at peak strength.This ties Irma with cyclones Monica of 2006 and Winston of 2016, and typhoons Zeb of 1998 and Megi of 2010 as the seventh-strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall globally – in terms of sustained winds – trailing only Typhoon Goni of 2020 which bore winds of at landfall, Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 and Typhoon Meranti of 2016, which bore winds of at landfall, and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Typhoon Joan of 1959, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, which bore winds of at landfall.Irma is second to the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin, and is the first hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic at Category 5 status since Felix in 2007.Irma is the first recorded Category 5 hurricane to affect the northern Leeward Islands, and was one of the worst storms to hit the region on record, along with Hurricane Donna in 1960 and Hurricane Luis in 1995.In addition, Irma is only the second hurricane on record to make landfall in Cuba at Category 5 intensity, with the other being a hurricane in 1924.Furthermore, when Irma made landfall on Barbuda, Saint Martin, Virgin Gorda, and Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane, it became one of only two recorded Atlantic storms to make landfall in multiple nations at this strength; the other was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which struck both Eleuthera and the United States as a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nIrma made landfall in the Florida Keys with winds of and a pressure of , making it the strongest hurricane to strike Florida in terms of wind speed since Charley in 2004, and the most intense to strike the state in terms of barometric pressure since Andrew in 1992.In the span of two weeks, two Category 4 hurricanes—Harvey and Irma—struck the continental United States, the first time on record two Atlantic tropical cyclones of such strength made landfall on the country in the same hurricane season.This also marked only the third occurrence of two consecutive Atlantic storms making landfall in the United States as major hurricanes.The other two instances were the Great Charleston and Cheniere Caminada hurricanes in 1893, and hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne in 2004.\n\nBecause of the extensive damage and loss of life the hurricane caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Irma from its rotating naming lists in April 2018, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane.It was replaced with Idalia for the 2023 season.\n\nWeather of 2017 Tropical cyclones in 2017 List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes Operation RUMAN – UK military-civil disaster relief response to Hurricane Irma.List of Cuba hurricanes List

34,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Hurricane Irma', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'Hurricane Irma was an extremely powerful Cape Verde hurricane that caused widespread destruction across its path in early September 2017.Irma was the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the Leeward Islands on record, followed by Maria two weeks later.At the time, it was considered the most powerful hurricane on record in the open Atlantic region, outside of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, until it was surpassed by Hurricane Dorian two years later.It was also the third-strongest Atlantic hurricane at landfall ever recorded, just behind the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane and Dorian.The ninth named storm, fourth hurricane, second major hurricane, and first Category 5 hurricane of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Irma caused widespread and catastrophic damage throughout its long lifetime, particularly in the northeastern Caribbean and the Florida Keys.It was also the most intense hurricane to strike the continental United States since Katrina in 2005, the first major hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Wilma in the same year, and the first Category 4 hurricane to strike the state since Charley in 2004.The word Irmageddon was coined soon after the hurricane to describe the damage caused by the hurricane.\n\nIrma developed from a tropical wave near the Cape Verde Islands on August 30.Favorable conditions allowed Irma to rapidly intensify into a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson wind scale by late on August 31.The storm\'s intensity fluctuated between Categories 2 and 3 for the next several days, due to a series of eyewall replacement cycles.On September 4, Irma resumed intensifying, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by early on the next day.Early on September 6, Irma peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of and a minimum pressure of .Irma was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017 in terms of barometric pressure, and the strongest worldwide in 2017 in terms of wind speed.Another eyewall replacement cycle caused Irma to weaken back to a Category 4 hurricane, but the storm re-attained Category 5 status before making landfall in Cuba.Although Irma briefly weakened to a Category 2 storm while making landfall on Cuba, the system re-intensified to Category 4 status as it crossed the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, before making landfall on Cudjoe Key on September 10.Irma then weakened to Category 3 status, prior to another landfall in Florida on Marco Island later that day.The system degraded into a remnant low over Alabama and ultimately dissipated on September 13 over Missouri.\n\nThe storm caused catastrophic damage in Barbuda, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Anguilla, and the Virgin Islands as a Category 5 hurricane.The hurricane caused at least 134 deaths: one in Anguilla; one in Barbados; three in Barbuda; four in the British Virgin Islands; 10 in Cuba; 11 in the French West Indies; one in Haiti; three in Puerto Rico; four on the Dutch side of Sint Maarten; 92 in the contiguous United States, and four in the U.S. Virgin Islands.Hurricane Irma was the top Google searched term in the U.S. and globally in 2017.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa on August 26.The tropical wave moved off the coast of the continent late on August 27.Throughout the next two days, showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low-pressure area, as the system passed just south of and then through the Cape Verde Islands on August 29.Around 00:00 UTC on the following day, the system developed into a tropical depression just west of the Cape Verde Islands.Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Irma, based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates.With warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, strengthening was anticipated, with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier air.\n\nThe nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow, as an anticyclone became established over the system, with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images.Early on August 31, shortly after the development of a central dense overcast (CDO) and an eye feature, Irma underwent rapid intensification, becoming a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 UTC and then a Category 3 hurricane, becoming a major hurricane – around 00:00 UTC on September 1.Within a 48-hour period, the hurricane\'s intensity had increased by .On September 2, a ship passed to the west of the center of Irma, recording maximum winds of , which indicated that the eye of Irma remained compact.A strong high pressure system to the north of Irma caused the storm to move west-southwestward between September 2 and September 4.The first aircraft reconnaissance mission departed from Barbados on the afternoon of September 3, discovering an eye in diameter and surface winds of .\n\nOn September 4, after moving into more favorable conditions, Irma strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane.As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by 12:00 UTC on the following day, with winds of .The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at near 18:00 UTC on September 5. Irma acquired annular characteristics around this time, with the storm exhibiting a large, symmetric CDO and an impressive satellite appearance.Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern Leeward Islands.Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of Barbuda at peak intensity, with the storm\'s central minimum pressure having bottomed out at – this was the lowest in the Atlantic since Dean in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of .Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15 UTC on Sint Maarten, and at 16:30 UTC on Virgin Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands, though the storm\'s central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall.\n\nAs the hurricane moved away from the Virgin Islands late on September 6, observations from reconnaissance flights, as well as Doppler radar in San Juan, Puerto Rico, indicated an elliptical eye and double eyewalls.Late on September 6, the cyclone passed about north of Puerto Rico.Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of Hispaniola throughout the day on September 7.After beginning an eyewall replacement cycle, Irma weakened to a Category 4 hurricane as it passed south of the Turks and Caicos Islands early on September 8.This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category 5 intensity, the second-longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above – behind only the 1932 Cuba hurricane.At 05:00 UTC on September 8, Irma made landfall on the island of Little Inagua in the Bahamas with sustained winds of .The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a subtropical ridge to its north.Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category 5 intensity at 18:00 UTC that day east of Cuba as deep convection became more pronounced and organized.The hurricane then made landfall in Cayo Romano, Cuba, at 03:00 UTC on September 9, with winds of .This made Irma only the second Category 5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the 1924 Cuba hurricane.As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category 2 storm later on September 9.\n\nAfter slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards Florida around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental United States.Moving over the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, Irma quickly restrengthened to a Category 4 hurricane at 06:00 UTC on September 10, as deep convection improved and the eye became better defined.In addition, Irma\'s wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of and gale-force winds spanning in diameter.The cyclone made landfall in Cudjoe Key, Florida, at 13:00 UTC on September 10, at Category 4 intensity, with winds of .Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category 3 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30 UTC, in Marco Island, Florida, with sustained winds of .Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category 3 intensity hours after landfall.Passing east of Tampa as a weakening Category 1 hurricane around 06:00 UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation – though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds.The system finally weakened to a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC that day as it entered southern Georgia, while acquiring some extratropical characteristics.At 06:00 UTC on September 12, Irma degenerated to a remnant low just as it entered Alabama, as most of the deep convection had diminished.The remnants persisted for another day or so before dissipating over Missouri on September 13.\n\nGiven that Irma\'s forecast track was along much of the Caribbean island chain, hurricane warnings were issued for the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and parts of Hispaniola on September 5.\n\nIn Antigua and Barbuda, residents safeguarded their homes and cleaned up their properties in anticipation of strong winds.Emergency crews were put on standby at public shelters and hospitals by September 5 to assist with any evacuations.Expecting a direct hit, more than half of the residents on Barbuda took shelter, and relief supplies were preemptively mobilized.The National Emergency Management Organization on Saint Lucia urged small craft operators and swimmers to be mindful of forecasts for high surf.Small Craft Warnings and High Surf Advisories were hoisted for Dominica, where residents were urged to remain vigilant of the potential for high waves, landslides, and flooding.\n\nIn Guadeloupe, low-lying and cliff-edge homes were evacuated at the threat of flooding and erosion.Schools and public businesses closed on September 5 and 6.Hospitals stocked up on three days\' worth of supplies and checked the functionality of their generators.Of the island\'s 32 communes, 22 activated their emergency plans; 1,500 people were urged to take shelter.The island sustained relatively minor damage and became the base for relief efforts on Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.Though the core of the hurricane was expected to remain north of the island, a yellow alert was issued for Martinique due to the likelihood of rough seas.The island dispatched relief supplies and military reinforcements to its neighboring islands of Guadeloupe, Saint Martin.and Saint Barthélemy, which faced a greater risk of a direct impact.\n\nOn September 4, Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency.By September 6, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency had deployed response teams in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.Supplies, including food rations, medical supplies, and blankets, were pre-staged in strategic locations on the islands for distribution.\n\nOn September 5, the Dominican Republic activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage; the United States and Haiti followed suit two days later.According to officials, 11,200 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas prior to the storm\'s arrival.Approximately 7,400 tourists were moved to Santo Domingo, away from beach resorts.In Haiti, government officials and aid organizations struggled with early preparation and evacuation efforts.While some officials blamed reluctance and indifference on the part of the population, others ""admitted they were not prepared for the onslaught and no mandatory evacuation orders were in place ahead of Irma\'s approach.""Local officials contended that they had not received promised funds, supplies, or equipment from the national government.The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti prepared its 1,000 peacekeepers and engineers to assist.\n\nIn the Turks and Caicos, evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas starting September 5. Schools were closed, government buildings were boarded up, and shelters were opened.Officials spread warnings to residents in English, Creole, and Spanish via social media, radio, SMS text, and WhatsApp.In The Bahamas, the government began preparations the week prior to the hurricane\'s arrival, including securing national sports facilities to use as shelters.By September 7, the government had evacuated 1,609 people by air from the southern islands, including 365 from Bimini.Controlled cutting of the power supply to southern and central Bahamian islands was conducted in advance of the storm.Shelters were made available, though usage was low due to most evacuees staying with family on other islands.Of the 2,679 foreign tourists still in The Bahamas on September 7, about 1,200 were being housed at Atlantis Paradise Island, one of the most hurricane-ready structures in the country.\n\nIn Cuba, meteorologists did not initially predict a direct hit.Fuel conservation was enacted in Camagüey Province to ensure that enough would be available during post-storm power outages.The Civil Defense evacuated nearly one million people from low-lying areas, including thousands of Canadian and European tourists in the Jardines del Rey.Dolphins at a Cayo Guillermo resort were evacuated by helicopter.\n\nThe NHC issued several watches and warnings for the Southeastern United States.The first watches and warnings were issued at 15:00 UTC on September 7, which was a hurricane watch from the Jupiter Inlet to Bonita Beach, including the Florida Keys and Lake Okeechobee.The watches and warnings were extended into Georgia and South Carolina on September 9.At 21:00 UTC on that day, the advisories reached their maximum extent, with a hurricane warning covering the entire east coast of the state, the west coast from Indian Pass southward, and the Florida Keys; a hurricane watch was in place from the Florida–Georgia state line to Edisto Beach, South Carolina; and there were two tropical storm warnings, one in Florida from Indian Pass to the Okaloosa–Walton county line and the other from the Florida–Georgia state line to the South Santee River in South Carolina.Watches and warnings were gradually discontinued as Irma moved inland and weakened, with all of them canceled by early on September 12.\n\nOn September 4, Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency.Governor Scott placed 100 members of the Florida National Guard on duty to assist in preparations.All 7,000 troops were ordered to be on duty by September 8.Officials advised residents to stock their hurricane kits.The state coordinated with electrical companies in order for power outages to be restored as quickly as possible, extending resources such as equipment, fuel, and lodging for the approximately 24,000 restoration personnel who had been activated.Governor Scott suspended tolls on all toll roads in Florida, including the turnpike.All state offices in Florida were closed from September 8 to September 11, while public schools, state colleges, and state universities in all 67 counties were closed during the same period.The Florida Department of Education coordinated with school districts as the need for transportation by school buses and opening shelters arose.By September 9, more than 150 state parks were closed.Throughout the state, almost 700 emergency shelters were opened.The shelters collectively housed about 191,764 people, with more than 40% of them staying in a shelter in South Florida.Additionally, more than 60 special needs shelters were opened, which housed more than 5,000 people by September 9.\n\nMany airports across the state, particularly in Central and South Florida, were closed.Nearly 9,000 flights intending to arrive in or depart from Florida were canceled.Along Florida\'s coasts, most seaports were closed or opened with restricted access.For the fifth time in its 45-year history, the Walt Disney World Resort was completely closed due to the storm.Its theme parks, water parks, and Disney Springs were all closed by 9:00 p.m. on September 9 and remained closed until September 12.Other Orlando-area theme parks, including Universal Orlando Resort and SeaWorld Orlando, were also closed.The Kennedy Space Center was closed from September 8 to September 15.\n\nAn estimated 6.5 million Floridians were ordered to evacuate, mostly those living on barrier islands or in coastal areas; in mobile or sub-standard homes; and in low-lying or flood prone areas.Mandatory evacuations were ordered for portions of Brevard, Broward, Citrus, Collier, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Glades, Hendry, Hernando, Indian River, Lee, Martin, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Lucie, Sumter, and Volusia counties.All of Monroe County, where the Florida Keys are located, was placed under a mandatory evacuation.Residents in communities near the southern half of Lake Okeechobee were also ordered to leave.Additionally, voluntary evacuation notices were issued for all or parts of Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Charlotte, Columbia, Desoto, Hardee, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lake, Manatee, Okeechobee, Osceola, and Polk counties.\n\nA record 6.5 million Floridians evacuated, making it the largest evacuation in the state\'s history.Evacuees caused significant traffic congestion on northbound Interstate 95, Interstate 75, and Florida\'s Turnpike, exacerbated by the fact that the entire Florida peninsula was within the cone of uncertainty in the NHC\'s forecast path in the days before the storm, so evacuees from both coasts headed north, as evacuees would not be safer by fleeing to the opposite coast.Fuel was in short supply throughout peninsular Florida during the week before Irma\'s arrival, especially along evacuation routes, leading to hours-long lines at fuel stations and even escorts of fuel trucks by the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nUse of the left shoulder as a lane for moving traffic was allowed on northbound Interstate 75 from Wildwood to the Georgia state line beginning September 8 and on eastbound Interstate 4 from Tampa to State Road 429 near Celebration for a few hours on September 9.It was the first time that the shoulder-use plan, which was introduced at the start of the 2017 hurricane season, was implemented by the state for hurricane evacuations.The shoulder-use plan was implemented in place of labor- and resource-intensive contraflow lane reversal, in which both sides of an interstate highway are used for one direction of traffic.\n\nOfficials from the Environmental Protection Agency, which had been criticized for its response to Hurricane Harvey, took special measures to inspect and secure hazardous materials, especially at Superfund sites.Direct Relief, a disaster relief organization, coordinated with local health centers and provided resources to help facilities on the front lines of Floridian and Puerto Rican communities.\n\nGeorgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency initially for all six coastal counties on September 6, but eventually expanded the declaration to 94 counties south of Atlanta metropolitan area, and then the entire state on September 10.Atlanta was placed under its first-ever tropical storm warning.Governor Deal ordered mandatory evacuations for all areas east of Interstate 95 on September 7, before extending the order to the entirety of Chatham County and low-lying areas west of I-95 on the following day.In total, 540,000 people on the Georgia coast were ordered to leave.Contraflow lane reversal for Interstate 16 took effect on the morning of September 9 from Savannah to Dublin, Georgia.All Georgia state parks were open for free to evacuees, as was the 800-acre camping area at Atlanta Motor Speedway.Reversible HOT lanes on Interstate 75 in Georgia through south metro Atlanta were open 24 hours northbound with no tolls.\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on September 6, with South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster following suit the same day.Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency on September 8 in order to protect Virginia residents and to mobilize resources in support of neighboring states.Officials in New Orleans stated that there would not be much time for preparations if Irma failed to make the projected northward turn, but that South Texas or Florida would not be a good evacuation destination.On September 10, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam issued an executive order allowing medical professionals in other states to practice in Tennessee to aid Hurricane Irma evacuees.This order also allowed pharmacies to give out 14-day supplies of medicine, and gave women and children from outside the state the ability to participate in the Tennessee Department of Health programs.Bristol Motor Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway, and Charlotte Motor Speedway all opened their campgrounds to evacuees free of charge.\n\nIn professional sports, the Miami Dolphins–Tampa Bay Buccaneers game scheduled for September 10 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was postponed to November 19 due to the storm\'s threat.The Dolphins left early for their road game against the Los Angeles Chargers.The Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees moved their September 11–13 series from Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg to Citi Field in Queens.Minor League Baseball\'s Florida State League, Carolina League, and Southern League called off their championship finals and as a result, named their division series winners league co-champions.The Miami FC versus San Francisco Deltas match on September 10 was cancelled so the players and staff could prepare for the storm with their families.The Orlando Pride of the National Women\'s Soccer League rescheduled their September 9 match to September 7. Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer did not have any scheduled home games in September, but was unable to return to training facilities in Orlando due to Hurricane Irma.\n\nIn college football, the UCF Knights-Memphis Tigers game scheduled for September 9 was moved to September 30, replacing UCF\'s game against Maine and Memphis game against Georgia State.UCF also cancelled their game against Georgia Tech on September 16, as UCF\'s stadium hosted the National Guard.The USF Bulls-Connecticut Huskies football game was also cancelled.The Miami Hurricanes–Arkansas State Redwolves game scheduled for September 9 at Centennial Bank Stadium in Arkansas was canceled due to travel concerns for the University of Miami.The Florida Gators-Northern Colorado Bears match in Gainesville scheduled for September 9 was cancelled.The Florida State Seminoles contest against the Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks was canceled on September 8.The Seminoles\' rivalry game with the Hurricanes in Tallahassee, originally scheduled for September 16, was postponed tp October 7.The FIU Panthers game against the Alcorn State Braves was moved up a day and relocated to Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.The Georgia Southern Eagles game against the New Hampshire Wildcats on September 9 was also moved to Legion Field for that day.\n\nAs of September 5, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding was running dangerously low, due to its response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas the previous week, prompting the Trump administration to request an immediate $8 billion in additional funding as Irma approached Florida.Given the rate that current funds are being consumed and the catastrophic damage, the United States Senate almost doubled the requested amount to $15.3 billion, with the understanding that this would only be about 10% of what will be required for responding to Harvey.\n\nHurricane Irma\'s path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating, with landfalls in Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Martin, the Bahamas, Cuba, and the United States, all at major hurricane intensity.Furthermore, the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences.Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria.\n\nThe eyewall of the hurricane moved over Barbuda near its record peak intensity early on September 6; a weather station observed a wind gust of .The same station also recorded a minimum barometric pressure of .The exact state of the island remained unclear for hours after Irma\'s passage, as downed phone lines ceased all communication with nearby islands.Later that afternoon, Prime Minister Gaston Browne surveyed the territory by helicopter, revealing an effectively uninhabitable island.Irma damaged or destroyed 95% of the structures on Barbuda, including its hospital, schools, and both of its hotels; it completely flattened some residential blocks while submerging others.The destruction rendered the island\'s sole airport and much of its infrastructure inoperative—including water and telecommunication services—which further hampered relief efforts.Property damage on Barbuda ranged from $150 million to $300 million.A total of three storm-related deaths were reported on the island.\n\nIn addition to the catastrophic impact on Barbuda\'s human residents, concern turned to the storm\'s effects on the island\'s wildlife.The island\'s only endemic bird, the near-threatened Barbuda warbler, numbered less than 2,000 individuals prior to the hurricane.For some time it was unknown if the warbler survived the hurricane or its aftermath; however within a few months it was confirmed that not only did the species survive, but the most of the birds survived the storm.Barbuda\'s Codrington Lagoon, home to the largest colony of magnificent frigatebirds in the Caribbean, with an estimated 2,500 nesting pairs, was also inundated by the storm surge.\n\nRemaining just outside of Irma\'s strongest windfield, Antigua sustained less severe damage, in the form of leveled roofs and fences, downed power poles and lines, and uprooted trees.Some street flooding also took place in low-lying areas.Three people were treated for minor storm-related injuries.Forensic disaster analysts from the Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM), a Germany-based risk management agency, estimate that economic losses for Antigua and Barbuda will exceed $120 million.\n\nOn the morning of September 6, Irma\'s center crossed the island of Saint Martin while the storm was at peak intensity, sweeping away entire structures, submerging roads and cars, and triggering an island-wide blackout.Irma\'s extreme winds ripped trees out of the ground and sent vehicles and debris from damaged structures scattered across the territory.On the French side of Saint-Martin, entire marinas around Marigot were left in ruins, littered with the stranded remnants of boats that had smashed into each other.A hotel caught on fire, but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze.Another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor.Media images depicted devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds had shattered their windows.Irma killed four people on the French side of the island and injured 50 others, one of whom was in critical condition.As many as 95% of the buildings there were damaged to some degree; 60% of those were totally uninhabitable.Estimates from CEDIM indicate a minimum of $950 million worth of economic losses.Total losses exceeded €3.5 billion (US$4.17 billion).\n\nA similar situation unfolded in Sint Maarten, Saint Martin\'s Dutch half, as intense winds ripped through buildings and lifted vehicles aloft ""as if they were matches"".The hurricane wreaked havoc on Princess Juliana International Airport, with ""huge chunks of the building [strewn] across the runway and a jet bridge snapped in half.""It demolished or severely damaged about 70% of Sint Maarten\'s houses, forcing thousands of residents into public shelters.There were 4 deaths and 23 injuries, 11 of which were serious, in the Dutch territory.Irma is considered the worst natural disaster to hit Sint Maarten; the extent of its damage far exceeded that of any previous hurricane.Total damages were estimated at €2.5 billion (US$2.98 billion).\n\nIrma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the French island of Saint Barthélemy, southeast of Saint Martin.Describing the extent of the destruction, one local compared it to ""a bomb that burned all vegetation,"" while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively ""erased the island from the map"".Violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments, with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation.Streets in the capital of Gustavia were turned into rushing rivers, which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture.The island\'s fire station was inundated with up to of flood waters.With scores of homes and much of the infrastructure destroyed, the majority of the island\'s population was left stranded and without water, electricity or phone service.The associated economic losses could exceed $480 million according to CEDIM\'s analysts.\n\nPreliminary assessments from the French government indicate that Hurricane Irma caused a combined €1.2 billion (US$1.43 billion) in insured losses across the French territories of Saint-Martin and Saint Barts.This total covered private property such as homes, vehicles and businesses (including lost revenue); the extent of the damage to infrastructural and public facilities remains undetermined.Nonetheless, this made Irma one of the costliest natural disasters to hit the French Republic in 50 years.\n\nOn January 30, 2018, roughly five months after Irma, an analysis was published indicating that an anemometer on the island recorded an unofficial gust to before failing.\n\nThe British Overseas Territory of Anguilla saw the eyewall of the storm pass over it on September 6.Many homes and schools were destroyed, and the island\'s only hospital was badly damaged.The devastation was particularly severe in East End, where the winds uprooted scores of trees and power poles and demolished a number of houses.In The Valley, the island\'s capital, the hurricane blew out the windows of government buildings.Rough seas inflicted heavy damage upon several bays and harbors, and a seaside restaurant was completely eradicated.About 90% of roads were left impassable.The island\'s air traffic control tower was damaged, exacerbating the already poor communication with the island.One death was reported on the island.Estimates of losses on the island total at least $190 million.\n\nLarge swells ahead of Irma washed ashore debris and sea life in Castries, Saint Lucia, blocking some roads.Seaside roads were inundated with water.One surfer was killed amid rough surf in Barbados after hitting a reef and breaking his neck.Trees were also destroyed.The hurricane\'s effects, such as violent seas and rattling trees, were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in Guadeloupe.Several houses were damaged.Around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm, leaving several communes in the dark without running water.Overall damage was limited to external parts of houses and trees that were blown onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seas.\n\nSaint Kitts and Nevis endured similar conditions to other islands.Blustery rainstorms triggered scattered power outages and disabled the island\'s water system, but per the International Red Cross, the islands were spared the level of destruction seen elsewhere.Still, Prime Minister Timothy Harris stated that property and infrastructure had sustained ""significant damage.""The Dutch territories of Saba and Sint Eustatius were also struck by the hurricane\'s winds, resulting in infrastructural damage, water shortages and telecommunication outages.Several houses were left uninhabitable.On Saba, the hurricane also defoliated trees and injured a few people.CEDIM\'s analysts expect economic losses of $20–65 million for the two islands.\n\nDamage in the British Virgin Islands was extensive.Numerous buildings and roads were destroyed on the island of Tortola, which bore the brunt of the hurricane\'s core.Four people were confirmed dead.Along Cane Garden Bay, the storm surge submerged several seaside bars and a gas station.Satellite images revealed many of the island\'s residential zones had been left in ruins.The hurricane passed over Necker Island, also causing severe damage and destroying the mansion of Richard Branson.\n\nMost homes and businesses were destroyed on the island of Jost Van Dyke, the smallest of the B.V.I.\'s four main islands.The Governor, Gus Jaspert, who had only been sworn into office 13 days previously, declared a state of emergency - the first time this has ever happened in the Territory.After the storm, restoration of electricity took approximately 5 months.\n\nIrma\'s effects in the U.S. Virgin Islands were most profound on Saint Thomas, where at least of rain fell, and on Saint John.Saint Thomas island suffered widespread structural damage, including to its police station and airport.Patients from the fourth and third floors of Charlotte Amalie\'s hospital had to be relocated to lower floors due to flooding from roof leaks.Three deaths were attributed to Irma on the island.On nearby Saint Croix, there were communication issues and some damage to the infrastructure.Saint John lost access to ferry and cargo services, along with access to the local airport.Due to its normal reliance on electricity from Saint Thomas, the island was left without power.Total damage from the three islands was at least $1.1 billion.\n\nThe hurricane passed north of Puerto Rico, but still caused significant damage to the United States territory.Along the coast, a tide gauge observed waves up to mean higher high water.Much of the main island experienced sustained tropical storm force winds, with a peak sustained wind speed of at a weather station along San Juan Bay, while the same site observed a peak wind gust of .However, on the island of Culebra, a wind gust of was reported.Mainly due to strong winds, approximately 1.1 million out of 1.5 million of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority\'s customers lost electricity.Portions of Puerto Rico received heavy rainfall, with a peak total of in Bayamón, causing seven rivers to reach flood stage, widespread flash flooding, and at least six landslides.\n\nThe most severely affected areas included the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques, as well as the northeastern, northern, and mountainous portions of the main island.On Culebra, the island suffered an almost complete loss of electrical and water services.At least 30 homes on the island were destroyed, while about 30 other experienced substantial damage.High winds also toppled a number of trees.The only telecommunications tower on Culebra sustained damage, cutting off outside communications for several hours.In rural Loíza, 79 homes were destroyed.Throughout Puerto Rico, 781 out of 1,600 telecommunications towers went out of commission, primarily due to power outages.At least 362,000 customers lost water services.Debris, mostly fallen trees, blocked at least 72 roads.Approximately 25% to 30% of banana, coffee, papaya, and plantain crops were damaged by strong winds, with losses to farmers estimated at $30.6 million.Approximately 1,530 homes experienced at least moderate damage, with 1,448 homes moderately damaged, 32 extensively damaged, and 50 completely destroyed.\n\nHurricane Irma was attributed to around $1 billion in damage, and the NHC attributed three fatalities to Irma in Puerto Rico, though four deaths were related to the storm.Two people died due to rainstorms ahead of the hurricane: one man died in Orocovis after falling off his ladder while repairing his roof; another man on the coast in Capitanejo died after being struck by lightning.Three nearby fishermen were burned by the same lightning strike, but survived.Two other people died during the hurricane: a woman died while being evacuated from her house in a wheelchair and fell, hitting her head; another person died in a car accident in Canóvanas.Governor Ricardo Rosselló declared the islands of Culebra and Vieques to be disaster areas.\n\nAlthough spared a direct hit, both the Dominican Republic and Haiti were affected by high winds and heavy rains.A bridge over the Dajabón River connecting the two countries was broken.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, the fishing community of Nagua sustained damage from waves that destroyed homes.55,000 soldiers were deployed to affected areas to help with the clean-up efforts.By the evening of September 7, the government had counted 2,721 damaged homes.\n\nIn Haiti, flooding one meter deep sat in residential neighborhoods in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives.Mudslides, destroyed homes, flooded crops, and infrastructure damage were reported in the northern part of the country.The total expanse of the flooding stretched from Môle-Saint-Nicolas in the west to the eastern border with the Dominican Republic.\n\nOn the evening of September 7, at 7:30 pm AST (23:30 UTC), Hurricane Irma reached the Turks and Caicos Islands.While the eye passed just south of the main islands, crossing over South Caicos and the Ambergris Cays, the most powerful winds on the northern side of the eye swept all of the islands for more than two hours.Communications infrastructure was destroyed.\n\nOn September 8, Minister of Infrastructure Goldray Ewing confirmed that damage to Providenciales was extensive, with the northwestern neighborhood of Blue Hill being ""gone"".The hospital in the capital, Cockburn Town, was heavily damaged.On South Caicos, 75% of roofs were lost.Total damage was estimated at over $500 million.\n\nIn the Bahamas, the eye of the storm passed over Duncan Town, the major settlement of the Ragged Islands chain, on September 8.It also passed ""almost directly over"" Inagua and South Acklins, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.\n\nDamages were largely confined to the southern islands starting the morning of September 8.On Mayaguana and Great Inagua, downed power lines knocked out communications.On Great Inagua, 70% of homes sustained roof damage, and the island\'s school lost its roof entirely.The Morton Salt Company\'s signature production facility, one of the major employers in the country, experienced millions of dollars in damages.The Acklins settlement of Salina Point was cut off from the rest of the island by flooding, while Crooked Island had widespread roof damage.In the northern Bahamas, the worst property damage came on September 10 as the outer bands of the system produced tornadic activity on Grand Bahama and Bimini.Damage and losses across The Bahamas amounted to $135 million.\n\nWhile Irma was making landfall in Florida, the ocean was drawn away from some western shorelines of the Bahamas due to strong easterly winds.\n\nEarly on September 9, Irma made landfall on the Camagüey Archipelago off the northern coast of Cuba, with sustained winds of .The strongest official sustained wind speed was , while the highest wind gust reached ; both were observed near Camila in Ciego de Ávila Province.The weather station at Esmeralda, Camagüey, was damaged, with the wind gauge destroyed.The north coast of Cuba experienced significant coastal flooding due to storm surge and abnormally high tides generated by the storm.Wave heights at Cayo Romano exceeded .Storm surge penetrated as far as inland in some areas of Villa Clara Province.Multiple locations on the island observed at least of rainfall, with a peak total of of precipitation at Topes de Collantes.\n\nA total of 158,554 homes experienced some degree of damage, of which 14,657 were destroyed; approximately 1.9 million people experienced the direct effects of Irma.The storm partially deroofed 103,691 homes, while 23,560 were completely deroofed.Irma damaged or destroyed 980 health facilities and 2,264 schools.Approximately 3.1 million people experienced disruptions to the water supply, while 246,707 people lost telephone service.About of roads were damaged.Crops also suffered extensively, with nearly affected by the storm.Throughout the country, the hurricane inflicted $13.185 billion in damage and killed 10 people, making Irma the costliest tropical cyclone in Cuban history.\n\nThe tourist areas of Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and Cayo Santa María and the nearby town of Caibarién received the brunt of the storm, with waves rolling through town and the characteristic one-story homes completely flooded.The storm most severely Ciego de Ávila and Villa Clara provinces.Flooding worsened as the hurricane moved west, pushing the storm surge along to the regions around Havana.By the afternoon, limited flooding was occurring in Havana, including around the Malecón.Portions of province coastal flooding surpassing that which was experienced during the Storm of the Century in 1993 and Hurricane Wilma in 2005.In the city of Santa Clara, 39 buildings collapsed.Rainfall resulted in several rivers reaching major flood stage.The town of Cabaiguán in Sancti Spíritus Province in particular suffered extensive inland flooding after the Zaza River swelled.\n\nHurricane Irma directly affected a major colony of American flamingos on Cuba\'s northern Cayo Coco.Early reports from Diario de Cuba indicated that several hundred flamingos had been killed by the storm, though other estimates ranged as high as several thousand birds.\n\nHurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida.Except for the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned.Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba, but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys.The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States.After surveying the aftermath of Irma, Florida governor Rick Scott said ""I thought we would see more damage""[on the mainland] but said ""he witnessed devastation in the Keys"".President Donald Trump commented on Twitter that the devastation in some places was ""far greater than anyone thought"".\n\nDamage in the United States was estimated at a minimum of $50 billion.At the time, Irma was the fourth costliest tropical cyclone in the United States, behind hurricanes Sandy in 2012, Harvey earlier that year, and Katrina in 2005.However, later in September 2017, Hurricane Maria became the third costliest United States tropical cyclone, causing Irma to fall to the fifth costliest.At least 92 people, 10 directly and 82 indirectly, died throughout the United States in relation to Irma: 84 in Florida, 3 in Georgia, 3 in South Carolina, and 2 in North Carolina.\n\nIrma struck the state less than two weeks after Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten had caused the worst flooding seen in western Florida in 20 years, which further worsened the impacts in the region.The storm\'s large wind field resulted in strong winds across much of Florida, except for the western Panhandle.The highest reported sustained wind speed was on Marco Island, while the strongest observed wind gust was , recorded near Naples, though wind gusts of likely occurred in the Middle Florida Keys.More than 7.7 million homes and businesses in Florida were left without electricity at some point – approximately 73% of state.Generally heavy amounts of rainfall were recorded to the east of the Irma\'s path, including a peak total of in Fort Pierce.Heavy precipitation – and storm surge, in some instances – overflowed at least 32 rivers and creeks, causing significant flooding, particularly along the St. Johns River and its tributaries.Many homes and businesses suffered damage or destruction, with more than 65,000 structures damaged to some degree in West Central and Southwest Florida alone.Agriculture experienced about $2.5 billion in damage.It was estimated that the cyclone caused at least $50 billion in damage, making Irma the costliest hurricane in Florida history, surpassing Hurricane Andrew, until it was itself surpassed by Hurricane Ian, 5 years later.\n\nThroughout Florida, at least 84 people died in storm-related incidents.About half of the deaths occurred from drowning, trauma, and carbon monoxide poisoning.Broward County had 21 fatalities, the most of any county in Florida.Among those deaths were 12 people at The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, a Hollywood nursing home.The patients died from sweltering heat worsened by the lack of air conditioning.The hurricane also left at least 14 deaths in Monroe County; 6 deaths in Orange County; 5 deaths each in Duval, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties; 4 deaths in both Highlands and Hillsborough counties; 3 deaths in both Marion and Polk counties; 2 deaths each in Collier, Hardee, Leon, Pinellas, St. Lucie, and Taylor counties; and 1 death in Hendry, Lake, Lee, Liberty, Manatee, Nassau, Okeechobee, Pasco, Seminole, St. Johns, and Volusia counties.\n\nWith Irma making landfall in Monroe County as a Category 4 hurricane, the Florida Keys were hardest hit area in the state.Strong winds and storm surge flooding caused major damage to buildings, trailer parks, boats, roads, the electricity supply, mobile phone coverage, internet access, sanitation, the water supply and the fuel supply throughout the island chain.An estimated storm surge occurred at Cudjoe Key, where Irma made landfall.Throughout the island, 625 homes sustained minor damage, 52 sustained major damage, and 81 were demolished.On Big Pine Key, one of the most devastated islands, 633 homes received minor impact, 299 homes received major impact, and 473 homes were completely destroyed.Overall in Monroe County, 27,649 homes experienced some degree of damage, including 1,179 homes being destroyed, 2,977 homes receiving major damage, and 5,361 suffering minor damage.\n\nAfter devastating the Keys, the storm then struck Collier County as a Category 3 hurricane.Several communities in the county suffered extensive damage, especially along the coast.Throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, 65 homes, including 44 mobile homes, were demolished, while 1,008 homes received major damage.Property damages in unincorporated areas alone reach about $320 million.Lee County was lashed by strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused prolonged flooding in some areas.More than 24,000 homes suffered some degree of damage, with almost 3,000 homes receiving major damage and 89 homes being destroyed.Damage in the county totaled about $857 million.\n\nImpact in much of the Miami metropolitan area was generally limited to extensive tree and fence damage, as well as widespread power outages.However, in Miami-Dade County, about 1,000 homes received major damage and about 50% of crops were lost.Storm surge caused coastal flooding from Homestead to Downtown Miami, as well as in portions of Miami Beach.Parts of the Florida Heartland were devastated by high winds and flooding, particularly Hendry and Highlands counties.In the former, which has most citrus trees of any county in Florida, about 60% of orange crops were lost.Throughout Hendry County, a total of 451 homes had minor damage, 131 homes suffered major damage, and 42 others were destroyed.In Highlands County, 13,138 businesses and homes were damaged to some degree, with 144 being destroyed, 963 sustaining major damage, and 2,408 receiving minor damage.In Orange County, wind gusts reached 79 mph at Orlando International Airport.A wind gust of 91 mph was also recorded in Orlando at the top of the Disney Contemporary Resort.Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central Florida left some wind damage and flooding, necessitating evacuations and rescues, including more than 200 people in Orlo Vista after hundreds of homes were flooded.A total of 2,999 business or homes were damaged in Lake County, 7,430 in Seminole County, and 3,457 in Volusia County.Additionally, eight tornadoes touched down in Brevard County, all of which caused damage.\n\nAlong much of the Gulf Coast of Florida, to the north of where Irma made landfall, negative storm surges were observed, with water retracting rather than pushing inland, causing little coastal flooding.However, on the opposite coast, extensive erosion and storm surge flooding occurred in the First Coast, especially in Duval and St. Johns counties.In Duval County, the St. Johns River crested at heights that exceeded records set during Hurricane Dora in 1964.Portions of Jacksonville experienced flooding, particularly the downtown area and the Riverside and San Marco neighborhoods, with about 350 people rescued in those sections of the city.Water reached about high in some homes.The city of Jacksonville suffered about $85 million in damage.\n\nIn St. Johns County, storm surge left extensive damage to oceanfront properties in Ponte Vedra Beach and Vilano Beach, with several becoming uninhabitable.Additionally, some riverfront businesses in St. Augustine\'s historic district were flooded due to storm surge from the Matanzas River.In nearby Clay County, rainfall and storm surge combined to cause extensive flooding along portions of the Black Creek and the St. Johns River, with record high crests at several locations along the former.About 350 people and 75 animals were rescued from floodwaters throughout the county.A total of 275 homes were destroyed, 175 were inflicted major damage, and 124 received minor damage.\n\nThree deaths were reported in Georgia due to falling trees and debris, along with widespread wind damage and power outages throughout the state primarily due to fallen trees.On Tybee Island, as well as St. Simons Island the storm surge caused extensive flooding.The tropical storm also did $54 million in damage in the state.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the third highest storm surge on record was recorded, reaching a height of approximately .By of September 12, almost 100,000 had lost power in Upstate South Carolina.Five people died in storm-related incidents across South Carolina, all from indirect incidents.The tropical storm caused damages totaling $500,000 in the state.\n\nLight damage occurred in other areas, including Tennessee.About 75,000 customers in North Carolina lost power due to Irma.It also caused $600,000 in damages in Alabama.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Irma\'s path through the West Indies and Caribbean, the devastation to roads, harbors and airports significantly impeded the transportation and distribution of relief supplies.Foreign countries moved to provide much of the initial aid.The British, Dutch, French, and United States governments sent warships and planes with supplies and manpower to the region.International leaders, including Dutch King Willem-Alexander and French President Emmanuel Macron, quickly moved to visit affected territories.\n\nSome of the affected countries and territories also offered assistance to each other.Cuba, which sustained extensive damage from the storm, sent 750 health workers to Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, Dominica, and Haiti.Government officials and members of the public in Puerto Rico delivered assistance and evacuated people stranded on other islands.The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services granted special 30-day humanitarian visas for British Virgin Islanders to stay in Puerto Rico.Hundreds of people stranded on Saint Martin were flown to the Dominican Republic on humanitarian grounds.\n\nIn response to Hurricane Jose\'s approach, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a mandatory evacuation on September 9 for any remaining residents on Barbuda.A Miami cargo plane landed on Antigua later that day, carrying over 60 tons (120,000 lbs) of relief supplies for the displaced storm victims—including bottled water, canned food and power generators.\n\nRFA Mounts Bay stationed itself near Anguilla and provided support and relief work to the island with its helicopters and 40 marines and army engineers.The ship delivered 6 tonnes of emergency aid to Anguilla and army engineers repaired a fuel leak at Anguilla\'s main petrol dump, restored power to the island\'s hospital and provided shelters for those left homeless by the hurricane.The ship arrived in the British Virgin Islands on September 8, 2017, to provide emergency relief to the islands, including providing shelters, food and water.HMS Ocean was diverted from the Mediterranean to provide relief from Gibraltar to the affected British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos on September 7, and aid was also supplied by the Department for International Development from their disaster response centre at Kemble Airfield.As part of a £32 million operation named Operation Ruman, nearly 500 UK military personnel with emergency relief were dispatched from RAF Brize Norton.This included the first deployment of No. 38 Expeditionary Air Wing with 3 RAF aircraft; 2 Airbus A400M Atlas and 1 C130J hercules to support relief efforts.\n\nThe British government also drafted 2 members of the UK police calibre into the region on September 10, and 53 police officers were drafted from RAF Brize Norton to the affected British Overseas Territories on September 15 to help maintain order.UK politicians, including the chairs of the foreign affairs and development select committees, criticized both the government\'s preparations for the storm and its response as inadequate.\n\nBy September 12, the Department for International Development had delivered more than 40 tonnes of aid into the region, including into Turks and Caicos, and 1,000 UK military troops were deployed in the region as part of relief efforts.The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, pledged an additional £25 million worth of funding as part of relief efforts in the region on September 13, 2017, and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Boris Johnson, said that a further 250 UK military personnel would be deployed into the area within the next few days.Anguilla\'s Chief Minister, Victor Banks, praised the British government\'s response to the storm and said that Boris Johnson\'s visit to the island ""sends a very positive signal to Anguillans that the British are serious about their response to this very severe hurricane"", but went on to say that the current financial commitment from the UK was not substantial enough.\n\nBy September 15, the United Kingdom had over 70 military personnel and 4 police officers in Anguilla and had delivered 15 tonnes of aid to the island.In the British Virgin Islands, Royal Marines had cleared the airfield so that it was operational for the delivery of aid into the islands, with more than 200 British military personnel and 54 UK police officers on the ground and 8 tonnes of aid delivered to the islands.120 British military personnel were on the ground in Turks and Caicos, and over 150 shelter kits and 720 liters of water were delivered to the islands on September 15.\n\nAmendments to international aid rules by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (or OECD) allowed for the UK government to provide access to £13 billion worth of aid to the affected British Overseas Territories, through the UK\'s Official Development Assistance (ODA) by November 2017.\n\nBy the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage.The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by Irma\'s eye, remained largely inaccessible for days.Assessments showed that 15% of the national telecommunications network had been affected, with at least one tower destroyed.Bahamasair resumed a limited domestic schedule on September 10, with international flights still cancelled due to existing and anticipated destruction at other destinations.\n\nThe worst devastation occurred on Ragged Island, over which Irma\'s eye had directly passed.After days of the National Emergency Management Agency not being able to physically reach the island, officials were finally able to inspect it; they promptly declared it uninhabitable.Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said that it was the worst disaster area he or his officials had ever seen, and that all remaining residents would need to leave, potentially permanently.Business leaders and other officials called for a new long-term development model to shift the population away from such sparsely-settled islands.\n\nOn Grand Bahama and Bimini, where tornadoes associated with Irma touched down on September 10, more than 100 people were left displaced.Infrastructure damage included docks, parks, and the power system.\n\nAside from tangible asset losses, Irma brought significant economic damages.International freight shipping was projected to be offline for a week, and costs for rebuilding supplies were inflated due to demand in the U.S.\n\nSwollen rivers contributed to worsening flooding in the days after the storm system left, resulting in additional evacuations.Officials resorted to using inflatable rafts to access affected areas.The national electrical infrastructure was said to be extensively damaged.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, flooding worsened following Irma\'s departure, leading the number of displaced persons to increase to more than 24,000 by September 8.President Danilo Medina ordered further evacuations due to at-risk dams, while the government banned swimming in rivers and ordered boats kept in port.More than 422,000 people were left without water due to 28 aqueducts being damaged.\n\nIn Haiti, officials stated that losses were greater than they could have been since people largely did not heed early preparation and evacuation warnings.At least 5,000 homes were flooded.One man died trying to cross a flooded river; another went missing and 17 were injured.The trash- and waste-contaminated floodwaters in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives led to fears of cholera outbreaks.Flooding continued to worsen days after the storm, as runoff from the mountains swelled rivers in low-lying farming communities.United Nations peacekeepers from Brazil were able to gain access to the flooded northwest region to provide urgent aid, but non-governmental organizations and Haitian economists warned that the estimated 30,000 victims would need longer-term assistance as well.Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant appointed a government commission to address Irma\'s effects, with Action Against Hunger in charge of humanitarian coordination.\n\nIn the USVI, residents and tourists alike were described as being in a state of traumatic shock.By September 7, the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship had arrived in the USVI to provide supplies, damage assessment, and evacuation assistance.Four additional warships, some of which had already been on their way to Texas to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief, were redirected to the region.At a September 10 news conference, Governor Kenneth Mapp described Irma as a ""horrific disaster"" for which ""[t]here will be no restorations or solutions in days or weeks.""The Federal Emergency Management Agency airlifted in goods for residents, who were subjected to a curfew.Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line agreed to transport tourists to Florida, contingent upon port availability following the state\'s own experience with Irma.\n\nOn Saint John, described as ""perhaps the site of Irma\'s worst devastation on American soil,"" it took six days for an active-theater disaster zone to be established, leading to criticism of the U.S. government response.The National Guard was delayed in reaching Saint John due to the number of overturned boats left in the harbor.The National Guard was brought in to maintain order, while the Coast Guard brought evacuees to cruise ships bound for San Juan and Miami.There was still no electricity on St. John in the middle of October 2017.\n\nBy September 9, more than one million Puerto Ricans were still without power, tens of thousands were without water, and several thousand were still in shelters.Hospitals were operating on generator power.The government was struggling to establish contact with the islands of Culebra and Vieques.By September 10, the main island had recovered enough to serve as a refuge for people stranded on other islands, including 1,200 tourists from Saint Martin and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Airlifts had brought more than 50 patients to Puerto Rico.\n\nFive months after Irma, two-thirds of the hospital beds on Saint Thomas were still unavailable, due to extensive physical damage and staffing shortages.\n\nDamage to Sint Maarten\'s harbour and to Princess Juliana International Airport left the Dutch part of Saint Martin unreachable, although the smaller Grand Case-Espérance Airport on the French side could be reopened by September 7 for supply aid by helicopter and airplane.The French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops on board a CASA/IPTN CN-235 aircraft.\n\nThe following day, the Dutch military was able to airlift dialysis patients off the island while also dropping leaflets to warn islanders about the rapidly approaching Hurricane Jose.Although the airport was closed, 435 students and faculty of the American University of the Caribbean were evacuated by the U.S. military.On September 10, Dutch King Willem-Alexander departed for the region, with intentions to visit Sint Maarten and other affected Dutch territories and commonwealth members.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron followed this announcement by stating his intentions to visit the French part of the island on September 12 in order to bring aid supplies.In response to criticism of the French handling of the disaster, 1,000 troops, police, and other emergency workers were sent to Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.\n\nOn both sides of Saint Martin, desperate conditions combined with food and water shortages in Irma\'s aftermath led to reports of violence, scavenging, and theft.In response, the French government increased its troop deployment to 2,200 and the Dutch government sent more than 600 military and police personnel.\n\nThe day after the hurricane hit Saint Barthelemy the French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops into the reopened Grand Case-Espérance Airport.On September 7 and 9, equipment and personnel were flown from France to Guadeloupe and Martinique.\n\nSporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm.\n\nOn September 11, Florida Governor Rick Scott conducted an aerial tour to survey the damage to the Keys.The Overseas Highway remained closed while authorities assessed the integrity of the 42 bridges along the route.Residents returning to the Keys were faced with a police roadblock, to the south of Florida City.USS Iwo Jima, USS New York and aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were sent to the Keys area to aid with the recovery.\n\nOn September 12, some residents were allowed to return into the Keys as far as Islamorada.Although road damage blocked entry any farther than Islamorada, bridges had been inspected and found safe to Sugarloaf Key.By late on September 12, the Overseas Highway had been repaired and the bridges inspected as safe for first responders to travel to Key West.On September 16, residents were free to return to Marathon.Residents were allowed to return to Key West the following day, although the Keys remained closed to tourists and a checkpoint remained in place in Florida City.\n\nDue mainly to the widespread loss of power, cell phone service was also reduced after battery backup power for cell phone towers ran out and backup generators ran out of fuel.In an impact report by the FCC, as of 11 AM EDT on September 12, 89 of 108 (82%) cell phone towers were non-functioning in Monroe County (Florida Keys), 154 of 212 (73%) were non-functioning in Collier County (Naples), 36 of 46 (78%) were non-functioning in Hendry County, and an additional six counties had 41-60% of cell phone towers not functioning, including Lee County (Fort Myers) and Miami-Dade County.\n\nNOAA released map-format aerial reconnaissance image data of damage from the storm.The imagery featured several areas of Florida: including the Florida Keys, the southwest coast of Florida from Marco Island to Punta Gorda, much of the northeast coast of Florida, and portions of the Jacksonville area.Portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts were also photographed.Additionally, the Sun-Sentinel published before and after photos of several landmarks in the Florida Keys.\n\nIn the days after the hurricane, due to the heavy rainfall, numerous rivers had flooded, including residential areas.Public health risks, such as diarrheal infections and mosquito-borne illnesses, remain from the flooding that resulted in the aftermath of the hurricane.A large concern from flooding is contamination because people become exposed to dirty floodwaters and the potential for contaminated water to enter the local water supply is significant.One example of an illness that can enter the water supply is leptospirosis, which is rat urine carries into the floodwaters.Untreated exposure to leptospirosis can cause kidney damage, meningitis, and liver failure.Noroviruses and other infections are also a risk.\n\nFollowing Irma\'s passage, a hand-carved wooden canoe was discovered on the banks of the Indian River and could be several hundred years old.The state has removed the canoe for examination and safe keeping.\n\nDue to Irma\'s and Hurricane Harvey\'s impact in Florida and Texas, U.S. employment declined in September 2017 for the first time since September 2010.The leisure and hospitality industries were especially hard hit, losing 111,000 jobs in September.\n\nIrma set multiple records for intensity, especially at easterly longitudes, time spent at such an intensity, and its intensity at landfall.When Irma reached Category 5 intensity with winds of at 11:45 UTC on September 5 at 57.7°W, it became the easternmost Atlantic hurricane of this strength on record, surpassing Hurricane David of 1979, later beaten by Hurricane Lorenzo 2 years later.By 00:15 UTC on September 6, Irma reached peak intensity with () winds and a minimum pressure of .This ties it with Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and Hurricane Rita of 2005 as the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed.Only five other Atlantic hurricanes have been recorded with wind speeds higher than Irma: Hurricane Allen of 1980, which had maximum sustained winds of , and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Gilbert of 1988, Hurricane Wilma of 2005, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, all of which had peak winds of .At the time, Irma was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; later surpassed by Hurricane Dorian, and was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007.In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category 5 strength winds, and the third-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, with a value of 64.9 units.Only the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane and Hurricane Ivan in 2004 achieved higher values.\n\nOn September 6, Irma made landfall on the islands of Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Virgin Gorda at peak strength.This ties Irma with cyclones Monica of 2006 and Winston of 2016, and typhoons Zeb of 1998 and Megi of 2010 as the seventh-strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall globally – in terms of sustained winds – trailing only Typhoon Goni of 2020 which bore winds of at landfall, Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 and Typhoon Meranti of 2016, which bore winds of at landfall, and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Typhoon Joan of 1959, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, which bore winds of at landfall.Irma is second to the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin, and is the first hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic at Category 5 status since Felix in 2007.Irma is the first recorded Category 5 hurricane to affect the northern Leeward Islands, and was one of the worst storms to hit the region on record, along with Hurricane Donna in 1960 and Hurricane Luis in 1995.In addition, Irma is only the second hurricane on record to make landfall in Cuba at Category 5 intensity, with the other being a hurricane in 1924.Furthermore, when Irma made landfall on Barbuda, Saint Martin, Virgin Gorda, and Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane, it became one of only two recorded Atlantic storms to make landfall in multiple nations at this strength; the other was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which struck both Eleuthera and the United States as a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nIrma made landfall in the Florida Keys with winds of and a pressure of , making it the strongest hurricane to strike Florida in terms of wind speed since Charley in 2004, and the most intense to strike the state in terms of barometric pressure since Andrew in 1992.In the span of two weeks, two Category 4 hurricanes—Harvey and Irma—struck the continental United States, the first time on record two Atlantic tropical cyclones of such strength made landfall on the country in the same hurricane season.This also marked only the third occurrence of two consecutive Atlantic storms making landfall in the United States as major hurricanes.The other two instances were the Great Charleston and Cheniere Caminada hurricanes in 1893, and hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne in 2004.\n\nBecause of the extensive damage and loss of life the hurricane caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Irma from its rotating naming lists in April 2018, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane.It was replaced with Idalia for the 2023 season.\n\nWeather of 2017 Tropical cyclones in 2017 List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes Operation RUMAN – UK military-civil disaster relief response to Hurricane Irma.List of Cuba hurricanes List

35,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Hurricane Irma', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'Hurricane Irma was an extremely powerful Cape Verde hurricane that caused widespread destruction across its path in early September 2017.Irma was the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the Leeward Islands on record, followed by Maria two weeks later.At the time, it was considered the most powerful hurricane on record in the open Atlantic region, outside of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, until it was surpassed by Hurricane Dorian two years later.It was also the third-strongest Atlantic hurricane at landfall ever recorded, just behind the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane and Dorian.The ninth named storm, fourth hurricane, second major hurricane, and first Category 5 hurricane of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Irma caused widespread and catastrophic damage throughout its long lifetime, particularly in the northeastern Caribbean and the Florida Keys.It was also the most intense hurricane to strike the continental United States since Katrina in 2005, the first major hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Wilma in the same year, and the first Category 4 hurricane to strike the state since Charley in 2004.The word Irmageddon was coined soon after the hurricane to describe the damage caused by the hurricane.\n\nIrma developed from a tropical wave near the Cape Verde Islands on August 30.Favorable conditions allowed Irma to rapidly intensify into a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson wind scale by late on August 31.The storm\'s intensity fluctuated between Categories 2 and 3 for the next several days, due to a series of eyewall replacement cycles.On September 4, Irma resumed intensifying, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by early on the next day.Early on September 6, Irma peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of and a minimum pressure of .Irma was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017 in terms of barometric pressure, and the strongest worldwide in 2017 in terms of wind speed.Another eyewall replacement cycle caused Irma to weaken back to a Category 4 hurricane, but the storm re-attained Category 5 status before making landfall in Cuba.Although Irma briefly weakened to a Category 2 storm while making landfall on Cuba, the system re-intensified to Category 4 status as it crossed the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, before making landfall on Cudjoe Key on September 10.Irma then weakened to Category 3 status, prior to another landfall in Florida on Marco Island later that day.The system degraded into a remnant low over Alabama and ultimately dissipated on September 13 over Missouri.\n\nThe storm caused catastrophic damage in Barbuda, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Anguilla, and the Virgin Islands as a Category 5 hurricane.The hurricane caused at least 134 deaths: one in Anguilla; one in Barbados; three in Barbuda; four in the British Virgin Islands; 10 in Cuba; 11 in the French West Indies; one in Haiti; three in Puerto Rico; four on the Dutch side of Sint Maarten; 92 in the contiguous United States, and four in the U.S. Virgin Islands.Hurricane Irma was the top Google searched term in the U.S. and globally in 2017.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa on August 26.The tropical wave moved off the coast of the continent late on August 27.Throughout the next two days, showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low-pressure area, as the system passed just south of and then through the Cape Verde Islands on August 29.Around 00:00 UTC on the following day, the system developed into a tropical depression just west of the Cape Verde Islands.Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Irma, based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates.With warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, strengthening was anticipated, with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier air.\n\nThe nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow, as an anticyclone became established over the system, with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images.Early on August 31, shortly after the development of a central dense overcast (CDO) and an eye feature, Irma underwent rapid intensification, becoming a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 UTC and then a Category 3 hurricane, becoming a major hurricane – around 00:00 UTC on September 1.Within a 48-hour period, the hurricane\'s intensity had increased by .On September 2, a ship passed to the west of the center of Irma, recording maximum winds of , which indicated that the eye of Irma remained compact.A strong high pressure system to the north of Irma caused the storm to move west-southwestward between September 2 and September 4.The first aircraft reconnaissance mission departed from Barbados on the afternoon of September 3, discovering an eye in diameter and surface winds of .\n\nOn September 4, after moving into more favorable conditions, Irma strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane.As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by 12:00 UTC on the following day, with winds of .The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at near 18:00 UTC on September 5. Irma acquired annular characteristics around this time, with the storm exhibiting a large, symmetric CDO and an impressive satellite appearance.Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern Leeward Islands.Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of Barbuda at peak intensity, with the storm\'s central minimum pressure having bottomed out at – this was the lowest in the Atlantic since Dean in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of .Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15 UTC on Sint Maarten, and at 16:30 UTC on Virgin Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands, though the storm\'s central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall.\n\nAs the hurricane moved away from the Virgin Islands late on September 6, observations from reconnaissance flights, as well as Doppler radar in San Juan, Puerto Rico, indicated an elliptical eye and double eyewalls.Late on September 6, the cyclone passed about north of Puerto Rico.Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of Hispaniola throughout the day on September 7.After beginning an eyewall replacement cycle, Irma weakened to a Category 4 hurricane as it passed south of the Turks and Caicos Islands early on September 8.This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category 5 intensity, the second-longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above – behind only the 1932 Cuba hurricane.At 05:00 UTC on September 8, Irma made landfall on the island of Little Inagua in the Bahamas with sustained winds of .The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a subtropical ridge to its north.Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category 5 intensity at 18:00 UTC that day east of Cuba as deep convection became more pronounced and organized.The hurricane then made landfall in Cayo Romano, Cuba, at 03:00 UTC on September 9, with winds of .This made Irma only the second Category 5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the 1924 Cuba hurricane.As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category 2 storm later on September 9.\n\nAfter slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards Florida around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental United States.Moving over the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, Irma quickly restrengthened to a Category 4 hurricane at 06:00 UTC on September 10, as deep convection improved and the eye became better defined.In addition, Irma\'s wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of and gale-force winds spanning in diameter.The cyclone made landfall in Cudjoe Key, Florida, at 13:00 UTC on September 10, at Category 4 intensity, with winds of .Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category 3 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30 UTC, in Marco Island, Florida, with sustained winds of .Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category 3 intensity hours after landfall.Passing east of Tampa as a weakening Category 1 hurricane around 06:00 UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation – though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds.The system finally weakened to a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC that day as it entered southern Georgia, while acquiring some extratropical characteristics.At 06:00 UTC on September 12, Irma degenerated to a remnant low just as it entered Alabama, as most of the deep convection had diminished.The remnants persisted for another day or so before dissipating over Missouri on September 13.\n\nGiven that Irma\'s forecast track was along much of the Caribbean island chain, hurricane warnings were issued for the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and parts of Hispaniola on September 5.\n\nIn Antigua and Barbuda, residents safeguarded their homes and cleaned up their properties in anticipation of strong winds.Emergency crews were put on standby at public shelters and hospitals by September 5 to assist with any evacuations.Expecting a direct hit, more than half of the residents on Barbuda took shelter, and relief supplies were preemptively mobilized.The National Emergency Management Organization on Saint Lucia urged small craft operators and swimmers to be mindful of forecasts for high surf.Small Craft Warnings and High Surf Advisories were hoisted for Dominica, where residents were urged to remain vigilant of the potential for high waves, landslides, and flooding.\n\nIn Guadeloupe, low-lying and cliff-edge homes were evacuated at the threat of flooding and erosion.Schools and public businesses closed on September 5 and 6.Hospitals stocked up on three days\' worth of supplies and checked the functionality of their generators.Of the island\'s 32 communes, 22 activated their emergency plans; 1,500 people were urged to take shelter.The island sustained relatively minor damage and became the base for relief efforts on Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.Though the core of the hurricane was expected to remain north of the island, a yellow alert was issued for Martinique due to the likelihood of rough seas.The island dispatched relief supplies and military reinforcements to its neighboring islands of Guadeloupe, Saint Martin.and Saint Barthélemy, which faced a greater risk of a direct impact.\n\nOn September 4, Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency.By September 6, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency had deployed response teams in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.Supplies, including food rations, medical supplies, and blankets, were pre-staged in strategic locations on the islands for distribution.\n\nOn September 5, the Dominican Republic activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage; the United States and Haiti followed suit two days later.According to officials, 11,200 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas prior to the storm\'s arrival.Approximately 7,400 tourists were moved to Santo Domingo, away from beach resorts.In Haiti, government officials and aid organizations struggled with early preparation and evacuation efforts.While some officials blamed reluctance and indifference on the part of the population, others ""admitted they were not prepared for the onslaught and no mandatory evacuation orders were in place ahead of Irma\'s approach.""Local officials contended that they had not received promised funds, supplies, or equipment from the national government.The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti prepared its 1,000 peacekeepers and engineers to assist.\n\nIn the Turks and Caicos, evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas starting September 5. Schools were closed, government buildings were boarded up, and shelters were opened.Officials spread warnings to residents in English, Creole, and Spanish via social media, radio, SMS text, and WhatsApp.In The Bahamas, the government began preparations the week prior to the hurricane\'s arrival, including securing national sports facilities to use as shelters.By September 7, the government had evacuated 1,609 people by air from the southern islands, including 365 from Bimini.Controlled cutting of the power supply to southern and central Bahamian islands was conducted in advance of the storm.Shelters were made available, though usage was low due to most evacuees staying with family on other islands.Of the 2,679 foreign tourists still in The Bahamas on September 7, about 1,200 were being housed at Atlantis Paradise Island, one of the most hurricane-ready structures in the country.\n\nIn Cuba, meteorologists did not initially predict a direct hit.Fuel conservation was enacted in Camagüey Province to ensure that enough would be available during post-storm power outages.The Civil Defense evacuated nearly one million people from low-lying areas, including thousands of Canadian and European tourists in the Jardines del Rey.Dolphins at a Cayo Guillermo resort were evacuated by helicopter.\n\nThe NHC issued several watches and warnings for the Southeastern United States.The first watches and warnings were issued at 15:00 UTC on September 7, which was a hurricane watch from the Jupiter Inlet to Bonita Beach, including the Florida Keys and Lake Okeechobee.The watches and warnings were extended into Georgia and South Carolina on September 9.At 21:00 UTC on that day, the advisories reached their maximum extent, with a hurricane warning covering the entire east coast of the state, the west coast from Indian Pass southward, and the Florida Keys; a hurricane watch was in place from the Florida–Georgia state line to Edisto Beach, South Carolina; and there were two tropical storm warnings, one in Florida from Indian Pass to the Okaloosa–Walton county line and the other from the Florida–Georgia state line to the South Santee River in South Carolina.Watches and warnings were gradually discontinued as Irma moved inland and weakened, with all of them canceled by early on September 12.\n\nOn September 4, Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency.Governor Scott placed 100 members of the Florida National Guard on duty to assist in preparations.All 7,000 troops were ordered to be on duty by September 8.Officials advised residents to stock their hurricane kits.The state coordinated with electrical companies in order for power outages to be restored as quickly as possible, extending resources such as equipment, fuel, and lodging for the approximately 24,000 restoration personnel who had been activated.Governor Scott suspended tolls on all toll roads in Florida, including the turnpike.All state offices in Florida were closed from September 8 to September 11, while public schools, state colleges, and state universities in all 67 counties were closed during the same period.The Florida Department of Education coordinated with school districts as the need for transportation by school buses and opening shelters arose.By September 9, more than 150 state parks were closed.Throughout the state, almost 700 emergency shelters were opened.The shelters collectively housed about 191,764 people, with more than 40% of them staying in a shelter in South Florida.Additionally, more than 60 special needs shelters were opened, which housed more than 5,000 people by September 9.\n\nMany airports across the state, particularly in Central and South Florida, were closed.Nearly 9,000 flights intending to arrive in or depart from Florida were canceled.Along Florida\'s coasts, most seaports were closed or opened with restricted access.For the fifth time in its 45-year history, the Walt Disney World Resort was completely closed due to the storm.Its theme parks, water parks, and Disney Springs were all closed by 9:00 p.m. on September 9 and remained closed until September 12.Other Orlando-area theme parks, including Universal Orlando Resort and SeaWorld Orlando, were also closed.The Kennedy Space Center was closed from September 8 to September 15.\n\nAn estimated 6.5 million Floridians were ordered to evacuate, mostly those living on barrier islands or in coastal areas; in mobile or sub-standard homes; and in low-lying or flood prone areas.Mandatory evacuations were ordered for portions of Brevard, Broward, Citrus, Collier, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Glades, Hendry, Hernando, Indian River, Lee, Martin, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Lucie, Sumter, and Volusia counties.All of Monroe County, where the Florida Keys are located, was placed under a mandatory evacuation.Residents in communities near the southern half of Lake Okeechobee were also ordered to leave.Additionally, voluntary evacuation notices were issued for all or parts of Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Charlotte, Columbia, Desoto, Hardee, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lake, Manatee, Okeechobee, Osceola, and Polk counties.\n\nA record 6.5 million Floridians evacuated, making it the largest evacuation in the state\'s history.Evacuees caused significant traffic congestion on northbound Interstate 95, Interstate 75, and Florida\'s Turnpike, exacerbated by the fact that the entire Florida peninsula was within the cone of uncertainty in the NHC\'s forecast path in the days before the storm, so evacuees from both coasts headed north, as evacuees would not be safer by fleeing to the opposite coast.Fuel was in short supply throughout peninsular Florida during the week before Irma\'s arrival, especially along evacuation routes, leading to hours-long lines at fuel stations and even escorts of fuel trucks by the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nUse of the left shoulder as a lane for moving traffic was allowed on northbound Interstate 75 from Wildwood to the Georgia state line beginning September 8 and on eastbound Interstate 4 from Tampa to State Road 429 near Celebration for a few hours on September 9.It was the first time that the shoulder-use plan, which was introduced at the start of the 2017 hurricane season, was implemented by the state for hurricane evacuations.The shoulder-use plan was implemented in place of labor- and resource-intensive contraflow lane reversal, in which both sides of an interstate highway are used for one direction of traffic.\n\nOfficials from the Environmental Protection Agency, which had been criticized for its response to Hurricane Harvey, took special measures to inspect and secure hazardous materials, especially at Superfund sites.Direct Relief, a disaster relief organization, coordinated with local health centers and provided resources to help facilities on the front lines of Floridian and Puerto Rican communities.\n\nGeorgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency initially for all six coastal counties on September 6, but eventually expanded the declaration to 94 counties south of Atlanta metropolitan area, and then the entire state on September 10.Atlanta was placed under its first-ever tropical storm warning.Governor Deal ordered mandatory evacuations for all areas east of Interstate 95 on September 7, before extending the order to the entirety of Chatham County and low-lying areas west of I-95 on the following day.In total, 540,000 people on the Georgia coast were ordered to leave.Contraflow lane reversal for Interstate 16 took effect on the morning of September 9 from Savannah to Dublin, Georgia.All Georgia state parks were open for free to evacuees, as was the 800-acre camping area at Atlanta Motor Speedway.Reversible HOT lanes on Interstate 75 in Georgia through south metro Atlanta were open 24 hours northbound with no tolls.\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on September 6, with South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster following suit the same day.Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency on September 8 in order to protect Virginia residents and to mobilize resources in support of neighboring states.Officials in New Orleans stated that there would not be much time for preparations if Irma failed to make the projected northward turn, but that South Texas or Florida would not be a good evacuation destination.On September 10, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam issued an executive order allowing medical professionals in other states to practice in Tennessee to aid Hurricane Irma evacuees.This order also allowed pharmacies to give out 14-day supplies of medicine, and gave women and children from outside the state the ability to participate in the Tennessee Department of Health programs.Bristol Motor Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway, and Charlotte Motor Speedway all opened their campgrounds to evacuees free of charge.\n\nIn professional sports, the Miami Dolphins–Tampa Bay Buccaneers game scheduled for September 10 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was postponed to November 19 due to the storm\'s threat.The Dolphins left early for their road game against the Los Angeles Chargers.The Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees moved their September 11–13 series from Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg to Citi Field in Queens.Minor League Baseball\'s Florida State League, Carolina League, and Southern League called off their championship finals and as a result, named their division series winners league co-champions.The Miami FC versus San Francisco Deltas match on September 10 was cancelled so the players and staff could prepare for the storm with their families.The Orlando Pride of the National Women\'s Soccer League rescheduled their September 9 match to September 7. Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer did not have any scheduled home games in September, but was unable to return to training facilities in Orlando due to Hurricane Irma.\n\nIn college football, the UCF Knights-Memphis Tigers game scheduled for September 9 was moved to September 30, replacing UCF\'s game against Maine and Memphis game against Georgia State.UCF also cancelled their game against Georgia Tech on September 16, as UCF\'s stadium hosted the National Guard.The USF Bulls-Connecticut Huskies football game was also cancelled.The Miami Hurricanes–Arkansas State Redwolves game scheduled for September 9 at Centennial Bank Stadium in Arkansas was canceled due to travel concerns for the University of Miami.The Florida Gators-Northern Colorado Bears match in Gainesville scheduled for September 9 was cancelled.The Florida State Seminoles contest against the Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks was canceled on September 8.The Seminoles\' rivalry game with the Hurricanes in Tallahassee, originally scheduled for September 16, was postponed tp October 7.The FIU Panthers game against the Alcorn State Braves was moved up a day and relocated to Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.The Georgia Southern Eagles game against the New Hampshire Wildcats on September 9 was also moved to Legion Field for that day.\n\nAs of September 5, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding was running dangerously low, due to its response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas the previous week, prompting the Trump administration to request an immediate $8 billion in additional funding as Irma approached Florida.Given the rate that current funds are being consumed and the catastrophic damage, the United States Senate almost doubled the requested amount to $15.3 billion, with the understanding that this would only be about 10% of what will be required for responding to Harvey.\n\nHurricane Irma\'s path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating, with landfalls in Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Martin, the Bahamas, Cuba, and the United States, all at major hurricane intensity.Furthermore, the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences.Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria.\n\nThe eyewall of the hurricane moved over Barbuda near its record peak intensity early on September 6; a weather station observed a wind gust of .The same station also recorded a minimum barometric pressure of .The exact state of the island remained unclear for hours after Irma\'s passage, as downed phone lines ceased all communication with nearby islands.Later that afternoon, Prime Minister Gaston Browne surveyed the territory by helicopter, revealing an effectively uninhabitable island.Irma damaged or destroyed 95% of the structures on Barbuda, including its hospital, schools, and both of its hotels; it completely flattened some residential blocks while submerging others.The destruction rendered the island\'s sole airport and much of its infrastructure inoperative—including water and telecommunication services—which further hampered relief efforts.Property damage on Barbuda ranged from $150 million to $300 million.A total of three storm-related deaths were reported on the island.\n\nIn addition to the catastrophic impact on Barbuda\'s human residents, concern turned to the storm\'s effects on the island\'s wildlife.The island\'s only endemic bird, the near-threatened Barbuda warbler, numbered less than 2,000 individuals prior to the hurricane.For some time it was unknown if the warbler survived the hurricane or its aftermath; however within a few months it was confirmed that not only did the species survive, but the most of the birds survived the storm.Barbuda\'s Codrington Lagoon, home to the largest colony of magnificent frigatebirds in the Caribbean, with an estimated 2,500 nesting pairs, was also inundated by the storm surge.\n\nRemaining just outside of Irma\'s strongest windfield, Antigua sustained less severe damage, in the form of leveled roofs and fences, downed power poles and lines, and uprooted trees.Some street flooding also took place in low-lying areas.Three people were treated for minor storm-related injuries.Forensic disaster analysts from the Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM), a Germany-based risk management agency, estimate that economic losses for Antigua and Barbuda will exceed $120 million.\n\nOn the morning of September 6, Irma\'s center crossed the island of Saint Martin while the storm was at peak intensity, sweeping away entire structures, submerging roads and cars, and triggering an island-wide blackout.Irma\'s extreme winds ripped trees out of the ground and sent vehicles and debris from damaged structures scattered across the territory.On the French side of Saint-Martin, entire marinas around Marigot were left in ruins, littered with the stranded remnants of boats that had smashed into each other.A hotel caught on fire, but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze.Another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor.Media images depicted devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds had shattered their windows.Irma killed four people on the French side of the island and injured 50 others, one of whom was in critical condition.As many as 95% of the buildings there were damaged to some degree; 60% of those were totally uninhabitable.Estimates from CEDIM indicate a minimum of $950 million worth of economic losses.Total losses exceeded €3.5 billion (US$4.17 billion).\n\nA similar situation unfolded in Sint Maarten, Saint Martin\'s Dutch half, as intense winds ripped through buildings and lifted vehicles aloft ""as if they were matches"".The hurricane wreaked havoc on Princess Juliana International Airport, with ""huge chunks of the building [strewn] across the runway and a jet bridge snapped in half.""It demolished or severely damaged about 70% of Sint Maarten\'s houses, forcing thousands of residents into public shelters.There were 4 deaths and 23 injuries, 11 of which were serious, in the Dutch territory.Irma is considered the worst natural disaster to hit Sint Maarten; the extent of its damage far exceeded that of any previous hurricane.Total damages were estimated at €2.5 billion (US$2.98 billion).\n\nIrma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the French island of Saint Barthélemy, southeast of Saint Martin.Describing the extent of the destruction, one local compared it to ""a bomb that burned all vegetation,"" while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively ""erased the island from the map"".Violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments, with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation.Streets in the capital of Gustavia were turned into rushing rivers, which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture.The island\'s fire station was inundated with up to of flood waters.With scores of homes and much of the infrastructure destroyed, the majority of the island\'s population was left stranded and without water, electricity or phone service.The associated economic losses could exceed $480 million according to CEDIM\'s analysts.\n\nPreliminary assessments from the French government indicate that Hurricane Irma caused a combined €1.2 billion (US$1.43 billion) in insured losses across the French territories of Saint-Martin and Saint Barts.This total covered private property such as homes, vehicles and businesses (including lost revenue); the extent of the damage to infrastructural and public facilities remains undetermined.Nonetheless, this made Irma one of the costliest natural disasters to hit the French Republic in 50 years.\n\nOn January 30, 2018, roughly five months after Irma, an analysis was published indicating that an anemometer on the island recorded an unofficial gust to before failing.\n\nThe British Overseas Territory of Anguilla saw the eyewall of the storm pass over it on September 6.Many homes and schools were destroyed, and the island\'s only hospital was badly damaged.The devastation was particularly severe in East End, where the winds uprooted scores of trees and power poles and demolished a number of houses.In The Valley, the island\'s capital, the hurricane blew out the windows of government buildings.Rough seas inflicted heavy damage upon several bays and harbors, and a seaside restaurant was completely eradicated.About 90% of roads were left impassable.The island\'s air traffic control tower was damaged, exacerbating the already poor communication with the island.One death was reported on the island.Estimates of losses on the island total at least $190 million.\n\nLarge swells ahead of Irma washed ashore debris and sea life in Castries, Saint Lucia, blocking some roads.Seaside roads were inundated with water.One surfer was killed amid rough surf in Barbados after hitting a reef and breaking his neck.Trees were also destroyed.The hurricane\'s effects, such as violent seas and rattling trees, were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in Guadeloupe.Several houses were damaged.Around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm, leaving several communes in the dark without running water.Overall damage was limited to external parts of houses and trees that were blown onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seas.\n\nSaint Kitts and Nevis endured similar conditions to other islands.Blustery rainstorms triggered scattered power outages and disabled the island\'s water system, but per the International Red Cross, the islands were spared the level of destruction seen elsewhere.Still, Prime Minister Timothy Harris stated that property and infrastructure had sustained ""significant damage.""The Dutch territories of Saba and Sint Eustatius were also struck by the hurricane\'s winds, resulting in infrastructural damage, water shortages and telecommunication outages.Several houses were left uninhabitable.On Saba, the hurricane also defoliated trees and injured a few people.CEDIM\'s analysts expect economic losses of $20–65 million for the two islands.\n\nDamage in the British Virgin Islands was extensive.Numerous buildings and roads were destroyed on the island of Tortola, which bore the brunt of the hurricane\'s core.Four people were confirmed dead.Along Cane Garden Bay, the storm surge submerged several seaside bars and a gas station.Satellite images revealed many of the island\'s residential zones had been left in ruins.The hurricane passed over Necker Island, also causing severe damage and destroying the mansion of Richard Branson.\n\nMost homes and businesses were destroyed on the island of Jost Van Dyke, the smallest of the B.V.I.\'s four main islands.The Governor, Gus Jaspert, who had only been sworn into office 13 days previously, declared a state of emergency - the first time this has ever happened in the Territory.After the storm, restoration of electricity took approximately 5 months.\n\nIrma\'s effects in the U.S. Virgin Islands were most profound on Saint Thomas, where at least of rain fell, and on Saint John.Saint Thomas island suffered widespread structural damage, including to its police station and airport.Patients from the fourth and third floors of Charlotte Amalie\'s hospital had to be relocated to lower floors due to flooding from roof leaks.Three deaths were attributed to Irma on the island.On nearby Saint Croix, there were communication issues and some damage to the infrastructure.Saint John lost access to ferry and cargo services, along with access to the local airport.Due to its normal reliance on electricity from Saint Thomas, the island was left without power.Total damage from the three islands was at least $1.1 billion.\n\nThe hurricane passed north of Puerto Rico, but still caused significant damage to the United States territory.Along the coast, a tide gauge observed waves up to mean higher high water.Much of the main island experienced sustained tropical storm force winds, with a peak sustained wind speed of at a weather station along San Juan Bay, while the same site observed a peak wind gust of .However, on the island of Culebra, a wind gust of was reported.Mainly due to strong winds, approximately 1.1 million out of 1.5 million of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority\'s customers lost electricity.Portions of Puerto Rico received heavy rainfall, with a peak total of in Bayamón, causing seven rivers to reach flood stage, widespread flash flooding, and at least six landslides.\n\nThe most severely affected areas included the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques, as well as the northeastern, northern, and mountainous portions of the main island.On Culebra, the island suffered an almost complete loss of electrical and water services.At least 30 homes on the island were destroyed, while about 30 other experienced substantial damage.High winds also toppled a number of trees.The only telecommunications tower on Culebra sustained damage, cutting off outside communications for several hours.In rural Loíza, 79 homes were destroyed.Throughout Puerto Rico, 781 out of 1,600 telecommunications towers went out of commission, primarily due to power outages.At least 362,000 customers lost water services.Debris, mostly fallen trees, blocked at least 72 roads.Approximately 25% to 30% of banana, coffee, papaya, and plantain crops were damaged by strong winds, with losses to farmers estimated at $30.6 million.Approximately 1,530 homes experienced at least moderate damage, with 1,448 homes moderately damaged, 32 extensively damaged, and 50 completely destroyed.\n\nHurricane Irma was attributed to around $1 billion in damage, and the NHC attributed three fatalities to Irma in Puerto Rico, though four deaths were related to the storm.Two people died due to rainstorms ahead of the hurricane: one man died in Orocovis after falling off his ladder while repairing his roof; another man on the coast in Capitanejo died after being struck by lightning.Three nearby fishermen were burned by the same lightning strike, but survived.Two other people died during the hurricane: a woman died while being evacuated from her house in a wheelchair and fell, hitting her head; another person died in a car accident in Canóvanas.Governor Ricardo Rosselló declared the islands of Culebra and Vieques to be disaster areas.\n\nAlthough spared a direct hit, both the Dominican Republic and Haiti were affected by high winds and heavy rains.A bridge over the Dajabón River connecting the two countries was broken.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, the fishing community of Nagua sustained damage from waves that destroyed homes.55,000 soldiers were deployed to affected areas to help with the clean-up efforts.By the evening of September 7, the government had counted 2,721 damaged homes.\n\nIn Haiti, flooding one meter deep sat in residential neighborhoods in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives.Mudslides, destroyed homes, flooded crops, and infrastructure damage were reported in the northern part of the country.The total expanse of the flooding stretched from Môle-Saint-Nicolas in the west to the eastern border with the Dominican Republic.\n\nOn the evening of September 7, at 7:30 pm AST (23:30 UTC), Hurricane Irma reached the Turks and Caicos Islands.While the eye passed just south of the main islands, crossing over South Caicos and the Ambergris Cays, the most powerful winds on the northern side of the eye swept all of the islands for more than two hours.Communications infrastructure was destroyed.\n\nOn September 8, Minister of Infrastructure Goldray Ewing confirmed that damage to Providenciales was extensive, with the northwestern neighborhood of Blue Hill being ""gone"".The hospital in the capital, Cockburn Town, was heavily damaged.On South Caicos, 75% of roofs were lost.Total damage was estimated at over $500 million.\n\nIn the Bahamas, the eye of the storm passed over Duncan Town, the major settlement of the Ragged Islands chain, on September 8.It also passed ""almost directly over"" Inagua and South Acklins, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.\n\nDamages were largely confined to the southern islands starting the morning of September 8.On Mayaguana and Great Inagua, downed power lines knocked out communications.On Great Inagua, 70% of homes sustained roof damage, and the island\'s school lost its roof entirely.The Morton Salt Company\'s signature production facility, one of the major employers in the country, experienced millions of dollars in damages.The Acklins settlement of Salina Point was cut off from the rest of the island by flooding, while Crooked Island had widespread roof damage.In the northern Bahamas, the worst property damage came on September 10 as the outer bands of the system produced tornadic activity on Grand Bahama and Bimini.Damage and losses across The Bahamas amounted to $135 million.\n\nWhile Irma was making landfall in Florida, the ocean was drawn away from some western shorelines of the Bahamas due to strong easterly winds.\n\nEarly on September 9, Irma made landfall on the Camagüey Archipelago off the northern coast of Cuba, with sustained winds of .The strongest official sustained wind speed was , while the highest wind gust reached ; both were observed near Camila in Ciego de Ávila Province.The weather station at Esmeralda, Camagüey, was damaged, with the wind gauge destroyed.The north coast of Cuba experienced significant coastal flooding due to storm surge and abnormally high tides generated by the storm.Wave heights at Cayo Romano exceeded .Storm surge penetrated as far as inland in some areas of Villa Clara Province.Multiple locations on the island observed at least of rainfall, with a peak total of of precipitation at Topes de Collantes.\n\nA total of 158,554 homes experienced some degree of damage, of which 14,657 were destroyed; approximately 1.9 million people experienced the direct effects of Irma.The storm partially deroofed 103,691 homes, while 23,560 were completely deroofed.Irma damaged or destroyed 980 health facilities and 2,264 schools.Approximately 3.1 million people experienced disruptions to the water supply, while 246,707 people lost telephone service.About of roads were damaged.Crops also suffered extensively, with nearly affected by the storm.Throughout the country, the hurricane inflicted $13.185 billion in damage and killed 10 people, making Irma the costliest tropical cyclone in Cuban history.\n\nThe tourist areas of Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and Cayo Santa María and the nearby town of Caibarién received the brunt of the storm, with waves rolling through town and the characteristic one-story homes completely flooded.The storm most severely Ciego de Ávila and Villa Clara provinces.Flooding worsened as the hurricane moved west, pushing the storm surge along to the regions around Havana.By the afternoon, limited flooding was occurring in Havana, including around the Malecón.Portions of province coastal flooding surpassing that which was experienced during the Storm of the Century in 1993 and Hurricane Wilma in 2005.In the city of Santa Clara, 39 buildings collapsed.Rainfall resulted in several rivers reaching major flood stage.The town of Cabaiguán in Sancti Spíritus Province in particular suffered extensive inland flooding after the Zaza River swelled.\n\nHurricane Irma directly affected a major colony of American flamingos on Cuba\'s northern Cayo Coco.Early reports from Diario de Cuba indicated that several hundred flamingos had been killed by the storm, though other estimates ranged as high as several thousand birds.\n\nHurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida.Except for the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned.Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba, but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys.The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States.After surveying the aftermath of Irma, Florida governor Rick Scott said ""I thought we would see more damage""[on the mainland] but said ""he witnessed devastation in the Keys"".President Donald Trump commented on Twitter that the devastation in some places was ""far greater than anyone thought"".\n\nDamage in the United States was estimated at a minimum of $50 billion.At the time, Irma was the fourth costliest tropical cyclone in the United States, behind hurricanes Sandy in 2012, Harvey earlier that year, and Katrina in 2005.However, later in September 2017, Hurricane Maria became the third costliest United States tropical cyclone, causing Irma to fall to the fifth costliest.At least 92 people, 10 directly and 82 indirectly, died throughout the United States in relation to Irma: 84 in Florida, 3 in Georgia, 3 in South Carolina, and 2 in North Carolina.\n\nIrma struck the state less than two weeks after Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten had caused the worst flooding seen in western Florida in 20 years, which further worsened the impacts in the region.The storm\'s large wind field resulted in strong winds across much of Florida, except for the western Panhandle.The highest reported sustained wind speed was on Marco Island, while the strongest observed wind gust was , recorded near Naples, though wind gusts of likely occurred in the Middle Florida Keys.More than 7.7 million homes and businesses in Florida were left without electricity at some point – approximately 73% of state.Generally heavy amounts of rainfall were recorded to the east of the Irma\'s path, including a peak total of in Fort Pierce.Heavy precipitation – and storm surge, in some instances – overflowed at least 32 rivers and creeks, causing significant flooding, particularly along the St. Johns River and its tributaries.Many homes and businesses suffered damage or destruction, with more than 65,000 structures damaged to some degree in West Central and Southwest Florida alone.Agriculture experienced about $2.5 billion in damage.It was estimated that the cyclone caused at least $50 billion in damage, making Irma the costliest hurricane in Florida history, surpassing Hurricane Andrew, until it was itself surpassed by Hurricane Ian, 5 years later.\n\nThroughout Florida, at least 84 people died in storm-related incidents.About half of the deaths occurred from drowning, trauma, and carbon monoxide poisoning.Broward County had 21 fatalities, the most of any county in Florida.Among those deaths were 12 people at The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, a Hollywood nursing home.The patients died from sweltering heat worsened by the lack of air conditioning.The hurricane also left at least 14 deaths in Monroe County; 6 deaths in Orange County; 5 deaths each in Duval, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties; 4 deaths in both Highlands and Hillsborough counties; 3 deaths in both Marion and Polk counties; 2 deaths each in Collier, Hardee, Leon, Pinellas, St. Lucie, and Taylor counties; and 1 death in Hendry, Lake, Lee, Liberty, Manatee, Nassau, Okeechobee, Pasco, Seminole, St. Johns, and Volusia counties.\n\nWith Irma making landfall in Monroe County as a Category 4 hurricane, the Florida Keys were hardest hit area in the state.Strong winds and storm surge flooding caused major damage to buildings, trailer parks, boats, roads, the electricity supply, mobile phone coverage, internet access, sanitation, the water supply and the fuel supply throughout the island chain.An estimated storm surge occurred at Cudjoe Key, where Irma made landfall.Throughout the island, 625 homes sustained minor damage, 52 sustained major damage, and 81 were demolished.On Big Pine Key, one of the most devastated islands, 633 homes received minor impact, 299 homes received major impact, and 473 homes were completely destroyed.Overall in Monroe County, 27,649 homes experienced some degree of damage, including 1,179 homes being destroyed, 2,977 homes receiving major damage, and 5,361 suffering minor damage.\n\nAfter devastating the Keys, the storm then struck Collier County as a Category 3 hurricane.Several communities in the county suffered extensive damage, especially along the coast.Throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, 65 homes, including 44 mobile homes, were demolished, while 1,008 homes received major damage.Property damages in unincorporated areas alone reach about $320 million.Lee County was lashed by strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused prolonged flooding in some areas.More than 24,000 homes suffered some degree of damage, with almost 3,000 homes receiving major damage and 89 homes being destroyed.Damage in the county totaled about $857 million.\n\nImpact in much of the Miami metropolitan area was generally limited to extensive tree and fence damage, as well as widespread power outages.However, in Miami-Dade County, about 1,000 homes received major damage and about 50% of crops were lost.Storm surge caused coastal flooding from Homestead to Downtown Miami, as well as in portions of Miami Beach.Parts of the Florida Heartland were devastated by high winds and flooding, particularly Hendry and Highlands counties.In the former, which has most citrus trees of any county in Florida, about 60% of orange crops were lost.Throughout Hendry County, a total of 451 homes had minor damage, 131 homes suffered major damage, and 42 others were destroyed.In Highlands County, 13,138 businesses and homes were damaged to some degree, with 144 being destroyed, 963 sustaining major damage, and 2,408 receiving minor damage.In Orange County, wind gusts reached 79 mph at Orlando International Airport.A wind gust of 91 mph was also recorded in Orlando at the top of the Disney Contemporary Resort.Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central Florida left some wind damage and flooding, necessitating evacuations and rescues, including more than 200 people in Orlo Vista after hundreds of homes were flooded.A total of 2,999 business or homes were damaged in Lake County, 7,430 in Seminole County, and 3,457 in Volusia County.Additionally, eight tornadoes touched down in Brevard County, all of which caused damage.\n\nAlong much of the Gulf Coast of Florida, to the north of where Irma made landfall, negative storm surges were observed, with water retracting rather than pushing inland, causing little coastal flooding.However, on the opposite coast, extensive erosion and storm surge flooding occurred in the First Coast, especially in Duval and St. Johns counties.In Duval County, the St. Johns River crested at heights that exceeded records set during Hurricane Dora in 1964.Portions of Jacksonville experienced flooding, particularly the downtown area and the Riverside and San Marco neighborhoods, with about 350 people rescued in those sections of the city.Water reached about high in some homes.The city of Jacksonville suffered about $85 million in damage.\n\nIn St. Johns County, storm surge left extensive damage to oceanfront properties in Ponte Vedra Beach and Vilano Beach, with several becoming uninhabitable.Additionally, some riverfront businesses in St. Augustine\'s historic district were flooded due to storm surge from the Matanzas River.In nearby Clay County, rainfall and storm surge combined to cause extensive flooding along portions of the Black Creek and the St. Johns River, with record high crests at several locations along the former.About 350 people and 75 animals were rescued from floodwaters throughout the county.A total of 275 homes were destroyed, 175 were inflicted major damage, and 124 received minor damage.\n\nThree deaths were reported in Georgia due to falling trees and debris, along with widespread wind damage and power outages throughout the state primarily due to fallen trees.On Tybee Island, as well as St. Simons Island the storm surge caused extensive flooding.The tropical storm also did $54 million in damage in the state.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the third highest storm surge on record was recorded, reaching a height of approximately .By of September 12, almost 100,000 had lost power in Upstate South Carolina.Five people died in storm-related incidents across South Carolina, all from indirect incidents.The tropical storm caused damages totaling $500,000 in the state.\n\nLight damage occurred in other areas, including Tennessee.About 75,000 customers in North Carolina lost power due to Irma.It also caused $600,000 in damages in Alabama.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Irma\'s path through the West Indies and Caribbean, the devastation to roads, harbors and airports significantly impeded the transportation and distribution of relief supplies.Foreign countries moved to provide much of the initial aid.The British, Dutch, French, and United States governments sent warships and planes with supplies and manpower to the region.International leaders, including Dutch King Willem-Alexander and French President Emmanuel Macron, quickly moved to visit affected territories.\n\nSome of the affected countries and territories also offered assistance to each other.Cuba, which sustained extensive damage from the storm, sent 750 health workers to Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, Dominica, and Haiti.Government officials and members of the public in Puerto Rico delivered assistance and evacuated people stranded on other islands.The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services granted special 30-day humanitarian visas for British Virgin Islanders to stay in Puerto Rico.Hundreds of people stranded on Saint Martin were flown to the Dominican Republic on humanitarian grounds.\n\nIn response to Hurricane Jose\'s approach, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a mandatory evacuation on September 9 for any remaining residents on Barbuda.A Miami cargo plane landed on Antigua later that day, carrying over 60 tons (120,000 lbs) of relief supplies for the displaced storm victims—including bottled water, canned food and power generators.\n\nRFA Mounts Bay stationed itself near Anguilla and provided support and relief work to the island with its helicopters and 40 marines and army engineers.The ship delivered 6 tonnes of emergency aid to Anguilla and army engineers repaired a fuel leak at Anguilla\'s main petrol dump, restored power to the island\'s hospital and provided shelters for those left homeless by the hurricane.The ship arrived in the British Virgin Islands on September 8, 2017, to provide emergency relief to the islands, including providing shelters, food and water.HMS Ocean was diverted from the Mediterranean to provide relief from Gibraltar to the affected British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos on September 7, and aid was also supplied by the Department for International Development from their disaster response centre at Kemble Airfield.As part of a £32 million operation named Operation Ruman, nearly 500 UK military personnel with emergency relief were dispatched from RAF Brize Norton.This included the first deployment of No. 38 Expeditionary Air Wing with 3 RAF aircraft; 2 Airbus A400M Atlas and 1 C130J hercules to support relief efforts.\n\nThe British government also drafted 2 members of the UK police calibre into the region on September 10, and 53 police officers were drafted from RAF Brize Norton to the affected British Overseas Territories on September 15 to help maintain order.UK politicians, including the chairs of the foreign affairs and development select committees, criticized both the government\'s preparations for the storm and its response as inadequate.\n\nBy September 12, the Department for International Development had delivered more than 40 tonnes of aid into the region, including into Turks and Caicos, and 1,000 UK military troops were deployed in the region as part of relief efforts.The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, pledged an additional £25 million worth of funding as part of relief efforts in the region on September 13, 2017, and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Boris Johnson, said that a further 250 UK military personnel would be deployed into the area within the next few days.Anguilla\'s Chief Minister, Victor Banks, praised the British government\'s response to the storm and said that Boris Johnson\'s visit to the island ""sends a very positive signal to Anguillans that the British are serious about their response to this very severe hurricane"", but went on to say that the current financial commitment from the UK was not substantial enough.\n\nBy September 15, the United Kingdom had over 70 military personnel and 4 police officers in Anguilla and had delivered 15 tonnes of aid to the island.In the British Virgin Islands, Royal Marines had cleared the airfield so that it was operational for the delivery of aid into the islands, with more than 200 British military personnel and 54 UK police officers on the ground and 8 tonnes of aid delivered to the islands.120 British military personnel were on the ground in Turks and Caicos, and over 150 shelter kits and 720 liters of water were delivered to the islands on September 15.\n\nAmendments to international aid rules by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (or OECD) allowed for the UK government to provide access to £13 billion worth of aid to the affected British Overseas Territories, through the UK\'s Official Development Assistance (ODA) by November 2017.\n\nBy the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage.The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by Irma\'s eye, remained largely inaccessible for days.Assessments showed that 15% of the national telecommunications network had been affected, with at least one tower destroyed.Bahamasair resumed a limited domestic schedule on September 10, with international flights still cancelled due to existing and anticipated destruction at other destinations.\n\nThe worst devastation occurred on Ragged Island, over which Irma\'s eye had directly passed.After days of the National Emergency Management Agency not being able to physically reach the island, officials were finally able to inspect it; they promptly declared it uninhabitable.Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said that it was the worst disaster area he or his officials had ever seen, and that all remaining residents would need to leave, potentially permanently.Business leaders and other officials called for a new long-term development model to shift the population away from such sparsely-settled islands.\n\nOn Grand Bahama and Bimini, where tornadoes associated with Irma touched down on September 10, more than 100 people were left displaced.Infrastructure damage included docks, parks, and the power system.\n\nAside from tangible asset losses, Irma brought significant economic damages.International freight shipping was projected to be offline for a week, and costs for rebuilding supplies were inflated due to demand in the U.S.\n\nSwollen rivers contributed to worsening flooding in the days after the storm system left, resulting in additional evacuations.Officials resorted to using inflatable rafts to access affected areas.The national electrical infrastructure was said to be extensively damaged.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, flooding worsened following Irma\'s departure, leading the number of displaced persons to increase to more than 24,000 by September 8.President Danilo Medina ordered further evacuations due to at-risk dams, while the government banned swimming in rivers and ordered boats kept in port.More than 422,000 people were left without water due to 28 aqueducts being damaged.\n\nIn Haiti, officials stated that losses were greater than they could have been since people largely did not heed early preparation and evacuation warnings.At least 5,000 homes were flooded.One man died trying to cross a flooded river; another went missing and 17 were injured.The trash- and waste-contaminated floodwaters in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives led to fears of cholera outbreaks.Flooding continued to worsen days after the storm, as runoff from the mountains swelled rivers in low-lying farming communities.United Nations peacekeepers from Brazil were able to gain access to the flooded northwest region to provide urgent aid, but non-governmental organizations and Haitian economists warned that the estimated 30,000 victims would need longer-term assistance as well.Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant appointed a government commission to address Irma\'s effects, with Action Against Hunger in charge of humanitarian coordination.\n\nIn the USVI, residents and tourists alike were described as being in a state of traumatic shock.By September 7, the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship had arrived in the USVI to provide supplies, damage assessment, and evacuation assistance.Four additional warships, some of which had already been on their way to Texas to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief, were redirected to the region.At a September 10 news conference, Governor Kenneth Mapp described Irma as a ""horrific disaster"" for which ""[t]here will be no restorations or solutions in days or weeks.""The Federal Emergency Management Agency airlifted in goods for residents, who were subjected to a curfew.Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line agreed to transport tourists to Florida, contingent upon port availability following the state\'s own experience with Irma.\n\nOn Saint John, described as ""perhaps the site of Irma\'s worst devastation on American soil,"" it took six days for an active-theater disaster zone to be established, leading to criticism of the U.S. government response.The National Guard was delayed in reaching Saint John due to the number of overturned boats left in the harbor.The National Guard was brought in to maintain order, while the Coast Guard brought evacuees to cruise ships bound for San Juan and Miami.There was still no electricity on St. John in the middle of October 2017.\n\nBy September 9, more than one million Puerto Ricans were still without power, tens of thousands were without water, and several thousand were still in shelters.Hospitals were operating on generator power.The government was struggling to establish contact with the islands of Culebra and Vieques.By September 10, the main island had recovered enough to serve as a refuge for people stranded on other islands, including 1,200 tourists from Saint Martin and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Airlifts had brought more than 50 patients to Puerto Rico.\n\nFive months after Irma, two-thirds of the hospital beds on Saint Thomas were still unavailable, due to extensive physical damage and staffing shortages.\n\nDamage to Sint Maarten\'s harbour and to Princess Juliana International Airport left the Dutch part of Saint Martin unreachable, although the smaller Grand Case-Espérance Airport on the French side could be reopened by September 7 for supply aid by helicopter and airplane.The French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops on board a CASA/IPTN CN-235 aircraft.\n\nThe following day, the Dutch military was able to airlift dialysis patients off the island while also dropping leaflets to warn islanders about the rapidly approaching Hurricane Jose.Although the airport was closed, 435 students and faculty of the American University of the Caribbean were evacuated by the U.S. military.On September 10, Dutch King Willem-Alexander departed for the region, with intentions to visit Sint Maarten and other affected Dutch territories and commonwealth members.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron followed this announcement by stating his intentions to visit the French part of the island on September 12 in order to bring aid supplies.In response to criticism of the French handling of the disaster, 1,000 troops, police, and other emergency workers were sent to Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.\n\nOn both sides of Saint Martin, desperate conditions combined with food and water shortages in Irma\'s aftermath led to reports of violence, scavenging, and theft.In response, the French government increased its troop deployment to 2,200 and the Dutch government sent more than 600 military and police personnel.\n\nThe day after the hurricane hit Saint Barthelemy the French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops into the reopened Grand Case-Espérance Airport.On September 7 and 9, equipment and personnel were flown from France to Guadeloupe and Martinique.\n\nSporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm.\n\nOn September 11, Florida Governor Rick Scott conducted an aerial tour to survey the damage to the Keys.The Overseas Highway remained closed while authorities assessed the integrity of the 42 bridges along the route.Residents returning to the Keys were faced with a police roadblock, to the south of Florida City.USS Iwo Jima, USS New York and aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were sent to the Keys area to aid with the recovery.\n\nOn September 12, some residents were allowed to return into the Keys as far as Islamorada.Although road damage blocked entry any farther than Islamorada, bridges had been inspected and found safe to Sugarloaf Key.By late on September 12, the Overseas Highway had been repaired and the bridges inspected as safe for first responders to travel to Key West.On September 16, residents were free to return to Marathon.Residents were allowed to return to Key West the following day, although the Keys remained closed to tourists and a checkpoint remained in place in Florida City.\n\nDue mainly to the widespread loss of power, cell phone service was also reduced after battery backup power for cell phone towers ran out and backup generators ran out of fuel.In an impact report by the FCC, as of 11 AM EDT on September 12, 89 of 108 (82%) cell phone towers were non-functioning in Monroe County (Florida Keys), 154 of 212 (73%) were non-functioning in Collier County (Naples), 36 of 46 (78%) were non-functioning in Hendry County, and an additional six counties had 41-60% of cell phone towers not functioning, including Lee County (Fort Myers) and Miami-Dade County.\n\nNOAA released map-format aerial reconnaissance image data of damage from the storm.The imagery featured several areas of Florida: including the Florida Keys, the southwest coast of Florida from Marco Island to Punta Gorda, much of the northeast coast of Florida, and portions of the Jacksonville area.Portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts were also photographed.Additionally, the Sun-Sentinel published before and after photos of several landmarks in the Florida Keys.\n\nIn the days after the hurricane, due to the heavy rainfall, numerous rivers had flooded, including residential areas.Public health risks, such as diarrheal infections and mosquito-borne illnesses, remain from the flooding that resulted in the aftermath of the hurricane.A large concern from flooding is contamination because people become exposed to dirty floodwaters and the potential for contaminated water to enter the local water supply is significant.One example of an illness that can enter the water supply is leptospirosis, which is rat urine carries into the floodwaters.Untreated exposure to leptospirosis can cause kidney damage, meningitis, and liver failure.Noroviruses and other infections are also a risk.\n\nFollowing Irma\'s passage, a hand-carved wooden canoe was discovered on the banks of the Indian River and could be several hundred years old.The state has removed the canoe for examination and safe keeping.\n\nDue to Irma\'s and Hurricane Harvey\'s impact in Florida and Texas, U.S. employment declined in September 2017 for the first time since September 2010.The leisure and hospitality industries were especially hard hit, losing 111,000 jobs in September.\n\nIrma set multiple records for intensity, especially at easterly longitudes, time spent at such an intensity, and its intensity at landfall.When Irma reached Category 5 intensity with winds of at 11:45 UTC on September 5 at 57.7°W, it became the easternmost Atlantic hurricane of this strength on record, surpassing Hurricane David of 1979, later beaten by Hurricane Lorenzo 2 years later.By 00:15 UTC on September 6, Irma reached peak intensity with () winds and a minimum pressure of .This ties it with Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and Hurricane Rita of 2005 as the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed.Only five other Atlantic hurricanes have been recorded with wind speeds higher than Irma: Hurricane Allen of 1980, which had maximum sustained winds of , and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Gilbert of 1988, Hurricane Wilma of 2005, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, all of which had peak winds of .At the time, Irma was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; later surpassed by Hurricane Dorian, and was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007.In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category 5 strength winds, and the third-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, with a value of 64.9 units.Only the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane and Hurricane Ivan in 2004 achieved higher values.\n\nOn September 6, Irma made landfall on the islands of Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Virgin Gorda at peak strength.This ties Irma with cyclones Monica of 2006 and Winston of 2016, and typhoons Zeb of 1998 and Megi of 2010 as the seventh-strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall globally – in terms of sustained winds – trailing only Typhoon Goni of 2020 which bore winds of at landfall, Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 and Typhoon Meranti of 2016, which bore winds of at landfall, and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Typhoon Joan of 1959, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, which bore winds of at landfall.Irma is second to the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin, and is the first hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic at Category 5 status since Felix in 2007.Irma is the first recorded Category 5 hurricane to affect the northern Leeward Islands, and was one of the worst storms to hit the region on record, along with Hurricane Donna in 1960 and Hurricane Luis in 1995.In addition, Irma is only the second hurricane on record to make landfall in Cuba at Category 5 intensity, with the other being a hurricane in 1924.Furthermore, when Irma made landfall on Barbuda, Saint Martin, Virgin Gorda, and Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane, it became one of only two recorded Atlantic storms to make landfall in multiple nations at this strength; the other was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which struck both Eleuthera and the United States as a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nIrma made landfall in the Florida Keys with winds of and a pressure of , making it the strongest hurricane to strike Florida in terms of wind speed since Charley in 2004, and the most intense to strike the state in terms of barometric pressure since Andrew in 1992.In the span of two weeks, two Category 4 hurricanes—Harvey and Irma—struck the continental United States, the first time on record two Atlantic tropical cyclones of such strength made landfall on the country in the same hurricane season.This also marked only the third occurrence of two consecutive Atlantic storms making landfall in the United States as major hurricanes.The other two instances were the Great Charleston and Cheniere Caminada hurricanes in 1893, and hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne in 2004.\n\nBecause of the extensive damage and loss of life the hurricane caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Irma from its rotating naming lists in April 2018, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane.It was replaced with Idalia for the 2023 season.\n\nWeather of 2017 Tropical cyclones in 2017 List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes Operation RUMAN – UK military-civil disaster relief response to Hurricane Irma.List of Cuba hurricanes List

36,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Hurricane Irma', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'Hurricane Irma was an extremely powerful Cape Verde hurricane that caused widespread destruction across its path in early September 2017.Irma was the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the Leeward Islands on record, followed by Maria two weeks later.At the time, it was considered the most powerful hurricane on record in the open Atlantic region, outside of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, until it was surpassed by Hurricane Dorian two years later.It was also the third-strongest Atlantic hurricane at landfall ever recorded, just behind the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane and Dorian.The ninth named storm, fourth hurricane, second major hurricane, and first Category 5 hurricane of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Irma caused widespread and catastrophic damage throughout its long lifetime, particularly in the northeastern Caribbean and the Florida Keys.It was also the most intense hurricane to strike the continental United States since Katrina in 2005, the first major hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Wilma in the same year, and the first Category 4 hurricane to strike the state since Charley in 2004.The word Irmageddon was coined soon after the hurricane to describe the damage caused by the hurricane.\n\nIrma developed from a tropical wave near the Cape Verde Islands on August 30.Favorable conditions allowed Irma to rapidly intensify into a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson wind scale by late on August 31.The storm\'s intensity fluctuated between Categories 2 and 3 for the next several days, due to a series of eyewall replacement cycles.On September 4, Irma resumed intensifying, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by early on the next day.Early on September 6, Irma peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of and a minimum pressure of .Irma was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017 in terms of barometric pressure, and the strongest worldwide in 2017 in terms of wind speed.Another eyewall replacement cycle caused Irma to weaken back to a Category 4 hurricane, but the storm re-attained Category 5 status before making landfall in Cuba.Although Irma briefly weakened to a Category 2 storm while making landfall on Cuba, the system re-intensified to Category 4 status as it crossed the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, before making landfall on Cudjoe Key on September 10.Irma then weakened to Category 3 status, prior to another landfall in Florida on Marco Island later that day.The system degraded into a remnant low over Alabama and ultimately dissipated on September 13 over Missouri.\n\nThe storm caused catastrophic damage in Barbuda, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Anguilla, and the Virgin Islands as a Category 5 hurricane.The hurricane caused at least 134 deaths: one in Anguilla; one in Barbados; three in Barbuda; four in the British Virgin Islands; 10 in Cuba; 11 in the French West Indies; one in Haiti; three in Puerto Rico; four on the Dutch side of Sint Maarten; 92 in the contiguous United States, and four in the U.S. Virgin Islands.Hurricane Irma was the top Google searched term in the U.S. and globally in 2017.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa on August 26.The tropical wave moved off the coast of the continent late on August 27.Throughout the next two days, showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low-pressure area, as the system passed just south of and then through the Cape Verde Islands on August 29.Around 00:00 UTC on the following day, the system developed into a tropical depression just west of the Cape Verde Islands.Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Irma, based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates.With warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, strengthening was anticipated, with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier air.\n\nThe nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow, as an anticyclone became established over the system, with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images.Early on August 31, shortly after the development of a central dense overcast (CDO) and an eye feature, Irma underwent rapid intensification, becoming a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 UTC and then a Category 3 hurricane, becoming a major hurricane – around 00:00 UTC on September 1.Within a 48-hour period, the hurricane\'s intensity had increased by .On September 2, a ship passed to the west of the center of Irma, recording maximum winds of , which indicated that the eye of Irma remained compact.A strong high pressure system to the north of Irma caused the storm to move west-southwestward between September 2 and September 4.The first aircraft reconnaissance mission departed from Barbados on the afternoon of September 3, discovering an eye in diameter and surface winds of .\n\nOn September 4, after moving into more favorable conditions, Irma strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane.As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by 12:00 UTC on the following day, with winds of .The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at near 18:00 UTC on September 5. Irma acquired annular characteristics around this time, with the storm exhibiting a large, symmetric CDO and an impressive satellite appearance.Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern Leeward Islands.Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of Barbuda at peak intensity, with the storm\'s central minimum pressure having bottomed out at – this was the lowest in the Atlantic since Dean in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of .Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15 UTC on Sint Maarten, and at 16:30 UTC on Virgin Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands, though the storm\'s central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall.\n\nAs the hurricane moved away from the Virgin Islands late on September 6, observations from reconnaissance flights, as well as Doppler radar in San Juan, Puerto Rico, indicated an elliptical eye and double eyewalls.Late on September 6, the cyclone passed about north of Puerto Rico.Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of Hispaniola throughout the day on September 7.After beginning an eyewall replacement cycle, Irma weakened to a Category 4 hurricane as it passed south of the Turks and Caicos Islands early on September 8.This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category 5 intensity, the second-longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above – behind only the 1932 Cuba hurricane.At 05:00 UTC on September 8, Irma made landfall on the island of Little Inagua in the Bahamas with sustained winds of .The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a subtropical ridge to its north.Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category 5 intensity at 18:00 UTC that day east of Cuba as deep convection became more pronounced and organized.The hurricane then made landfall in Cayo Romano, Cuba, at 03:00 UTC on September 9, with winds of .This made Irma only the second Category 5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the 1924 Cuba hurricane.As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category 2 storm later on September 9.\n\nAfter slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards Florida around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental United States.Moving over the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, Irma quickly restrengthened to a Category 4 hurricane at 06:00 UTC on September 10, as deep convection improved and the eye became better defined.In addition, Irma\'s wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of and gale-force winds spanning in diameter.The cyclone made landfall in Cudjoe Key, Florida, at 13:00 UTC on September 10, at Category 4 intensity, with winds of .Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category 3 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30 UTC, in Marco Island, Florida, with sustained winds of .Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category 3 intensity hours after landfall.Passing east of Tampa as a weakening Category 1 hurricane around 06:00 UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation – though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds.The system finally weakened to a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC that day as it entered southern Georgia, while acquiring some extratropical characteristics.At 06:00 UTC on September 12, Irma degenerated to a remnant low just as it entered Alabama, as most of the deep convection had diminished.The remnants persisted for another day or so before dissipating over Missouri on September 13.\n\nGiven that Irma\'s forecast track was along much of the Caribbean island chain, hurricane warnings were issued for the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and parts of Hispaniola on September 5.\n\nIn Antigua and Barbuda, residents safeguarded their homes and cleaned up their properties in anticipation of strong winds.Emergency crews were put on standby at public shelters and hospitals by September 5 to assist with any evacuations.Expecting a direct hit, more than half of the residents on Barbuda took shelter, and relief supplies were preemptively mobilized.The National Emergency Management Organization on Saint Lucia urged small craft operators and swimmers to be mindful of forecasts for high surf.Small Craft Warnings and High Surf Advisories were hoisted for Dominica, where residents were urged to remain vigilant of the potential for high waves, landslides, and flooding.\n\nIn Guadeloupe, low-lying and cliff-edge homes were evacuated at the threat of flooding and erosion.Schools and public businesses closed on September 5 and 6.Hospitals stocked up on three days\' worth of supplies and checked the functionality of their generators.Of the island\'s 32 communes, 22 activated their emergency plans; 1,500 people were urged to take shelter.The island sustained relatively minor damage and became the base for relief efforts on Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.Though the core of the hurricane was expected to remain north of the island, a yellow alert was issued for Martinique due to the likelihood of rough seas.The island dispatched relief supplies and military reinforcements to its neighboring islands of Guadeloupe, Saint Martin.and Saint Barthélemy, which faced a greater risk of a direct impact.\n\nOn September 4, Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency.By September 6, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency had deployed response teams in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.Supplies, including food rations, medical supplies, and blankets, were pre-staged in strategic locations on the islands for distribution.\n\nOn September 5, the Dominican Republic activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage; the United States and Haiti followed suit two days later.According to officials, 11,200 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas prior to the storm\'s arrival.Approximately 7,400 tourists were moved to Santo Domingo, away from beach resorts.In Haiti, government officials and aid organizations struggled with early preparation and evacuation efforts.While some officials blamed reluctance and indifference on the part of the population, others ""admitted they were not prepared for the onslaught and no mandatory evacuation orders were in place ahead of Irma\'s approach.""Local officials contended that they had not received promised funds, supplies, or equipment from the national government.The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti prepared its 1,000 peacekeepers and engineers to assist.\n\nIn the Turks and Caicos, evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas starting September 5. Schools were closed, government buildings were boarded up, and shelters were opened.Officials spread warnings to residents in English, Creole, and Spanish via social media, radio, SMS text, and WhatsApp.In The Bahamas, the government began preparations the week prior to the hurricane\'s arrival, including securing national sports facilities to use as shelters.By September 7, the government had evacuated 1,609 people by air from the southern islands, including 365 from Bimini.Controlled cutting of the power supply to southern and central Bahamian islands was conducted in advance of the storm.Shelters were made available, though usage was low due to most evacuees staying with family on other islands.Of the 2,679 foreign tourists still in The Bahamas on September 7, about 1,200 were being housed at Atlantis Paradise Island, one of the most hurricane-ready structures in the country.\n\nIn Cuba, meteorologists did not initially predict a direct hit.Fuel conservation was enacted in Camagüey Province to ensure that enough would be available during post-storm power outages.The Civil Defense evacuated nearly one million people from low-lying areas, including thousands of Canadian and European tourists in the Jardines del Rey.Dolphins at a Cayo Guillermo resort were evacuated by helicopter.\n\nThe NHC issued several watches and warnings for the Southeastern United States.The first watches and warnings were issued at 15:00 UTC on September 7, which was a hurricane watch from the Jupiter Inlet to Bonita Beach, including the Florida Keys and Lake Okeechobee.The watches and warnings were extended into Georgia and South Carolina on September 9.At 21:00 UTC on that day, the advisories reached their maximum extent, with a hurricane warning covering the entire east coast of the state, the west coast from Indian Pass southward, and the Florida Keys; a hurricane watch was in place from the Florida–Georgia state line to Edisto Beach, South Carolina; and there were two tropical storm warnings, one in Florida from Indian Pass to the Okaloosa–Walton county line and the other from the Florida–Georgia state line to the South Santee River in South Carolina.Watches and warnings were gradually discontinued as Irma moved inland and weakened, with all of them canceled by early on September 12.\n\nOn September 4, Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency.Governor Scott placed 100 members of the Florida National Guard on duty to assist in preparations.All 7,000 troops were ordered to be on duty by September 8.Officials advised residents to stock their hurricane kits.The state coordinated with electrical companies in order for power outages to be restored as quickly as possible, extending resources such as equipment, fuel, and lodging for the approximately 24,000 restoration personnel who had been activated.Governor Scott suspended tolls on all toll roads in Florida, including the turnpike.All state offices in Florida were closed from September 8 to September 11, while public schools, state colleges, and state universities in all 67 counties were closed during the same period.The Florida Department of Education coordinated with school districts as the need for transportation by school buses and opening shelters arose.By September 9, more than 150 state parks were closed.Throughout the state, almost 700 emergency shelters were opened.The shelters collectively housed about 191,764 people, with more than 40% of them staying in a shelter in South Florida.Additionally, more than 60 special needs shelters were opened, which housed more than 5,000 people by September 9.\n\nMany airports across the state, particularly in Central and South Florida, were closed.Nearly 9,000 flights intending to arrive in or depart from Florida were canceled.Along Florida\'s coasts, most seaports were closed or opened with restricted access.For the fifth time in its 45-year history, the Walt Disney World Resort was completely closed due to the storm.Its theme parks, water parks, and Disney Springs were all closed by 9:00 p.m. on September 9 and remained closed until September 12.Other Orlando-area theme parks, including Universal Orlando Resort and SeaWorld Orlando, were also closed.The Kennedy Space Center was closed from September 8 to September 15.\n\nAn estimated 6.5 million Floridians were ordered to evacuate, mostly those living on barrier islands or in coastal areas; in mobile or sub-standard homes; and in low-lying or flood prone areas.Mandatory evacuations were ordered for portions of Brevard, Broward, Citrus, Collier, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Glades, Hendry, Hernando, Indian River, Lee, Martin, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Lucie, Sumter, and Volusia counties.All of Monroe County, where the Florida Keys are located, was placed under a mandatory evacuation.Residents in communities near the southern half of Lake Okeechobee were also ordered to leave.Additionally, voluntary evacuation notices were issued for all or parts of Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Charlotte, Columbia, Desoto, Hardee, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lake, Manatee, Okeechobee, Osceola, and Polk counties.\n\nA record 6.5 million Floridians evacuated, making it the largest evacuation in the state\'s history.Evacuees caused significant traffic congestion on northbound Interstate 95, Interstate 75, and Florida\'s Turnpike, exacerbated by the fact that the entire Florida peninsula was within the cone of uncertainty in the NHC\'s forecast path in the days before the storm, so evacuees from both coasts headed north, as evacuees would not be safer by fleeing to the opposite coast.Fuel was in short supply throughout peninsular Florida during the week before Irma\'s arrival, especially along evacuation routes, leading to hours-long lines at fuel stations and even escorts of fuel trucks by the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nUse of the left shoulder as a lane for moving traffic was allowed on northbound Interstate 75 from Wildwood to the Georgia state line beginning September 8 and on eastbound Interstate 4 from Tampa to State Road 429 near Celebration for a few hours on September 9.It was the first time that the shoulder-use plan, which was introduced at the start of the 2017 hurricane season, was implemented by the state for hurricane evacuations.The shoulder-use plan was implemented in place of labor- and resource-intensive contraflow lane reversal, in which both sides of an interstate highway are used for one direction of traffic.\n\nOfficials from the Environmental Protection Agency, which had been criticized for its response to Hurricane Harvey, took special measures to inspect and secure hazardous materials, especially at Superfund sites.Direct Relief, a disaster relief organization, coordinated with local health centers and provided resources to help facilities on the front lines of Floridian and Puerto Rican communities.\n\nGeorgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency initially for all six coastal counties on September 6, but eventually expanded the declaration to 94 counties south of Atlanta metropolitan area, and then the entire state on September 10.Atlanta was placed under its first-ever tropical storm warning.Governor Deal ordered mandatory evacuations for all areas east of Interstate 95 on September 7, before extending the order to the entirety of Chatham County and low-lying areas west of I-95 on the following day.In total, 540,000 people on the Georgia coast were ordered to leave.Contraflow lane reversal for Interstate 16 took effect on the morning of September 9 from Savannah to Dublin, Georgia.All Georgia state parks were open for free to evacuees, as was the 800-acre camping area at Atlanta Motor Speedway.Reversible HOT lanes on Interstate 75 in Georgia through south metro Atlanta were open 24 hours northbound with no tolls.\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on September 6, with South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster following suit the same day.Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency on September 8 in order to protect Virginia residents and to mobilize resources in support of neighboring states.Officials in New Orleans stated that there would not be much time for preparations if Irma failed to make the projected northward turn, but that South Texas or Florida would not be a good evacuation destination.On September 10, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam issued an executive order allowing medical professionals in other states to practice in Tennessee to aid Hurricane Irma evacuees.This order also allowed pharmacies to give out 14-day supplies of medicine, and gave women and children from outside the state the ability to participate in the Tennessee Department of Health programs.Bristol Motor Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway, and Charlotte Motor Speedway all opened their campgrounds to evacuees free of charge.\n\nIn professional sports, the Miami Dolphins–Tampa Bay Buccaneers game scheduled for September 10 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was postponed to November 19 due to the storm\'s threat.The Dolphins left early for their road game against the Los Angeles Chargers.The Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees moved their September 11–13 series from Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg to Citi Field in Queens.Minor League Baseball\'s Florida State League, Carolina League, and Southern League called off their championship finals and as a result, named their division series winners league co-champions.The Miami FC versus San Francisco Deltas match on September 10 was cancelled so the players and staff could prepare for the storm with their families.The Orlando Pride of the National Women\'s Soccer League rescheduled their September 9 match to September 7. Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer did not have any scheduled home games in September, but was unable to return to training facilities in Orlando due to Hurricane Irma.\n\nIn college football, the UCF Knights-Memphis Tigers game scheduled for September 9 was moved to September 30, replacing UCF\'s game against Maine and Memphis game against Georgia State.UCF also cancelled their game against Georgia Tech on September 16, as UCF\'s stadium hosted the National Guard.The USF Bulls-Connecticut Huskies football game was also cancelled.The Miami Hurricanes–Arkansas State Redwolves game scheduled for September 9 at Centennial Bank Stadium in Arkansas was canceled due to travel concerns for the University of Miami.The Florida Gators-Northern Colorado Bears match in Gainesville scheduled for September 9 was cancelled.The Florida State Seminoles contest against the Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks was canceled on September 8.The Seminoles\' rivalry game with the Hurricanes in Tallahassee, originally scheduled for September 16, was postponed tp October 7.The FIU Panthers game against the Alcorn State Braves was moved up a day and relocated to Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.The Georgia Southern Eagles game against the New Hampshire Wildcats on September 9 was also moved to Legion Field for that day.\n\nAs of September 5, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding was running dangerously low, due to its response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas the previous week, prompting the Trump administration to request an immediate $8 billion in additional funding as Irma approached Florida.Given the rate that current funds are being consumed and the catastrophic damage, the United States Senate almost doubled the requested amount to $15.3 billion, with the understanding that this would only be about 10% of what will be required for responding to Harvey.\n\nHurricane Irma\'s path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating, with landfalls in Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Martin, the Bahamas, Cuba, and the United States, all at major hurricane intensity.Furthermore, the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences.Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria.\n\nThe eyewall of the hurricane moved over Barbuda near its record peak intensity early on September 6; a weather station observed a wind gust of .The same station also recorded a minimum barometric pressure of .The exact state of the island remained unclear for hours after Irma\'s passage, as downed phone lines ceased all communication with nearby islands.Later that afternoon, Prime Minister Gaston Browne surveyed the territory by helicopter, revealing an effectively uninhabitable island.Irma damaged or destroyed 95% of the structures on Barbuda, including its hospital, schools, and both of its hotels; it completely flattened some residential blocks while submerging others.The destruction rendered the island\'s sole airport and much of its infrastructure inoperative—including water and telecommunication services—which further hampered relief efforts.Property damage on Barbuda ranged from $150 million to $300 million.A total of three storm-related deaths were reported on the island.\n\nIn addition to the catastrophic impact on Barbuda\'s human residents, concern turned to the storm\'s effects on the island\'s wildlife.The island\'s only endemic bird, the near-threatened Barbuda warbler, numbered less than 2,000 individuals prior to the hurricane.For some time it was unknown if the warbler survived the hurricane or its aftermath; however within a few months it was confirmed that not only did the species survive, but the most of the birds survived the storm.Barbuda\'s Codrington Lagoon, home to the largest colony of magnificent frigatebirds in the Caribbean, with an estimated 2,500 nesting pairs, was also inundated by the storm surge.\n\nRemaining just outside of Irma\'s strongest windfield, Antigua sustained less severe damage, in the form of leveled roofs and fences, downed power poles and lines, and uprooted trees.Some street flooding also took place in low-lying areas.Three people were treated for minor storm-related injuries.Forensic disaster analysts from the Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM), a Germany-based risk management agency, estimate that economic losses for Antigua and Barbuda will exceed $120 million.\n\nOn the morning of September 6, Irma\'s center crossed the island of Saint Martin while the storm was at peak intensity, sweeping away entire structures, submerging roads and cars, and triggering an island-wide blackout.Irma\'s extreme winds ripped trees out of the ground and sent vehicles and debris from damaged structures scattered across the territory.On the French side of Saint-Martin, entire marinas around Marigot were left in ruins, littered with the stranded remnants of boats that had smashed into each other.A hotel caught on fire, but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze.Another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor.Media images depicted devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds had shattered their windows.Irma killed four people on the French side of the island and injured 50 others, one of whom was in critical condition.As many as 95% of the buildings there were damaged to some degree; 60% of those were totally uninhabitable.Estimates from CEDIM indicate a minimum of $950 million worth of economic losses.Total losses exceeded €3.5 billion (US$4.17 billion).\n\nA similar situation unfolded in Sint Maarten, Saint Martin\'s Dutch half, as intense winds ripped through buildings and lifted vehicles aloft ""as if they were matches"".The hurricane wreaked havoc on Princess Juliana International Airport, with ""huge chunks of the building [strewn] across the runway and a jet bridge snapped in half.""It demolished or severely damaged about 70% of Sint Maarten\'s houses, forcing thousands of residents into public shelters.There were 4 deaths and 23 injuries, 11 of which were serious, in the Dutch territory.Irma is considered the worst natural disaster to hit Sint Maarten; the extent of its damage far exceeded that of any previous hurricane.Total damages were estimated at €2.5 billion (US$2.98 billion).\n\nIrma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the French island of Saint Barthélemy, southeast of Saint Martin.Describing the extent of the destruction, one local compared it to ""a bomb that burned all vegetation,"" while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively ""erased the island from the map"".Violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments, with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation.Streets in the capital of Gustavia were turned into rushing rivers, which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture.The island\'s fire station was inundated with up to of flood waters.With scores of homes and much of the infrastructure destroyed, the majority of the island\'s population was left stranded and without water, electricity or phone service.The associated economic losses could exceed $480 million according to CEDIM\'s analysts.\n\nPreliminary assessments from the French government indicate that Hurricane Irma caused a combined €1.2 billion (US$1.43 billion) in insured losses across the French territories of Saint-Martin and Saint Barts.This total covered private property such as homes, vehicles and businesses (including lost revenue); the extent of the damage to infrastructural and public facilities remains undetermined.Nonetheless, this made Irma one of the costliest natural disasters to hit the French Republic in 50 years.\n\nOn January 30, 2018, roughly five months after Irma, an analysis was published indicating that an anemometer on the island recorded an unofficial gust to before failing.\n\nThe British Overseas Territory of Anguilla saw the eyewall of the storm pass over it on September 6.Many homes and schools were destroyed, and the island\'s only hospital was badly damaged.The devastation was particularly severe in East End, where the winds uprooted scores of trees and power poles and demolished a number of houses.In The Valley, the island\'s capital, the hurricane blew out the windows of government buildings.Rough seas inflicted heavy damage upon several bays and harbors, and a seaside restaurant was completely eradicated.About 90% of roads were left impassable.The island\'s air traffic control tower was damaged, exacerbating the already poor communication with the island.One death was reported on the island.Estimates of losses on the island total at least $190 million.\n\nLarge swells ahead of Irma washed ashore debris and sea life in Castries, Saint Lucia, blocking some roads.Seaside roads were inundated with water.One surfer was killed amid rough surf in Barbados after hitting a reef and breaking his neck.Trees were also destroyed.The hurricane\'s effects, such as violent seas and rattling trees, were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in Guadeloupe.Several houses were damaged.Around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm, leaving several communes in the dark without running water.Overall damage was limited to external parts of houses and trees that were blown onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seas.\n\nSaint Kitts and Nevis endured similar conditions to other islands.Blustery rainstorms triggered scattered power outages and disabled the island\'s water system, but per the International Red Cross, the islands were spared the level of destruction seen elsewhere.Still, Prime Minister Timothy Harris stated that property and infrastructure had sustained ""significant damage.""The Dutch territories of Saba and Sint Eustatius were also struck by the hurricane\'s winds, resulting in infrastructural damage, water shortages and telecommunication outages.Several houses were left uninhabitable.On Saba, the hurricane also defoliated trees and injured a few people.CEDIM\'s analysts expect economic losses of $20–65 million for the two islands.\n\nDamage in the British Virgin Islands was extensive.Numerous buildings and roads were destroyed on the island of Tortola, which bore the brunt of the hurricane\'s core.Four people were confirmed dead.Along Cane Garden Bay, the storm surge submerged several seaside bars and a gas station.Satellite images revealed many of the island\'s residential zones had been left in ruins.The hurricane passed over Necker Island, also causing severe damage and destroying the mansion of Richard Branson.\n\nMost homes and businesses were destroyed on the island of Jost Van Dyke, the smallest of the B.V.I.\'s four main islands.The Governor, Gus Jaspert, who had only been sworn into office 13 days previously, declared a state of emergency - the first time this has ever happened in the Territory.After the storm, restoration of electricity took approximately 5 months.\n\nIrma\'s effects in the U.S. Virgin Islands were most profound on Saint Thomas, where at least of rain fell, and on Saint John.Saint Thomas island suffered widespread structural damage, including to its police station and airport.Patients from the fourth and third floors of Charlotte Amalie\'s hospital had to be relocated to lower floors due to flooding from roof leaks.Three deaths were attributed to Irma on the island.On nearby Saint Croix, there were communication issues and some damage to the infrastructure.Saint John lost access to ferry and cargo services, along with access to the local airport.Due to its normal reliance on electricity from Saint Thomas, the island was left without power.Total damage from the three islands was at least $1.1 billion.\n\nThe hurricane passed north of Puerto Rico, but still caused significant damage to the United States territory.Along the coast, a tide gauge observed waves up to mean higher high water.Much of the main island experienced sustained tropical storm force winds, with a peak sustained wind speed of at a weather station along San Juan Bay, while the same site observed a peak wind gust of .However, on the island of Culebra, a wind gust of was reported.Mainly due to strong winds, approximately 1.1 million out of 1.5 million of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority\'s customers lost electricity.Portions of Puerto Rico received heavy rainfall, with a peak total of in Bayamón, causing seven rivers to reach flood stage, widespread flash flooding, and at least six landslides.\n\nThe most severely affected areas included the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques, as well as the northeastern, northern, and mountainous portions of the main island.On Culebra, the island suffered an almost complete loss of electrical and water services.At least 30 homes on the island were destroyed, while about 30 other experienced substantial damage.High winds also toppled a number of trees.The only telecommunications tower on Culebra sustained damage, cutting off outside communications for several hours.In rural Loíza, 79 homes were destroyed.Throughout Puerto Rico, 781 out of 1,600 telecommunications towers went out of commission, primarily due to power outages.At least 362,000 customers lost water services.Debris, mostly fallen trees, blocked at least 72 roads.Approximately 25% to 30% of banana, coffee, papaya, and plantain crops were damaged by strong winds, with losses to farmers estimated at $30.6 million.Approximately 1,530 homes experienced at least moderate damage, with 1,448 homes moderately damaged, 32 extensively damaged, and 50 completely destroyed.\n\nHurricane Irma was attributed to around $1 billion in damage, and the NHC attributed three fatalities to Irma in Puerto Rico, though four deaths were related to the storm.Two people died due to rainstorms ahead of the hurricane: one man died in Orocovis after falling off his ladder while repairing his roof; another man on the coast in Capitanejo died after being struck by lightning.Three nearby fishermen were burned by the same lightning strike, but survived.Two other people died during the hurricane: a woman died while being evacuated from her house in a wheelchair and fell, hitting her head; another person died in a car accident in Canóvanas.Governor Ricardo Rosselló declared the islands of Culebra and Vieques to be disaster areas.\n\nAlthough spared a direct hit, both the Dominican Republic and Haiti were affected by high winds and heavy rains.A bridge over the Dajabón River connecting the two countries was broken.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, the fishing community of Nagua sustained damage from waves that destroyed homes.55,000 soldiers were deployed to affected areas to help with the clean-up efforts.By the evening of September 7, the government had counted 2,721 damaged homes.\n\nIn Haiti, flooding one meter deep sat in residential neighborhoods in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives.Mudslides, destroyed homes, flooded crops, and infrastructure damage were reported in the northern part of the country.The total expanse of the flooding stretched from Môle-Saint-Nicolas in the west to the eastern border with the Dominican Republic.\n\nOn the evening of September 7, at 7:30 pm AST (23:30 UTC), Hurricane Irma reached the Turks and Caicos Islands.While the eye passed just south of the main islands, crossing over South Caicos and the Ambergris Cays, the most powerful winds on the northern side of the eye swept all of the islands for more than two hours.Communications infrastructure was destroyed.\n\nOn September 8, Minister of Infrastructure Goldray Ewing confirmed that damage to Providenciales was extensive, with the northwestern neighborhood of Blue Hill being ""gone"".The hospital in the capital, Cockburn Town, was heavily damaged.On South Caicos, 75% of roofs were lost.Total damage was estimated at over $500 million.\n\nIn the Bahamas, the eye of the storm passed over Duncan Town, the major settlement of the Ragged Islands chain, on September 8.It also passed ""almost directly over"" Inagua and South Acklins, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.\n\nDamages were largely confined to the southern islands starting the morning of September 8.On Mayaguana and Great Inagua, downed power lines knocked out communications.On Great Inagua, 70% of homes sustained roof damage, and the island\'s school lost its roof entirely.The Morton Salt Company\'s signature production facility, one of the major employers in the country, experienced millions of dollars in damages.The Acklins settlement of Salina Point was cut off from the rest of the island by flooding, while Crooked Island had widespread roof damage.In the northern Bahamas, the worst property damage came on September 10 as the outer bands of the system produced tornadic activity on Grand Bahama and Bimini.Damage and losses across The Bahamas amounted to $135 million.\n\nWhile Irma was making landfall in Florida, the ocean was drawn away from some western shorelines of the Bahamas due to strong easterly winds.\n\nEarly on September 9, Irma made landfall on the Camagüey Archipelago off the northern coast of Cuba, with sustained winds of .The strongest official sustained wind speed was , while the highest wind gust reached ; both were observed near Camila in Ciego de Ávila Province.The weather station at Esmeralda, Camagüey, was damaged, with the wind gauge destroyed.The north coast of Cuba experienced significant coastal flooding due to storm surge and abnormally high tides generated by the storm.Wave heights at Cayo Romano exceeded .Storm surge penetrated as far as inland in some areas of Villa Clara Province.Multiple locations on the island observed at least of rainfall, with a peak total of of precipitation at Topes de Collantes.\n\nA total of 158,554 homes experienced some degree of damage, of which 14,657 were destroyed; approximately 1.9 million people experienced the direct effects of Irma.The storm partially deroofed 103,691 homes, while 23,560 were completely deroofed.Irma damaged or destroyed 980 health facilities and 2,264 schools.Approximately 3.1 million people experienced disruptions to the water supply, while 246,707 people lost telephone service.About of roads were damaged.Crops also suffered extensively, with nearly affected by the storm.Throughout the country, the hurricane inflicted $13.185 billion in damage and killed 10 people, making Irma the costliest tropical cyclone in Cuban history.\n\nThe tourist areas of Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and Cayo Santa María and the nearby town of Caibarién received the brunt of the storm, with waves rolling through town and the characteristic one-story homes completely flooded.The storm most severely Ciego de Ávila and Villa Clara provinces.Flooding worsened as the hurricane moved west, pushing the storm surge along to the regions around Havana.By the afternoon, limited flooding was occurring in Havana, including around the Malecón.Portions of province coastal flooding surpassing that which was experienced during the Storm of the Century in 1993 and Hurricane Wilma in 2005.In the city of Santa Clara, 39 buildings collapsed.Rainfall resulted in several rivers reaching major flood stage.The town of Cabaiguán in Sancti Spíritus Province in particular suffered extensive inland flooding after the Zaza River swelled.\n\nHurricane Irma directly affected a major colony of American flamingos on Cuba\'s northern Cayo Coco.Early reports from Diario de Cuba indicated that several hundred flamingos had been killed by the storm, though other estimates ranged as high as several thousand birds.\n\nHurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida.Except for the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned.Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba, but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys.The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States.After surveying the aftermath of Irma, Florida governor Rick Scott said ""I thought we would see more damage""[on the mainland] but said ""he witnessed devastation in the Keys"".President Donald Trump commented on Twitter that the devastation in some places was ""far greater than anyone thought"".\n\nDamage in the United States was estimated at a minimum of $50 billion.At the time, Irma was the fourth costliest tropical cyclone in the United States, behind hurricanes Sandy in 2012, Harvey earlier that year, and Katrina in 2005.However, later in September 2017, Hurricane Maria became the third costliest United States tropical cyclone, causing Irma to fall to the fifth costliest.At least 92 people, 10 directly and 82 indirectly, died throughout the United States in relation to Irma: 84 in Florida, 3 in Georgia, 3 in South Carolina, and 2 in North Carolina.\n\nIrma struck the state less than two weeks after Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten had caused the worst flooding seen in western Florida in 20 years, which further worsened the impacts in the region.The storm\'s large wind field resulted in strong winds across much of Florida, except for the western Panhandle.The highest reported sustained wind speed was on Marco Island, while the strongest observed wind gust was , recorded near Naples, though wind gusts of likely occurred in the Middle Florida Keys.More than 7.7 million homes and businesses in Florida were left without electricity at some point – approximately 73% of state.Generally heavy amounts of rainfall were recorded to the east of the Irma\'s path, including a peak total of in Fort Pierce.Heavy precipitation – and storm surge, in some instances – overflowed at least 32 rivers and creeks, causing significant flooding, particularly along the St. Johns River and its tributaries.Many homes and businesses suffered damage or destruction, with more than 65,000 structures damaged to some degree in West Central and Southwest Florida alone.Agriculture experienced about $2.5 billion in damage.It was estimated that the cyclone caused at least $50 billion in damage, making Irma the costliest hurricane in Florida history, surpassing Hurricane Andrew, until it was itself surpassed by Hurricane Ian, 5 years later.\n\nThroughout Florida, at least 84 people died in storm-related incidents.About half of the deaths occurred from drowning, trauma, and carbon monoxide poisoning.Broward County had 21 fatalities, the most of any county in Florida.Among those deaths were 12 people at The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, a Hollywood nursing home.The patients died from sweltering heat worsened by the lack of air conditioning.The hurricane also left at least 14 deaths in Monroe County; 6 deaths in Orange County; 5 deaths each in Duval, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties; 4 deaths in both Highlands and Hillsborough counties; 3 deaths in both Marion and Polk counties; 2 deaths each in Collier, Hardee, Leon, Pinellas, St. Lucie, and Taylor counties; and 1 death in Hendry, Lake, Lee, Liberty, Manatee, Nassau, Okeechobee, Pasco, Seminole, St. Johns, and Volusia counties.\n\nWith Irma making landfall in Monroe County as a Category 4 hurricane, the Florida Keys were hardest hit area in the state.Strong winds and storm surge flooding caused major damage to buildings, trailer parks, boats, roads, the electricity supply, mobile phone coverage, internet access, sanitation, the water supply and the fuel supply throughout the island chain.An estimated storm surge occurred at Cudjoe Key, where Irma made landfall.Throughout the island, 625 homes sustained minor damage, 52 sustained major damage, and 81 were demolished.On Big Pine Key, one of the most devastated islands, 633 homes received minor impact, 299 homes received major impact, and 473 homes were completely destroyed.Overall in Monroe County, 27,649 homes experienced some degree of damage, including 1,179 homes being destroyed, 2,977 homes receiving major damage, and 5,361 suffering minor damage.\n\nAfter devastating the Keys, the storm then struck Collier County as a Category 3 hurricane.Several communities in the county suffered extensive damage, especially along the coast.Throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, 65 homes, including 44 mobile homes, were demolished, while 1,008 homes received major damage.Property damages in unincorporated areas alone reach about $320 million.Lee County was lashed by strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused prolonged flooding in some areas.More than 24,000 homes suffered some degree of damage, with almost 3,000 homes receiving major damage and 89 homes being destroyed.Damage in the county totaled about $857 million.\n\nImpact in much of the Miami metropolitan area was generally limited to extensive tree and fence damage, as well as widespread power outages.However, in Miami-Dade County, about 1,000 homes received major damage and about 50% of crops were lost.Storm surge caused coastal flooding from Homestead to Downtown Miami, as well as in portions of Miami Beach.Parts of the Florida Heartland were devastated by high winds and flooding, particularly Hendry and Highlands counties.In the former, which has most citrus trees of any county in Florida, about 60% of orange crops were lost.Throughout Hendry County, a total of 451 homes had minor damage, 131 homes suffered major damage, and 42 others were destroyed.In Highlands County, 13,138 businesses and homes were damaged to some degree, with 144 being destroyed, 963 sustaining major damage, and 2,408 receiving minor damage.In Orange County, wind gusts reached 79 mph at Orlando International Airport.A wind gust of 91 mph was also recorded in Orlando at the top of the Disney Contemporary Resort.Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central Florida left some wind damage and flooding, necessitating evacuations and rescues, including more than 200 people in Orlo Vista after hundreds of homes were flooded.A total of 2,999 business or homes were damaged in Lake County, 7,430 in Seminole County, and 3,457 in Volusia County.Additionally, eight tornadoes touched down in Brevard County, all of which caused damage.\n\nAlong much of the Gulf Coast of Florida, to the north of where Irma made landfall, negative storm surges were observed, with water retracting rather than pushing inland, causing little coastal flooding.However, on the opposite coast, extensive erosion and storm surge flooding occurred in the First Coast, especially in Duval and St. Johns counties.In Duval County, the St. Johns River crested at heights that exceeded records set during Hurricane Dora in 1964.Portions of Jacksonville experienced flooding, particularly the downtown area and the Riverside and San Marco neighborhoods, with about 350 people rescued in those sections of the city.Water reached about high in some homes.The city of Jacksonville suffered about $85 million in damage.\n\nIn St. Johns County, storm surge left extensive damage to oceanfront properties in Ponte Vedra Beach and Vilano Beach, with several becoming uninhabitable.Additionally, some riverfront businesses in St. Augustine\'s historic district were flooded due to storm surge from the Matanzas River.In nearby Clay County, rainfall and storm surge combined to cause extensive flooding along portions of the Black Creek and the St. Johns River, with record high crests at several locations along the former.About 350 people and 75 animals were rescued from floodwaters throughout the county.A total of 275 homes were destroyed, 175 were inflicted major damage, and 124 received minor damage.\n\nThree deaths were reported in Georgia due to falling trees and debris, along with widespread wind damage and power outages throughout the state primarily due to fallen trees.On Tybee Island, as well as St. Simons Island the storm surge caused extensive flooding.The tropical storm also did $54 million in damage in the state.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the third highest storm surge on record was recorded, reaching a height of approximately .By of September 12, almost 100,000 had lost power in Upstate South Carolina.Five people died in storm-related incidents across South Carolina, all from indirect incidents.The tropical storm caused damages totaling $500,000 in the state.\n\nLight damage occurred in other areas, including Tennessee.About 75,000 customers in North Carolina lost power due to Irma.It also caused $600,000 in damages in Alabama.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Irma\'s path through the West Indies and Caribbean, the devastation to roads, harbors and airports significantly impeded the transportation and distribution of relief supplies.Foreign countries moved to provide much of the initial aid.The British, Dutch, French, and United States governments sent warships and planes with supplies and manpower to the region.International leaders, including Dutch King Willem-Alexander and French President Emmanuel Macron, quickly moved to visit affected territories.\n\nSome of the affected countries and territories also offered assistance to each other.Cuba, which sustained extensive damage from the storm, sent 750 health workers to Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, Dominica, and Haiti.Government officials and members of the public in Puerto Rico delivered assistance and evacuated people stranded on other islands.The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services granted special 30-day humanitarian visas for British Virgin Islanders to stay in Puerto Rico.Hundreds of people stranded on Saint Martin were flown to the Dominican Republic on humanitarian grounds.\n\nIn response to Hurricane Jose\'s approach, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a mandatory evacuation on September 9 for any remaining residents on Barbuda.A Miami cargo plane landed on Antigua later that day, carrying over 60 tons (120,000 lbs) of relief supplies for the displaced storm victims—including bottled water, canned food and power generators.\n\nRFA Mounts Bay stationed itself near Anguilla and provided support and relief work to the island with its helicopters and 40 marines and army engineers.The ship delivered 6 tonnes of emergency aid to Anguilla and army engineers repaired a fuel leak at Anguilla\'s main petrol dump, restored power to the island\'s hospital and provided shelters for those left homeless by the hurricane.The ship arrived in the British Virgin Islands on September 8, 2017, to provide emergency relief to the islands, including providing shelters, food and water.HMS Ocean was diverted from the Mediterranean to provide relief from Gibraltar to the affected British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos on September 7, and aid was also supplied by the Department for International Development from their disaster response centre at Kemble Airfield.As part of a £32 million operation named Operation Ruman, nearly 500 UK military personnel with emergency relief were dispatched from RAF Brize Norton.This included the first deployment of No. 38 Expeditionary Air Wing with 3 RAF aircraft; 2 Airbus A400M Atlas and 1 C130J hercules to support relief efforts.\n\nThe British government also drafted 2 members of the UK police calibre into the region on September 10, and 53 police officers were drafted from RAF Brize Norton to the affected British Overseas Territories on September 15 to help maintain order.UK politicians, including the chairs of the foreign affairs and development select committees, criticized both the government\'s preparations for the storm and its response as inadequate.\n\nBy September 12, the Department for International Development had delivered more than 40 tonnes of aid into the region, including into Turks and Caicos, and 1,000 UK military troops were deployed in the region as part of relief efforts.The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, pledged an additional £25 million worth of funding as part of relief efforts in the region on September 13, 2017, and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Boris Johnson, said that a further 250 UK military personnel would be deployed into the area within the next few days.Anguilla\'s Chief Minister, Victor Banks, praised the British government\'s response to the storm and said that Boris Johnson\'s visit to the island ""sends a very positive signal to Anguillans that the British are serious about their response to this very severe hurricane"", but went on to say that the current financial commitment from the UK was not substantial enough.\n\nBy September 15, the United Kingdom had over 70 military personnel and 4 police officers in Anguilla and had delivered 15 tonnes of aid to the island.In the British Virgin Islands, Royal Marines had cleared the airfield so that it was operational for the delivery of aid into the islands, with more than 200 British military personnel and 54 UK police officers on the ground and 8 tonnes of aid delivered to the islands.120 British military personnel were on the ground in Turks and Caicos, and over 150 shelter kits and 720 liters of water were delivered to the islands on September 15.\n\nAmendments to international aid rules by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (or OECD) allowed for the UK government to provide access to £13 billion worth of aid to the affected British Overseas Territories, through the UK\'s Official Development Assistance (ODA) by November 2017.\n\nBy the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage.The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by Irma\'s eye, remained largely inaccessible for days.Assessments showed that 15% of the national telecommunications network had been affected, with at least one tower destroyed.Bahamasair resumed a limited domestic schedule on September 10, with international flights still cancelled due to existing and anticipated destruction at other destinations.\n\nThe worst devastation occurred on Ragged Island, over which Irma\'s eye had directly passed.After days of the National Emergency Management Agency not being able to physically reach the island, officials were finally able to inspect it; they promptly declared it uninhabitable.Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said that it was the worst disaster area he or his officials had ever seen, and that all remaining residents would need to leave, potentially permanently.Business leaders and other officials called for a new long-term development model to shift the population away from such sparsely-settled islands.\n\nOn Grand Bahama and Bimini, where tornadoes associated with Irma touched down on September 10, more than 100 people were left displaced.Infrastructure damage included docks, parks, and the power system.\n\nAside from tangible asset losses, Irma brought significant economic damages.International freight shipping was projected to be offline for a week, and costs for rebuilding supplies were inflated due to demand in the U.S.\n\nSwollen rivers contributed to worsening flooding in the days after the storm system left, resulting in additional evacuations.Officials resorted to using inflatable rafts to access affected areas.The national electrical infrastructure was said to be extensively damaged.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, flooding worsened following Irma\'s departure, leading the number of displaced persons to increase to more than 24,000 by September 8.President Danilo Medina ordered further evacuations due to at-risk dams, while the government banned swimming in rivers and ordered boats kept in port.More than 422,000 people were left without water due to 28 aqueducts being damaged.\n\nIn Haiti, officials stated that losses were greater than they could have been since people largely did not heed early preparation and evacuation warnings.At least 5,000 homes were flooded.One man died trying to cross a flooded river; another went missing and 17 were injured.The trash- and waste-contaminated floodwaters in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives led to fears of cholera outbreaks.Flooding continued to worsen days after the storm, as runoff from the mountains swelled rivers in low-lying farming communities.United Nations peacekeepers from Brazil were able to gain access to the flooded northwest region to provide urgent aid, but non-governmental organizations and Haitian economists warned that the estimated 30,000 victims would need longer-term assistance as well.Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant appointed a government commission to address Irma\'s effects, with Action Against Hunger in charge of humanitarian coordination.\n\nIn the USVI, residents and tourists alike were described as being in a state of traumatic shock.By September 7, the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship had arrived in the USVI to provide supplies, damage assessment, and evacuation assistance.Four additional warships, some of which had already been on their way to Texas to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief, were redirected to the region.At a September 10 news conference, Governor Kenneth Mapp described Irma as a ""horrific disaster"" for which ""[t]here will be no restorations or solutions in days or weeks.""The Federal Emergency Management Agency airlifted in goods for residents, who were subjected to a curfew.Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line agreed to transport tourists to Florida, contingent upon port availability following the state\'s own experience with Irma.\n\nOn Saint John, described as ""perhaps the site of Irma\'s worst devastation on American soil,"" it took six days for an active-theater disaster zone to be established, leading to criticism of the U.S. government response.The National Guard was delayed in reaching Saint John due to the number of overturned boats left in the harbor.The National Guard was brought in to maintain order, while the Coast Guard brought evacuees to cruise ships bound for San Juan and Miami.There was still no electricity on St. John in the middle of October 2017.\n\nBy September 9, more than one million Puerto Ricans were still without power, tens of thousands were without water, and several thousand were still in shelters.Hospitals were operating on generator power.The government was struggling to establish contact with the islands of Culebra and Vieques.By September 10, the main island had recovered enough to serve as a refuge for people stranded on other islands, including 1,200 tourists from Saint Martin and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Airlifts had brought more than 50 patients to Puerto Rico.\n\nFive months after Irma, two-thirds of the hospital beds on Saint Thomas were still unavailable, due to extensive physical damage and staffing shortages.\n\nDamage to Sint Maarten\'s harbour and to Princess Juliana International Airport left the Dutch part of Saint Martin unreachable, although the smaller Grand Case-Espérance Airport on the French side could be reopened by September 7 for supply aid by helicopter and airplane.The French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops on board a CASA/IPTN CN-235 aircraft.\n\nThe following day, the Dutch military was able to airlift dialysis patients off the island while also dropping leaflets to warn islanders about the rapidly approaching Hurricane Jose.Although the airport was closed, 435 students and faculty of the American University of the Caribbean were evacuated by the U.S. military.On September 10, Dutch King Willem-Alexander departed for the region, with intentions to visit Sint Maarten and other affected Dutch territories and commonwealth members.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron followed this announcement by stating his intentions to visit the French part of the island on September 12 in order to bring aid supplies.In response to criticism of the French handling of the disaster, 1,000 troops, police, and other emergency workers were sent to Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.\n\nOn both sides of Saint Martin, desperate conditions combined with food and water shortages in Irma\'s aftermath led to reports of violence, scavenging, and theft.In response, the French government increased its troop deployment to 2,200 and the Dutch government sent more than 600 military and police personnel.\n\nThe day after the hurricane hit Saint Barthelemy the French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops into the reopened Grand Case-Espérance Airport.On September 7 and 9, equipment and personnel were flown from France to Guadeloupe and Martinique.\n\nSporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm.\n\nOn September 11, Florida Governor Rick Scott conducted an aerial tour to survey the damage to the Keys.The Overseas Highway remained closed while authorities assessed the integrity of the 42 bridges along the route.Residents returning to the Keys were faced with a police roadblock, to the south of Florida City.USS Iwo Jima, USS New York and aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were sent to the Keys area to aid with the recovery.\n\nOn September 12, some residents were allowed to return into the Keys as far as Islamorada.Although road damage blocked entry any farther than Islamorada, bridges had been inspected and found safe to Sugarloaf Key.By late on September 12, the Overseas Highway had been repaired and the bridges inspected as safe for first responders to travel to Key West.On September 16, residents were free to return to Marathon.Residents were allowed to return to Key West the following day, although the Keys remained closed to tourists and a checkpoint remained in place in Florida City.\n\nDue mainly to the widespread loss of power, cell phone service was also reduced after battery backup power for cell phone towers ran out and backup generators ran out of fuel.In an impact report by the FCC, as of 11 AM EDT on September 12, 89 of 108 (82%) cell phone towers were non-functioning in Monroe County (Florida Keys), 154 of 212 (73%) were non-functioning in Collier County (Naples), 36 of 46 (78%) were non-functioning in Hendry County, and an additional six counties had 41-60% of cell phone towers not functioning, including Lee County (Fort Myers) and Miami-Dade County.\n\nNOAA released map-format aerial reconnaissance image data of damage from the storm.The imagery featured several areas of Florida: including the Florida Keys, the southwest coast of Florida from Marco Island to Punta Gorda, much of the northeast coast of Florida, and portions of the Jacksonville area.Portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts were also photographed.Additionally, the Sun-Sentinel published before and after photos of several landmarks in the Florida Keys.\n\nIn the days after the hurricane, due to the heavy rainfall, numerous rivers had flooded, including residential areas.Public health risks, such as diarrheal infections and mosquito-borne illnesses, remain from the flooding that resulted in the aftermath of the hurricane.A large concern from flooding is contamination because people become exposed to dirty floodwaters and the potential for contaminated water to enter the local water supply is significant.One example of an illness that can enter the water supply is leptospirosis, which is rat urine carries into the floodwaters.Untreated exposure to leptospirosis can cause kidney damage, meningitis, and liver failure.Noroviruses and other infections are also a risk.\n\nFollowing Irma\'s passage, a hand-carved wooden canoe was discovered on the banks of the Indian River and could be several hundred years old.The state has removed the canoe for examination and safe keeping.\n\nDue to Irma\'s and Hurricane Harvey\'s impact in Florida and Texas, U.S. employment declined in September 2017 for the first time since September 2010.The leisure and hospitality industries were especially hard hit, losing 111,000 jobs in September.\n\nIrma set multiple records for intensity, especially at easterly longitudes, time spent at such an intensity, and its intensity at landfall.When Irma reached Category 5 intensity with winds of at 11:45 UTC on September 5 at 57.7°W, it became the easternmost Atlantic hurricane of this strength on record, surpassing Hurricane David of 1979, later beaten by Hurricane Lorenzo 2 years later.By 00:15 UTC on September 6, Irma reached peak intensity with () winds and a minimum pressure of .This ties it with Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and Hurricane Rita of 2005 as the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed.Only five other Atlantic hurricanes have been recorded with wind speeds higher than Irma: Hurricane Allen of 1980, which had maximum sustained winds of , and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Gilbert of 1988, Hurricane Wilma of 2005, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, all of which had peak winds of .At the time, Irma was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; later surpassed by Hurricane Dorian, and was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007.In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category 5 strength winds, and the third-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, with a value of 64.9 units.Only the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane and Hurricane Ivan in 2004 achieved higher values.\n\nOn September 6, Irma made landfall on the islands of Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Virgin Gorda at peak strength.This ties Irma with cyclones Monica of 2006 and Winston of 2016, and typhoons Zeb of 1998 and Megi of 2010 as the seventh-strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall globally – in terms of sustained winds – trailing only Typhoon Goni of 2020 which bore winds of at landfall, Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 and Typhoon Meranti of 2016, which bore winds of at landfall, and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Typhoon Joan of 1959, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, which bore winds of at landfall.Irma is second to the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin, and is the first hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic at Category 5 status since Felix in 2007.Irma is the first recorded Category 5 hurricane to affect the northern Leeward Islands, and was one of the worst storms to hit the region on record, along with Hurricane Donna in 1960 and Hurricane Luis in 1995.In addition, Irma is only the second hurricane on record to make landfall in Cuba at Category 5 intensity, with the other being a hurricane in 1924.Furthermore, when Irma made landfall on Barbuda, Saint Martin, Virgin Gorda, and Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane, it became one of only two recorded Atlantic storms to make landfall in multiple nations at this strength; the other was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which struck both Eleuthera and the United States as a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nIrma made landfall in the Florida Keys with winds of and a pressure of , making it the strongest hurricane to strike Florida in terms of wind speed since Charley in 2004, and the most intense to strike the state in terms of barometric pressure since Andrew in 1992.In the span of two weeks, two Category 4 hurricanes—Harvey and Irma—struck the continental United States, the first time on record two Atlantic tropical cyclones of such strength made landfall on the country in the same hurricane season.This also marked only the third occurrence of two consecutive Atlantic storms making landfall in the United States as major hurricanes.The other two instances were the Great Charleston and Cheniere Caminada hurricanes in 1893, and hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne in 2004.\n\nBecause of the extensive damage and loss of life the hurricane caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Irma from its rotating naming lists in April 2018, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane.It was replaced with Idalia for the 2023 season.\n\nWeather of 2017 Tropical cyclones in 2017 List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes Operation RUMAN – UK military-civil disaster relief response to Hurricane Irma.List of Cuba hurricanes List

37,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Hurricane Irma', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'Hurricane Irma was an extremely powerful Cape Verde hurricane that caused widespread destruction across its path in early September 2017.Irma was the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the Leeward Islands on record, followed by Maria two weeks later.At the time, it was considered the most powerful hurricane on record in the open Atlantic region, outside of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, until it was surpassed by Hurricane Dorian two years later.It was also the third-strongest Atlantic hurricane at landfall ever recorded, just behind the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane and Dorian.The ninth named storm, fourth hurricane, second major hurricane, and first Category 5 hurricane of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Irma caused widespread and catastrophic damage throughout its long lifetime, particularly in the northeastern Caribbean and the Florida Keys.It was also the most intense hurricane to strike the continental United States since Katrina in 2005, the first major hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Wilma in the same year, and the first Category 4 hurricane to strike the state since Charley in 2004.The word Irmageddon was coined soon after the hurricane to describe the damage caused by the hurricane.\n\nIrma developed from a tropical wave near the Cape Verde Islands on August 30.Favorable conditions allowed Irma to rapidly intensify into a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson wind scale by late on August 31.The storm\'s intensity fluctuated between Categories 2 and 3 for the next several days, due to a series of eyewall replacement cycles.On September 4, Irma resumed intensifying, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by early on the next day.Early on September 6, Irma peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of and a minimum pressure of .Irma was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017 in terms of barometric pressure, and the strongest worldwide in 2017 in terms of wind speed.Another eyewall replacement cycle caused Irma to weaken back to a Category 4 hurricane, but the storm re-attained Category 5 status before making landfall in Cuba.Although Irma briefly weakened to a Category 2 storm while making landfall on Cuba, the system re-intensified to Category 4 status as it crossed the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, before making landfall on Cudjoe Key on September 10.Irma then weakened to Category 3 status, prior to another landfall in Florida on Marco Island later that day.The system degraded into a remnant low over Alabama and ultimately dissipated on September 13 over Missouri.\n\nThe storm caused catastrophic damage in Barbuda, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Anguilla, and the Virgin Islands as a Category 5 hurricane.The hurricane caused at least 134 deaths: one in Anguilla; one in Barbados; three in Barbuda; four in the British Virgin Islands; 10 in Cuba; 11 in the French West Indies; one in Haiti; three in Puerto Rico; four on the Dutch side of Sint Maarten; 92 in the contiguous United States, and four in the U.S. Virgin Islands.Hurricane Irma was the top Google searched term in the U.S. and globally in 2017.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa on August 26.The tropical wave moved off the coast of the continent late on August 27.Throughout the next two days, showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low-pressure area, as the system passed just south of and then through the Cape Verde Islands on August 29.Around 00:00 UTC on the following day, the system developed into a tropical depression just west of the Cape Verde Islands.Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Irma, based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates.With warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, strengthening was anticipated, with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier air.\n\nThe nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow, as an anticyclone became established over the system, with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images.Early on August 31, shortly after the development of a central dense overcast (CDO) and an eye feature, Irma underwent rapid intensification, becoming a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 UTC and then a Category 3 hurricane, becoming a major hurricane – around 00:00 UTC on September 1.Within a 48-hour period, the hurricane\'s intensity had increased by .On September 2, a ship passed to the west of the center of Irma, recording maximum winds of , which indicated that the eye of Irma remained compact.A strong high pressure system to the north of Irma caused the storm to move west-southwestward between September 2 and September 4.The first aircraft reconnaissance mission departed from Barbados on the afternoon of September 3, discovering an eye in diameter and surface winds of .\n\nOn September 4, after moving into more favorable conditions, Irma strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane.As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by 12:00 UTC on the following day, with winds of .The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at near 18:00 UTC on September 5. Irma acquired annular characteristics around this time, with the storm exhibiting a large, symmetric CDO and an impressive satellite appearance.Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern Leeward Islands.Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of Barbuda at peak intensity, with the storm\'s central minimum pressure having bottomed out at – this was the lowest in the Atlantic since Dean in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of .Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15 UTC on Sint Maarten, and at 16:30 UTC on Virgin Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands, though the storm\'s central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall.\n\nAs the hurricane moved away from the Virgin Islands late on September 6, observations from reconnaissance flights, as well as Doppler radar in San Juan, Puerto Rico, indicated an elliptical eye and double eyewalls.Late on September 6, the cyclone passed about north of Puerto Rico.Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of Hispaniola throughout the day on September 7.After beginning an eyewall replacement cycle, Irma weakened to a Category 4 hurricane as it passed south of the Turks and Caicos Islands early on September 8.This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category 5 intensity, the second-longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above – behind only the 1932 Cuba hurricane.At 05:00 UTC on September 8, Irma made landfall on the island of Little Inagua in the Bahamas with sustained winds of .The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a subtropical ridge to its north.Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category 5 intensity at 18:00 UTC that day east of Cuba as deep convection became more pronounced and organized.The hurricane then made landfall in Cayo Romano, Cuba, at 03:00 UTC on September 9, with winds of .This made Irma only the second Category 5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the 1924 Cuba hurricane.As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category 2 storm later on September 9.\n\nAfter slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards Florida around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental United States.Moving over the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, Irma quickly restrengthened to a Category 4 hurricane at 06:00 UTC on September 10, as deep convection improved and the eye became better defined.In addition, Irma\'s wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of and gale-force winds spanning in diameter.The cyclone made landfall in Cudjoe Key, Florida, at 13:00 UTC on September 10, at Category 4 intensity, with winds of .Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category 3 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30 UTC, in Marco Island, Florida, with sustained winds of .Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category 3 intensity hours after landfall.Passing east of Tampa as a weakening Category 1 hurricane around 06:00 UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation – though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds.The system finally weakened to a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC that day as it entered southern Georgia, while acquiring some extratropical characteristics.At 06:00 UTC on September 12, Irma degenerated to a remnant low just as it entered Alabama, as most of the deep convection had diminished.The remnants persisted for another day or so before dissipating over Missouri on September 13.\n\nGiven that Irma\'s forecast track was along much of the Caribbean island chain, hurricane warnings were issued for the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and parts of Hispaniola on September 5.\n\nIn Antigua and Barbuda, residents safeguarded their homes and cleaned up their properties in anticipation of strong winds.Emergency crews were put on standby at public shelters and hospitals by September 5 to assist with any evacuations.Expecting a direct hit, more than half of the residents on Barbuda took shelter, and relief supplies were preemptively mobilized.The National Emergency Management Organization on Saint Lucia urged small craft operators and swimmers to be mindful of forecasts for high surf.Small Craft Warnings and High Surf Advisories were hoisted for Dominica, where residents were urged to remain vigilant of the potential for high waves, landslides, and flooding.\n\nIn Guadeloupe, low-lying and cliff-edge homes were evacuated at the threat of flooding and erosion.Schools and public businesses closed on September 5 and 6.Hospitals stocked up on three days\' worth of supplies and checked the functionality of their generators.Of the island\'s 32 communes, 22 activated their emergency plans; 1,500 people were urged to take shelter.The island sustained relatively minor damage and became the base for relief efforts on Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.Though the core of the hurricane was expected to remain north of the island, a yellow alert was issued for Martinique due to the likelihood of rough seas.The island dispatched relief supplies and military reinforcements to its neighboring islands of Guadeloupe, Saint Martin.and Saint Barthélemy, which faced a greater risk of a direct impact.\n\nOn September 4, Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency.By September 6, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency had deployed response teams in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.Supplies, including food rations, medical supplies, and blankets, were pre-staged in strategic locations on the islands for distribution.\n\nOn September 5, the Dominican Republic activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage; the United States and Haiti followed suit two days later.According to officials, 11,200 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas prior to the storm\'s arrival.Approximately 7,400 tourists were moved to Santo Domingo, away from beach resorts.In Haiti, government officials and aid organizations struggled with early preparation and evacuation efforts.While some officials blamed reluctance and indifference on the part of the population, others ""admitted they were not prepared for the onslaught and no mandatory evacuation orders were in place ahead of Irma\'s approach.""Local officials contended that they had not received promised funds, supplies, or equipment from the national government.The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti prepared its 1,000 peacekeepers and engineers to assist.\n\nIn the Turks and Caicos, evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas starting September 5. Schools were closed, government buildings were boarded up, and shelters were opened.Officials spread warnings to residents in English, Creole, and Spanish via social media, radio, SMS text, and WhatsApp.In The Bahamas, the government began preparations the week prior to the hurricane\'s arrival, including securing national sports facilities to use as shelters.By September 7, the government had evacuated 1,609 people by air from the southern islands, including 365 from Bimini.Controlled cutting of the power supply to southern and central Bahamian islands was conducted in advance of the storm.Shelters were made available, though usage was low due to most evacuees staying with family on other islands.Of the 2,679 foreign tourists still in The Bahamas on September 7, about 1,200 were being housed at Atlantis Paradise Island, one of the most hurricane-ready structures in the country.\n\nIn Cuba, meteorologists did not initially predict a direct hit.Fuel conservation was enacted in Camagüey Province to ensure that enough would be available during post-storm power outages.The Civil Defense evacuated nearly one million people from low-lying areas, including thousands of Canadian and European tourists in the Jardines del Rey.Dolphins at a Cayo Guillermo resort were evacuated by helicopter.\n\nThe NHC issued several watches and warnings for the Southeastern United States.The first watches and warnings were issued at 15:00 UTC on September 7, which was a hurricane watch from the Jupiter Inlet to Bonita Beach, including the Florida Keys and Lake Okeechobee.The watches and warnings were extended into Georgia and South Carolina on September 9.At 21:00 UTC on that day, the advisories reached their maximum extent, with a hurricane warning covering the entire east coast of the state, the west coast from Indian Pass southward, and the Florida Keys; a hurricane watch was in place from the Florida–Georgia state line to Edisto Beach, South Carolina; and there were two tropical storm warnings, one in Florida from Indian Pass to the Okaloosa–Walton county line and the other from the Florida–Georgia state line to the South Santee River in South Carolina.Watches and warnings were gradually discontinued as Irma moved inland and weakened, with all of them canceled by early on September 12.\n\nOn September 4, Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency.Governor Scott placed 100 members of the Florida National Guard on duty to assist in preparations.All 7,000 troops were ordered to be on duty by September 8.Officials advised residents to stock their hurricane kits.The state coordinated with electrical companies in order for power outages to be restored as quickly as possible, extending resources such as equipment, fuel, and lodging for the approximately 24,000 restoration personnel who had been activated.Governor Scott suspended tolls on all toll roads in Florida, including the turnpike.All state offices in Florida were closed from September 8 to September 11, while public schools, state colleges, and state universities in all 67 counties were closed during the same period.The Florida Department of Education coordinated with school districts as the need for transportation by school buses and opening shelters arose.By September 9, more than 150 state parks were closed.Throughout the state, almost 700 emergency shelters were opened.The shelters collectively housed about 191,764 people, with more than 40% of them staying in a shelter in South Florida.Additionally, more than 60 special needs shelters were opened, which housed more than 5,000 people by September 9.\n\nMany airports across the state, particularly in Central and South Florida, were closed.Nearly 9,000 flights intending to arrive in or depart from Florida were canceled.Along Florida\'s coasts, most seaports were closed or opened with restricted access.For the fifth time in its 45-year history, the Walt Disney World Resort was completely closed due to the storm.Its theme parks, water parks, and Disney Springs were all closed by 9:00 p.m. on September 9 and remained closed until September 12.Other Orlando-area theme parks, including Universal Orlando Resort and SeaWorld Orlando, were also closed.The Kennedy Space Center was closed from September 8 to September 15.\n\nAn estimated 6.5 million Floridians were ordered to evacuate, mostly those living on barrier islands or in coastal areas; in mobile or sub-standard homes; and in low-lying or flood prone areas.Mandatory evacuations were ordered for portions of Brevard, Broward, Citrus, Collier, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Glades, Hendry, Hernando, Indian River, Lee, Martin, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Lucie, Sumter, and Volusia counties.All of Monroe County, where the Florida Keys are located, was placed under a mandatory evacuation.Residents in communities near the southern half of Lake Okeechobee were also ordered to leave.Additionally, voluntary evacuation notices were issued for all or parts of Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Charlotte, Columbia, Desoto, Hardee, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lake, Manatee, Okeechobee, Osceola, and Polk counties.\n\nA record 6.5 million Floridians evacuated, making it the largest evacuation in the state\'s history.Evacuees caused significant traffic congestion on northbound Interstate 95, Interstate 75, and Florida\'s Turnpike, exacerbated by the fact that the entire Florida peninsula was within the cone of uncertainty in the NHC\'s forecast path in the days before the storm, so evacuees from both coasts headed north, as evacuees would not be safer by fleeing to the opposite coast.Fuel was in short supply throughout peninsular Florida during the week before Irma\'s arrival, especially along evacuation routes, leading to hours-long lines at fuel stations and even escorts of fuel trucks by the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nUse of the left shoulder as a lane for moving traffic was allowed on northbound Interstate 75 from Wildwood to the Georgia state line beginning September 8 and on eastbound Interstate 4 from Tampa to State Road 429 near Celebration for a few hours on September 9.It was the first time that the shoulder-use plan, which was introduced at the start of the 2017 hurricane season, was implemented by the state for hurricane evacuations.The shoulder-use plan was implemented in place of labor- and resource-intensive contraflow lane reversal, in which both sides of an interstate highway are used for one direction of traffic.\n\nOfficials from the Environmental Protection Agency, which had been criticized for its response to Hurricane Harvey, took special measures to inspect and secure hazardous materials, especially at Superfund sites.Direct Relief, a disaster relief organization, coordinated with local health centers and provided resources to help facilities on the front lines of Floridian and Puerto Rican communities.\n\nGeorgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency initially for all six coastal counties on September 6, but eventually expanded the declaration to 94 counties south of Atlanta metropolitan area, and then the entire state on September 10.Atlanta was placed under its first-ever tropical storm warning.Governor Deal ordered mandatory evacuations for all areas east of Interstate 95 on September 7, before extending the order to the entirety of Chatham County and low-lying areas west of I-95 on the following day.In total, 540,000 people on the Georgia coast were ordered to leave.Contraflow lane reversal for Interstate 16 took effect on the morning of September 9 from Savannah to Dublin, Georgia.All Georgia state parks were open for free to evacuees, as was the 800-acre camping area at Atlanta Motor Speedway.Reversible HOT lanes on Interstate 75 in Georgia through south metro Atlanta were open 24 hours northbound with no tolls.\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on September 6, with South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster following suit the same day.Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency on September 8 in order to protect Virginia residents and to mobilize resources in support of neighboring states.Officials in New Orleans stated that there would not be much time for preparations if Irma failed to make the projected northward turn, but that South Texas or Florida would not be a good evacuation destination.On September 10, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam issued an executive order allowing medical professionals in other states to practice in Tennessee to aid Hurricane Irma evacuees.This order also allowed pharmacies to give out 14-day supplies of medicine, and gave women and children from outside the state the ability to participate in the Tennessee Department of Health programs.Bristol Motor Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway, and Charlotte Motor Speedway all opened their campgrounds to evacuees free of charge.\n\nIn professional sports, the Miami Dolphins–Tampa Bay Buccaneers game scheduled for September 10 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was postponed to November 19 due to the storm\'s threat.The Dolphins left early for their road game against the Los Angeles Chargers.The Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees moved their September 11–13 series from Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg to Citi Field in Queens.Minor League Baseball\'s Florida State League, Carolina League, and Southern League called off their championship finals and as a result, named their division series winners league co-champions.The Miami FC versus San Francisco Deltas match on September 10 was cancelled so the players and staff could prepare for the storm with their families.The Orlando Pride of the National Women\'s Soccer League rescheduled their September 9 match to September 7. Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer did not have any scheduled home games in September, but was unable to return to training facilities in Orlando due to Hurricane Irma.\n\nIn college football, the UCF Knights-Memphis Tigers game scheduled for September 9 was moved to September 30, replacing UCF\'s game against Maine and Memphis game against Georgia State.UCF also cancelled their game against Georgia Tech on September 16, as UCF\'s stadium hosted the National Guard.The USF Bulls-Connecticut Huskies football game was also cancelled.The Miami Hurricanes–Arkansas State Redwolves game scheduled for September 9 at Centennial Bank Stadium in Arkansas was canceled due to travel concerns for the University of Miami.The Florida Gators-Northern Colorado Bears match in Gainesville scheduled for September 9 was cancelled.The Florida State Seminoles contest against the Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks was canceled on September 8.The Seminoles\' rivalry game with the Hurricanes in Tallahassee, originally scheduled for September 16, was postponed tp October 7.The FIU Panthers game against the Alcorn State Braves was moved up a day and relocated to Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.The Georgia Southern Eagles game against the New Hampshire Wildcats on September 9 was also moved to Legion Field for that day.\n\nAs of September 5, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding was running dangerously low, due to its response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas the previous week, prompting the Trump administration to request an immediate $8 billion in additional funding as Irma approached Florida.Given the rate that current funds are being consumed and the catastrophic damage, the United States Senate almost doubled the requested amount to $15.3 billion, with the understanding that this would only be about 10% of what will be required for responding to Harvey.\n\nHurricane Irma\'s path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating, with landfalls in Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Martin, the Bahamas, Cuba, and the United States, all at major hurricane intensity.Furthermore, the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences.Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria.\n\nThe eyewall of the hurricane moved over Barbuda near its record peak intensity early on September 6; a weather station observed a wind gust of .The same station also recorded a minimum barometric pressure of .The exact state of the island remained unclear for hours after Irma\'s passage, as downed phone lines ceased all communication with nearby islands.Later that afternoon, Prime Minister Gaston Browne surveyed the territory by helicopter, revealing an effectively uninhabitable island.Irma damaged or destroyed 95% of the structures on Barbuda, including its hospital, schools, and both of its hotels; it completely flattened some residential blocks while submerging others.The destruction rendered the island\'s sole airport and much of its infrastructure inoperative—including water and telecommunication services—which further hampered relief efforts.Property damage on Barbuda ranged from $150 million to $300 million.A total of three storm-related deaths were reported on the island.\n\nIn addition to the catastrophic impact on Barbuda\'s human residents, concern turned to the storm\'s effects on the island\'s wildlife.The island\'s only endemic bird, the near-threatened Barbuda warbler, numbered less than 2,000 individuals prior to the hurricane.For some time it was unknown if the warbler survived the hurricane or its aftermath; however within a few months it was confirmed that not only did the species survive, but the most of the birds survived the storm.Barbuda\'s Codrington Lagoon, home to the largest colony of magnificent frigatebirds in the Caribbean, with an estimated 2,500 nesting pairs, was also inundated by the storm surge.\n\nRemaining just outside of Irma\'s strongest windfield, Antigua sustained less severe damage, in the form of leveled roofs and fences, downed power poles and lines, and uprooted trees.Some street flooding also took place in low-lying areas.Three people were treated for minor storm-related injuries.Forensic disaster analysts from the Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM), a Germany-based risk management agency, estimate that economic losses for Antigua and Barbuda will exceed $120 million.\n\nOn the morning of September 6, Irma\'s center crossed the island of Saint Martin while the storm was at peak intensity, sweeping away entire structures, submerging roads and cars, and triggering an island-wide blackout.Irma\'s extreme winds ripped trees out of the ground and sent vehicles and debris from damaged structures scattered across the territory.On the French side of Saint-Martin, entire marinas around Marigot were left in ruins, littered with the stranded remnants of boats that had smashed into each other.A hotel caught on fire, but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze.Another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor.Media images depicted devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds had shattered their windows.Irma killed four people on the French side of the island and injured 50 others, one of whom was in critical condition.As many as 95% of the buildings there were damaged to some degree; 60% of those were totally uninhabitable.Estimates from CEDIM indicate a minimum of $950 million worth of economic losses.Total losses exceeded €3.5 billion (US$4.17 billion).\n\nA similar situation unfolded in Sint Maarten, Saint Martin\'s Dutch half, as intense winds ripped through buildings and lifted vehicles aloft ""as if they were matches"".The hurricane wreaked havoc on Princess Juliana International Airport, with ""huge chunks of the building [strewn] across the runway and a jet bridge snapped in half.""It demolished or severely damaged about 70% of Sint Maarten\'s houses, forcing thousands of residents into public shelters.There were 4 deaths and 23 injuries, 11 of which were serious, in the Dutch territory.Irma is considered the worst natural disaster to hit Sint Maarten; the extent of its damage far exceeded that of any previous hurricane.Total damages were estimated at €2.5 billion (US$2.98 billion).\n\nIrma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the French island of Saint Barthélemy, southeast of Saint Martin.Describing the extent of the destruction, one local compared it to ""a bomb that burned all vegetation,"" while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively ""erased the island from the map"".Violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments, with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation.Streets in the capital of Gustavia were turned into rushing rivers, which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture.The island\'s fire station was inundated with up to of flood waters.With scores of homes and much of the infrastructure destroyed, the majority of the island\'s population was left stranded and without water, electricity or phone service.The associated economic losses could exceed $480 million according to CEDIM\'s analysts.\n\nPreliminary assessments from the French government indicate that Hurricane Irma caused a combined €1.2 billion (US$1.43 billion) in insured losses across the French territories of Saint-Martin and Saint Barts.This total covered private property such as homes, vehicles and businesses (including lost revenue); the extent of the damage to infrastructural and public facilities remains undetermined.Nonetheless, this made Irma one of the costliest natural disasters to hit the French Republic in 50 years.\n\nOn January 30, 2018, roughly five months after Irma, an analysis was published indicating that an anemometer on the island recorded an unofficial gust to before failing.\n\nThe British Overseas Territory of Anguilla saw the eyewall of the storm pass over it on September 6.Many homes and schools were destroyed, and the island\'s only hospital was badly damaged.The devastation was particularly severe in East End, where the winds uprooted scores of trees and power poles and demolished a number of houses.In The Valley, the island\'s capital, the hurricane blew out the windows of government buildings.Rough seas inflicted heavy damage upon several bays and harbors, and a seaside restaurant was completely eradicated.About 90% of roads were left impassable.The island\'s air traffic control tower was damaged, exacerbating the already poor communication with the island.One death was reported on the island.Estimates of losses on the island total at least $190 million.\n\nLarge swells ahead of Irma washed ashore debris and sea life in Castries, Saint Lucia, blocking some roads.Seaside roads were inundated with water.One surfer was killed amid rough surf in Barbados after hitting a reef and breaking his neck.Trees were also destroyed.The hurricane\'s effects, such as violent seas and rattling trees, were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in Guadeloupe.Several houses were damaged.Around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm, leaving several communes in the dark without running water.Overall damage was limited to external parts of houses and trees that were blown onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seas.\n\nSaint Kitts and Nevis endured similar conditions to other islands.Blustery rainstorms triggered scattered power outages and disabled the island\'s water system, but per the International Red Cross, the islands were spared the level of destruction seen elsewhere.Still, Prime Minister Timothy Harris stated that property and infrastructure had sustained ""significant damage.""The Dutch territories of Saba and Sint Eustatius were also struck by the hurricane\'s winds, resulting in infrastructural damage, water shortages and telecommunication outages.Several houses were left uninhabitable.On Saba, the hurricane also defoliated trees and injured a few people.CEDIM\'s analysts expect economic losses of $20–65 million for the two islands.\n\nDamage in the British Virgin Islands was extensive.Numerous buildings and roads were destroyed on the island of Tortola, which bore the brunt of the hurricane\'s core.Four people were confirmed dead.Along Cane Garden Bay, the storm surge submerged several seaside bars and a gas station.Satellite images revealed many of the island\'s residential zones had been left in ruins.The hurricane passed over Necker Island, also causing severe damage and destroying the mansion of Richard Branson.\n\nMost homes and businesses were destroyed on the island of Jost Van Dyke, the smallest of the B.V.I.\'s four main islands.The Governor, Gus Jaspert, who had only been sworn into office 13 days previously, declared a state of emergency - the first time this has ever happened in the Territory.After the storm, restoration of electricity took approximately 5 months.\n\nIrma\'s effects in the U.S. Virgin Islands were most profound on Saint Thomas, where at least of rain fell, and on Saint John.Saint Thomas island suffered widespread structural damage, including to its police station and airport.Patients from the fourth and third floors of Charlotte Amalie\'s hospital had to be relocated to lower floors due to flooding from roof leaks.Three deaths were attributed to Irma on the island.On nearby Saint Croix, there were communication issues and some damage to the infrastructure.Saint John lost access to ferry and cargo services, along with access to the local airport.Due to its normal reliance on electricity from Saint Thomas, the island was left without power.Total damage from the three islands was at least $1.1 billion.\n\nThe hurricane passed north of Puerto Rico, but still caused significant damage to the United States territory.Along the coast, a tide gauge observed waves up to mean higher high water.Much of the main island experienced sustained tropical storm force winds, with a peak sustained wind speed of at a weather station along San Juan Bay, while the same site observed a peak wind gust of .However, on the island of Culebra, a wind gust of was reported.Mainly due to strong winds, approximately 1.1 million out of 1.5 million of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority\'s customers lost electricity.Portions of Puerto Rico received heavy rainfall, with a peak total of in Bayamón, causing seven rivers to reach flood stage, widespread flash flooding, and at least six landslides.\n\nThe most severely affected areas included the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques, as well as the northeastern, northern, and mountainous portions of the main island.On Culebra, the island suffered an almost complete loss of electrical and water services.At least 30 homes on the island were destroyed, while about 30 other experienced substantial damage.High winds also toppled a number of trees.The only telecommunications tower on Culebra sustained damage, cutting off outside communications for several hours.In rural Loíza, 79 homes were destroyed.Throughout Puerto Rico, 781 out of 1,600 telecommunications towers went out of commission, primarily due to power outages.At least 362,000 customers lost water services.Debris, mostly fallen trees, blocked at least 72 roads.Approximately 25% to 30% of banana, coffee, papaya, and plantain crops were damaged by strong winds, with losses to farmers estimated at $30.6 million.Approximately 1,530 homes experienced at least moderate damage, with 1,448 homes moderately damaged, 32 extensively damaged, and 50 completely destroyed.\n\nHurricane Irma was attributed to around $1 billion in damage, and the NHC attributed three fatalities to Irma in Puerto Rico, though four deaths were related to the storm.Two people died due to rainstorms ahead of the hurricane: one man died in Orocovis after falling off his ladder while repairing his roof; another man on the coast in Capitanejo died after being struck by lightning.Three nearby fishermen were burned by the same lightning strike, but survived.Two other people died during the hurricane: a woman died while being evacuated from her house in a wheelchair and fell, hitting her head; another person died in a car accident in Canóvanas.Governor Ricardo Rosselló declared the islands of Culebra and Vieques to be disaster areas.\n\nAlthough spared a direct hit, both the Dominican Republic and Haiti were affected by high winds and heavy rains.A bridge over the Dajabón River connecting the two countries was broken.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, the fishing community of Nagua sustained damage from waves that destroyed homes.55,000 soldiers were deployed to affected areas to help with the clean-up efforts.By the evening of September 7, the government had counted 2,721 damaged homes.\n\nIn Haiti, flooding one meter deep sat in residential neighborhoods in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives.Mudslides, destroyed homes, flooded crops, and infrastructure damage were reported in the northern part of the country.The total expanse of the flooding stretched from Môle-Saint-Nicolas in the west to the eastern border with the Dominican Republic.\n\nOn the evening of September 7, at 7:30 pm AST (23:30 UTC), Hurricane Irma reached the Turks and Caicos Islands.While the eye passed just south of the main islands, crossing over South Caicos and the Ambergris Cays, the most powerful winds on the northern side of the eye swept all of the islands for more than two hours.Communications infrastructure was destroyed.\n\nOn September 8, Minister of Infrastructure Goldray Ewing confirmed that damage to Providenciales was extensive, with the northwestern neighborhood of Blue Hill being ""gone"".The hospital in the capital, Cockburn Town, was heavily damaged.On South Caicos, 75% of roofs were lost.Total damage was estimated at over $500 million.\n\nIn the Bahamas, the eye of the storm passed over Duncan Town, the major settlement of the Ragged Islands chain, on September 8.It also passed ""almost directly over"" Inagua and South Acklins, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.\n\nDamages were largely confined to the southern islands starting the morning of September 8.On Mayaguana and Great Inagua, downed power lines knocked out communications.On Great Inagua, 70% of homes sustained roof damage, and the island\'s school lost its roof entirely.The Morton Salt Company\'s signature production facility, one of the major employers in the country, experienced millions of dollars in damages.The Acklins settlement of Salina Point was cut off from the rest of the island by flooding, while Crooked Island had widespread roof damage.In the northern Bahamas, the worst property damage came on September 10 as the outer bands of the system produced tornadic activity on Grand Bahama and Bimini.Damage and losses across The Bahamas amounted to $135 million.\n\nWhile Irma was making landfall in Florida, the ocean was drawn away from some western shorelines of the Bahamas due to strong easterly winds.\n\nEarly on September 9, Irma made landfall on the Camagüey Archipelago off the northern coast of Cuba, with sustained winds of .The strongest official sustained wind speed was , while the highest wind gust reached ; both were observed near Camila in Ciego de Ávila Province.The weather station at Esmeralda, Camagüey, was damaged, with the wind gauge destroyed.The north coast of Cuba experienced significant coastal flooding due to storm surge and abnormally high tides generated by the storm.Wave heights at Cayo Romano exceeded .Storm surge penetrated as far as inland in some areas of Villa Clara Province.Multiple locations on the island observed at least of rainfall, with a peak total of of precipitation at Topes de Collantes.\n\nA total of 158,554 homes experienced some degree of damage, of which 14,657 were destroyed; approximately 1.9 million people experienced the direct effects of Irma.The storm partially deroofed 103,691 homes, while 23,560 were completely deroofed.Irma damaged or destroyed 980 health facilities and 2,264 schools.Approximately 3.1 million people experienced disruptions to the water supply, while 246,707 people lost telephone service.About of roads were damaged.Crops also suffered extensively, with nearly affected by the storm.Throughout the country, the hurricane inflicted $13.185 billion in damage and killed 10 people, making Irma the costliest tropical cyclone in Cuban history.\n\nThe tourist areas of Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and Cayo Santa María and the nearby town of Caibarién received the brunt of the storm, with waves rolling through town and the characteristic one-story homes completely flooded.The storm most severely Ciego de Ávila and Villa Clara provinces.Flooding worsened as the hurricane moved west, pushing the storm surge along to the regions around Havana.By the afternoon, limited flooding was occurring in Havana, including around the Malecón.Portions of province coastal flooding surpassing that which was experienced during the Storm of the Century in 1993 and Hurricane Wilma in 2005.In the city of Santa Clara, 39 buildings collapsed.Rainfall resulted in several rivers reaching major flood stage.The town of Cabaiguán in Sancti Spíritus Province in particular suffered extensive inland flooding after the Zaza River swelled.\n\nHurricane Irma directly affected a major colony of American flamingos on Cuba\'s northern Cayo Coco.Early reports from Diario de Cuba indicated that several hundred flamingos had been killed by the storm, though other estimates ranged as high as several thousand birds.\n\nHurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida.Except for the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned.Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba, but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys.The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States.After surveying the aftermath of Irma, Florida governor Rick Scott said ""I thought we would see more damage""[on the mainland] but said ""he witnessed devastation in the Keys"".President Donald Trump commented on Twitter that the devastation in some places was ""far greater than anyone thought"".\n\nDamage in the United States was estimated at a minimum of $50 billion.At the time, Irma was the fourth costliest tropical cyclone in the United States, behind hurricanes Sandy in 2012, Harvey earlier that year, and Katrina in 2005.However, later in September 2017, Hurricane Maria became the third costliest United States tropical cyclone, causing Irma to fall to the fifth costliest.At least 92 people, 10 directly and 82 indirectly, died throughout the United States in relation to Irma: 84 in Florida, 3 in Georgia, 3 in South Carolina, and 2 in North Carolina.\n\nIrma struck the state less than two weeks after Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten had caused the worst flooding seen in western Florida in 20 years, which further worsened the impacts in the region.The storm\'s large wind field resulted in strong winds across much of Florida, except for the western Panhandle.The highest reported sustained wind speed was on Marco Island, while the strongest observed wind gust was , recorded near Naples, though wind gusts of likely occurred in the Middle Florida Keys.More than 7.7 million homes and businesses in Florida were left without electricity at some point – approximately 73% of state.Generally heavy amounts of rainfall were recorded to the east of the Irma\'s path, including a peak total of in Fort Pierce.Heavy precipitation – and storm surge, in some instances – overflowed at least 32 rivers and creeks, causing significant flooding, particularly along the St. Johns River and its tributaries.Many homes and businesses suffered damage or destruction, with more than 65,000 structures damaged to some degree in West Central and Southwest Florida alone.Agriculture experienced about $2.5 billion in damage.It was estimated that the cyclone caused at least $50 billion in damage, making Irma the costliest hurricane in Florida history, surpassing Hurricane Andrew, until it was itself surpassed by Hurricane Ian, 5 years later.\n\nThroughout Florida, at least 84 people died in storm-related incidents.About half of the deaths occurred from drowning, trauma, and carbon monoxide poisoning.Broward County had 21 fatalities, the most of any county in Florida.Among those deaths were 12 people at The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, a Hollywood nursing home.The patients died from sweltering heat worsened by the lack of air conditioning.The hurricane also left at least 14 deaths in Monroe County; 6 deaths in Orange County; 5 deaths each in Duval, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties; 4 deaths in both Highlands and Hillsborough counties; 3 deaths in both Marion and Polk counties; 2 deaths each in Collier, Hardee, Leon, Pinellas, St. Lucie, and Taylor counties; and 1 death in Hendry, Lake, Lee, Liberty, Manatee, Nassau, Okeechobee, Pasco, Seminole, St. Johns, and Volusia counties.\n\nWith Irma making landfall in Monroe County as a Category 4 hurricane, the Florida Keys were hardest hit area in the state.Strong winds and storm surge flooding caused major damage to buildings, trailer parks, boats, roads, the electricity supply, mobile phone coverage, internet access, sanitation, the water supply and the fuel supply throughout the island chain.An estimated storm surge occurred at Cudjoe Key, where Irma made landfall.Throughout the island, 625 homes sustained minor damage, 52 sustained major damage, and 81 were demolished.On Big Pine Key, one of the most devastated islands, 633 homes received minor impact, 299 homes received major impact, and 473 homes were completely destroyed.Overall in Monroe County, 27,649 homes experienced some degree of damage, including 1,179 homes being destroyed, 2,977 homes receiving major damage, and 5,361 suffering minor damage.\n\nAfter devastating the Keys, the storm then struck Collier County as a Category 3 hurricane.Several communities in the county suffered extensive damage, especially along the coast.Throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, 65 homes, including 44 mobile homes, were demolished, while 1,008 homes received major damage.Property damages in unincorporated areas alone reach about $320 million.Lee County was lashed by strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused prolonged flooding in some areas.More than 24,000 homes suffered some degree of damage, with almost 3,000 homes receiving major damage and 89 homes being destroyed.Damage in the county totaled about $857 million.\n\nImpact in much of the Miami metropolitan area was generally limited to extensive tree and fence damage, as well as widespread power outages.However, in Miami-Dade County, about 1,000 homes received major damage and about 50% of crops were lost.Storm surge caused coastal flooding from Homestead to Downtown Miami, as well as in portions of Miami Beach.Parts of the Florida Heartland were devastated by high winds and flooding, particularly Hendry and Highlands counties.In the former, which has most citrus trees of any county in Florida, about 60% of orange crops were lost.Throughout Hendry County, a total of 451 homes had minor damage, 131 homes suffered major damage, and 42 others were destroyed.In Highlands County, 13,138 businesses and homes were damaged to some degree, with 144 being destroyed, 963 sustaining major damage, and 2,408 receiving minor damage.In Orange County, wind gusts reached 79 mph at Orlando International Airport.A wind gust of 91 mph was also recorded in Orlando at the top of the Disney Contemporary Resort.Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central Florida left some wind damage and flooding, necessitating evacuations and rescues, including more than 200 people in Orlo Vista after hundreds of homes were flooded.A total of 2,999 business or homes were damaged in Lake County, 7,430 in Seminole County, and 3,457 in Volusia County.Additionally, eight tornadoes touched down in Brevard County, all of which caused damage.\n\nAlong much of the Gulf Coast of Florida, to the north of where Irma made landfall, negative storm surges were observed, with water retracting rather than pushing inland, causing little coastal flooding.However, on the opposite coast, extensive erosion and storm surge flooding occurred in the First Coast, especially in Duval and St. Johns counties.In Duval County, the St. Johns River crested at heights that exceeded records set during Hurricane Dora in 1964.Portions of Jacksonville experienced flooding, particularly the downtown area and the Riverside and San Marco neighborhoods, with about 350 people rescued in those sections of the city.Water reached about high in some homes.The city of Jacksonville suffered about $85 million in damage.\n\nIn St. Johns County, storm surge left extensive damage to oceanfront properties in Ponte Vedra Beach and Vilano Beach, with several becoming uninhabitable.Additionally, some riverfront businesses in St. Augustine\'s historic district were flooded due to storm surge from the Matanzas River.In nearby Clay County, rainfall and storm surge combined to cause extensive flooding along portions of the Black Creek and the St. Johns River, with record high crests at several locations along the former.About 350 people and 75 animals were rescued from floodwaters throughout the county.A total of 275 homes were destroyed, 175 were inflicted major damage, and 124 received minor damage.\n\nThree deaths were reported in Georgia due to falling trees and debris, along with widespread wind damage and power outages throughout the state primarily due to fallen trees.On Tybee Island, as well as St. Simons Island the storm surge caused extensive flooding.The tropical storm also did $54 million in damage in the state.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the third highest storm surge on record was recorded, reaching a height of approximately .By of September 12, almost 100,000 had lost power in Upstate South Carolina.Five people died in storm-related incidents across South Carolina, all from indirect incidents.The tropical storm caused damages totaling $500,000 in the state.\n\nLight damage occurred in other areas, including Tennessee.About 75,000 customers in North Carolina lost power due to Irma.It also caused $600,000 in damages in Alabama.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Irma\'s path through the West Indies and Caribbean, the devastation to roads, harbors and airports significantly impeded the transportation and distribution of relief supplies.Foreign countries moved to provide much of the initial aid.The British, Dutch, French, and United States governments sent warships and planes with supplies and manpower to the region.International leaders, including Dutch King Willem-Alexander and French President Emmanuel Macron, quickly moved to visit affected territories.\n\nSome of the affected countries and territories also offered assistance to each other.Cuba, which sustained extensive damage from the storm, sent 750 health workers to Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, Dominica, and Haiti.Government officials and members of the public in Puerto Rico delivered assistance and evacuated people stranded on other islands.The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services granted special 30-day humanitarian visas for British Virgin Islanders to stay in Puerto Rico.Hundreds of people stranded on Saint Martin were flown to the Dominican Republic on humanitarian grounds.\n\nIn response to Hurricane Jose\'s approach, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a mandatory evacuation on September 9 for any remaining residents on Barbuda.A Miami cargo plane landed on Antigua later that day, carrying over 60 tons (120,000 lbs) of relief supplies for the displaced storm victims—including bottled water, canned food and power generators.\n\nRFA Mounts Bay stationed itself near Anguilla and provided support and relief work to the island with its helicopters and 40 marines and army engineers.The ship delivered 6 tonnes of emergency aid to Anguilla and army engineers repaired a fuel leak at Anguilla\'s main petrol dump, restored power to the island\'s hospital and provided shelters for those left homeless by the hurricane.The ship arrived in the British Virgin Islands on September 8, 2017, to provide emergency relief to the islands, including providing shelters, food and water.HMS Ocean was diverted from the Mediterranean to provide relief from Gibraltar to the affected British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos on September 7, and aid was also supplied by the Department for International Development from their disaster response centre at Kemble Airfield.As part of a £32 million operation named Operation Ruman, nearly 500 UK military personnel with emergency relief were dispatched from RAF Brize Norton.This included the first deployment of No. 38 Expeditionary Air Wing with 3 RAF aircraft; 2 Airbus A400M Atlas and 1 C130J hercules to support relief efforts.\n\nThe British government also drafted 2 members of the UK police calibre into the region on September 10, and 53 police officers were drafted from RAF Brize Norton to the affected British Overseas Territories on September 15 to help maintain order.UK politicians, including the chairs of the foreign affairs and development select committees, criticized both the government\'s preparations for the storm and its response as inadequate.\n\nBy September 12, the Department for International Development had delivered more than 40 tonnes of aid into the region, including into Turks and Caicos, and 1,000 UK military troops were deployed in the region as part of relief efforts.The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, pledged an additional £25 million worth of funding as part of relief efforts in the region on September 13, 2017, and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Boris Johnson, said that a further 250 UK military personnel would be deployed into the area within the next few days.Anguilla\'s Chief Minister, Victor Banks, praised the British government\'s response to the storm and said that Boris Johnson\'s visit to the island ""sends a very positive signal to Anguillans that the British are serious about their response to this very severe hurricane"", but went on to say that the current financial commitment from the UK was not substantial enough.\n\nBy September 15, the United Kingdom had over 70 military personnel and 4 police officers in Anguilla and had delivered 15 tonnes of aid to the island.In the British Virgin Islands, Royal Marines had cleared the airfield so that it was operational for the delivery of aid into the islands, with more than 200 British military personnel and 54 UK police officers on the ground and 8 tonnes of aid delivered to the islands.120 British military personnel were on the ground in Turks and Caicos, and over 150 shelter kits and 720 liters of water were delivered to the islands on September 15.\n\nAmendments to international aid rules by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (or OECD) allowed for the UK government to provide access to £13 billion worth of aid to the affected British Overseas Territories, through the UK\'s Official Development Assistance (ODA) by November 2017.\n\nBy the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage.The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by Irma\'s eye, remained largely inaccessible for days.Assessments showed that 15% of the national telecommunications network had been affected, with at least one tower destroyed.Bahamasair resumed a limited domestic schedule on September 10, with international flights still cancelled due to existing and anticipated destruction at other destinations.\n\nThe worst devastation occurred on Ragged Island, over which Irma\'s eye had directly passed.After days of the National Emergency Management Agency not being able to physically reach the island, officials were finally able to inspect it; they promptly declared it uninhabitable.Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said that it was the worst disaster area he or his officials had ever seen, and that all remaining residents would need to leave, potentially permanently.Business leaders and other officials called for a new long-term development model to shift the population away from such sparsely-settled islands.\n\nOn Grand Bahama and Bimini, where tornadoes associated with Irma touched down on September 10, more than 100 people were left displaced.Infrastructure damage included docks, parks, and the power system.\n\nAside from tangible asset losses, Irma brought significant economic damages.International freight shipping was projected to be offline for a week, and costs for rebuilding supplies were inflated due to demand in the U.S.\n\nSwollen rivers contributed to worsening flooding in the days after the storm system left, resulting in additional evacuations.Officials resorted to using inflatable rafts to access affected areas.The national electrical infrastructure was said to be extensively damaged.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, flooding worsened following Irma\'s departure, leading the number of displaced persons to increase to more than 24,000 by September 8.President Danilo Medina ordered further evacuations due to at-risk dams, while the government banned swimming in rivers and ordered boats kept in port.More than 422,000 people were left without water due to 28 aqueducts being damaged.\n\nIn Haiti, officials stated that losses were greater than they could have been since people largely did not heed early preparation and evacuation warnings.At least 5,000 homes were flooded.One man died trying to cross a flooded river; another went missing and 17 were injured.The trash- and waste-contaminated floodwaters in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives led to fears of cholera outbreaks.Flooding continued to worsen days after the storm, as runoff from the mountains swelled rivers in low-lying farming communities.United Nations peacekeepers from Brazil were able to gain access to the flooded northwest region to provide urgent aid, but non-governmental organizations and Haitian economists warned that the estimated 30,000 victims would need longer-term assistance as well.Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant appointed a government commission to address Irma\'s effects, with Action Against Hunger in charge of humanitarian coordination.\n\nIn the USVI, residents and tourists alike were described as being in a state of traumatic shock.By September 7, the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship had arrived in the USVI to provide supplies, damage assessment, and evacuation assistance.Four additional warships, some of which had already been on their way to Texas to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief, were redirected to the region.At a September 10 news conference, Governor Kenneth Mapp described Irma as a ""horrific disaster"" for which ""[t]here will be no restorations or solutions in days or weeks.""The Federal Emergency Management Agency airlifted in goods for residents, who were subjected to a curfew.Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line agreed to transport tourists to Florida, contingent upon port availability following the state\'s own experience with Irma.\n\nOn Saint John, described as ""perhaps the site of Irma\'s worst devastation on American soil,"" it took six days for an active-theater disaster zone to be established, leading to criticism of the U.S. government response.The National Guard was delayed in reaching Saint John due to the number of overturned boats left in the harbor.The National Guard was brought in to maintain order, while the Coast Guard brought evacuees to cruise ships bound for San Juan and Miami.There was still no electricity on St. John in the middle of October 2017.\n\nBy September 9, more than one million Puerto Ricans were still without power, tens of thousands were without water, and several thousand were still in shelters.Hospitals were operating on generator power.The government was struggling to establish contact with the islands of Culebra and Vieques.By September 10, the main island had recovered enough to serve as a refuge for people stranded on other islands, including 1,200 tourists from Saint Martin and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Airlifts had brought more than 50 patients to Puerto Rico.\n\nFive months after Irma, two-thirds of the hospital beds on Saint Thomas were still unavailable, due to extensive physical damage and staffing shortages.\n\nDamage to Sint Maarten\'s harbour and to Princess Juliana International Airport left the Dutch part of Saint Martin unreachable, although the smaller Grand Case-Espérance Airport on the French side could be reopened by September 7 for supply aid by helicopter and airplane.The French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops on board a CASA/IPTN CN-235 aircraft.\n\nThe following day, the Dutch military was able to airlift dialysis patients off the island while also dropping leaflets to warn islanders about the rapidly approaching Hurricane Jose.Although the airport was closed, 435 students and faculty of the American University of the Caribbean were evacuated by the U.S. military.On September 10, Dutch King Willem-Alexander departed for the region, with intentions to visit Sint Maarten and other affected Dutch territories and commonwealth members.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron followed this announcement by stating his intentions to visit the French part of the island on September 12 in order to bring aid supplies.In response to criticism of the French handling of the disaster, 1,000 troops, police, and other emergency workers were sent to Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.\n\nOn both sides of Saint Martin, desperate conditions combined with food and water shortages in Irma\'s aftermath led to reports of violence, scavenging, and theft.In response, the French government increased its troop deployment to 2,200 and the Dutch government sent more than 600 military and police personnel.\n\nThe day after the hurricane hit Saint Barthelemy the French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops into the reopened Grand Case-Espérance Airport.On September 7 and 9, equipment and personnel were flown from France to Guadeloupe and Martinique.\n\nSporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm.\n\nOn September 11, Florida Governor Rick Scott conducted an aerial tour to survey the damage to the Keys.The Overseas Highway remained closed while authorities assessed the integrity of the 42 bridges along the route.Residents returning to the Keys were faced with a police roadblock, to the south of Florida City.USS Iwo Jima, USS New York and aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were sent to the Keys area to aid with the recovery.\n\nOn September 12, some residents were allowed to return into the Keys as far as Islamorada.Although road damage blocked entry any farther than Islamorada, bridges had been inspected and found safe to Sugarloaf Key.By late on September 12, the Overseas Highway had been repaired and the bridges inspected as safe for first responders to travel to Key West.On September 16, residents were free to return to Marathon.Residents were allowed to return to Key West the following day, although the Keys remained closed to tourists and a checkpoint remained in place in Florida City.\n\nDue mainly to the widespread loss of power, cell phone service was also reduced after battery backup power for cell phone towers ran out and backup generators ran out of fuel.In an impact report by the FCC, as of 11 AM EDT on September 12, 89 of 108 (82%) cell phone towers were non-functioning in Monroe County (Florida Keys), 154 of 212 (73%) were non-functioning in Collier County (Naples), 36 of 46 (78%) were non-functioning in Hendry County, and an additional six counties had 41-60% of cell phone towers not functioning, including Lee County (Fort Myers) and Miami-Dade County.\n\nNOAA released map-format aerial reconnaissance image data of damage from the storm.The imagery featured several areas of Florida: including the Florida Keys, the southwest coast of Florida from Marco Island to Punta Gorda, much of the northeast coast of Florida, and portions of the Jacksonville area.Portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts were also photographed.Additionally, the Sun-Sentinel published before and after photos of several landmarks in the Florida Keys.\n\nIn the days after the hurricane, due to the heavy rainfall, numerous rivers had flooded, including residential areas.Public health risks, such as diarrheal infections and mosquito-borne illnesses, remain from the flooding that resulted in the aftermath of the hurricane.A large concern from flooding is contamination because people become exposed to dirty floodwaters and the potential for contaminated water to enter the local water supply is significant.One example of an illness that can enter the water supply is leptospirosis, which is rat urine carries into the floodwaters.Untreated exposure to leptospirosis can cause kidney damage, meningitis, and liver failure.Noroviruses and other infections are also a risk.\n\nFollowing Irma\'s passage, a hand-carved wooden canoe was discovered on the banks of the Indian River and could be several hundred years old.The state has removed the canoe for examination and safe keeping.\n\nDue to Irma\'s and Hurricane Harvey\'s impact in Florida and Texas, U.S. employment declined in September 2017 for the first time since September 2010.The leisure and hospitality industries were especially hard hit, losing 111,000 jobs in September.\n\nIrma set multiple records for intensity, especially at easterly longitudes, time spent at such an intensity, and its intensity at landfall.When Irma reached Category 5 intensity with winds of at 11:45 UTC on September 5 at 57.7°W, it became the easternmost Atlantic hurricane of this strength on record, surpassing Hurricane David of 1979, later beaten by Hurricane Lorenzo 2 years later.By 00:15 UTC on September 6, Irma reached peak intensity with () winds and a minimum pressure of .This ties it with Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and Hurricane Rita of 2005 as the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed.Only five other Atlantic hurricanes have been recorded with wind speeds higher than Irma: Hurricane Allen of 1980, which had maximum sustained winds of , and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Gilbert of 1988, Hurricane Wilma of 2005, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, all of which had peak winds of .At the time, Irma was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; later surpassed by Hurricane Dorian, and was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007.In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category 5 strength winds, and the third-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, with a value of 64.9 units.Only the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane and Hurricane Ivan in 2004 achieved higher values.\n\nOn September 6, Irma made landfall on the islands of Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Virgin Gorda at peak strength.This ties Irma with cyclones Monica of 2006 and Winston of 2016, and typhoons Zeb of 1998 and Megi of 2010 as the seventh-strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall globally – in terms of sustained winds – trailing only Typhoon Goni of 2020 which bore winds of at landfall, Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 and Typhoon Meranti of 2016, which bore winds of at landfall, and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Typhoon Joan of 1959, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, which bore winds of at landfall.Irma is second to the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin, and is the first hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic at Category 5 status since Felix in 2007.Irma is the first recorded Category 5 hurricane to affect the northern Leeward Islands, and was one of the worst storms to hit the region on record, along with Hurricane Donna in 1960 and Hurricane Luis in 1995.In addition, Irma is only the second hurricane on record to make landfall in Cuba at Category 5 intensity, with the other being a hurricane in 1924.Furthermore, when Irma made landfall on Barbuda, Saint Martin, Virgin Gorda, and Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane, it became one of only two recorded Atlantic storms to make landfall in multiple nations at this strength; the other was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which struck both Eleuthera and the United States as a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nIrma made landfall in the Florida Keys with winds of and a pressure of , making it the strongest hurricane to strike Florida in terms of wind speed since Charley in 2004, and the most intense to strike the state in terms of barometric pressure since Andrew in 1992.In the span of two weeks, two Category 4 hurricanes—Harvey and Irma—struck the continental United States, the first time on record two Atlantic tropical cyclones of such strength made landfall on the country in the same hurricane season.This also marked only the third occurrence of two consecutive Atlantic storms making landfall in the United States as major hurricanes.The other two instances were the Great Charleston and Cheniere Caminada hurricanes in 1893, and hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne in 2004.\n\nBecause of the extensive damage and loss of life the hurricane caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Irma from its rotating naming lists in April 2018, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane.It was replaced with Idalia for the 2023 season.\n\nWeather of 2017 Tropical cyclones in 2017 List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes Operation RUMAN – UK military-civil disaster relief response to Hurricane Irma.List of Cuba hurricanes List

38,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Hurricane Irma', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'Hurricane Irma was an extremely powerful Cape Verde hurricane that caused widespread destruction across its path in early September 2017.Irma was the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the Leeward Islands on record, followed by Maria two weeks later.At the time, it was considered the most powerful hurricane on record in the open Atlantic region, outside of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, until it was surpassed by Hurricane Dorian two years later.It was also the third-strongest Atlantic hurricane at landfall ever recorded, just behind the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane and Dorian.The ninth named storm, fourth hurricane, second major hurricane, and first Category 5 hurricane of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Irma caused widespread and catastrophic damage throughout its long lifetime, particularly in the northeastern Caribbean and the Florida Keys.It was also the most intense hurricane to strike the continental United States since Katrina in 2005, the first major hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Wilma in the same year, and the first Category 4 hurricane to strike the state since Charley in 2004.The word Irmageddon was coined soon after the hurricane to describe the damage caused by the hurricane.\n\nIrma developed from a tropical wave near the Cape Verde Islands on August 30.Favorable conditions allowed Irma to rapidly intensify into a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson wind scale by late on August 31.The storm\'s intensity fluctuated between Categories 2 and 3 for the next several days, due to a series of eyewall replacement cycles.On September 4, Irma resumed intensifying, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by early on the next day.Early on September 6, Irma peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of and a minimum pressure of .Irma was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017 in terms of barometric pressure, and the strongest worldwide in 2017 in terms of wind speed.Another eyewall replacement cycle caused Irma to weaken back to a Category 4 hurricane, but the storm re-attained Category 5 status before making landfall in Cuba.Although Irma briefly weakened to a Category 2 storm while making landfall on Cuba, the system re-intensified to Category 4 status as it crossed the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, before making landfall on Cudjoe Key on September 10.Irma then weakened to Category 3 status, prior to another landfall in Florida on Marco Island later that day.The system degraded into a remnant low over Alabama and ultimately dissipated on September 13 over Missouri.\n\nThe storm caused catastrophic damage in Barbuda, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Anguilla, and the Virgin Islands as a Category 5 hurricane.The hurricane caused at least 134 deaths: one in Anguilla; one in Barbados; three in Barbuda; four in the British Virgin Islands; 10 in Cuba; 11 in the French West Indies; one in Haiti; three in Puerto Rico; four on the Dutch side of Sint Maarten; 92 in the contiguous United States, and four in the U.S. Virgin Islands.Hurricane Irma was the top Google searched term in the U.S. and globally in 2017.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa on August 26.The tropical wave moved off the coast of the continent late on August 27.Throughout the next two days, showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low-pressure area, as the system passed just south of and then through the Cape Verde Islands on August 29.Around 00:00 UTC on the following day, the system developed into a tropical depression just west of the Cape Verde Islands.Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Irma, based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates.With warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, strengthening was anticipated, with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier air.\n\nThe nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow, as an anticyclone became established over the system, with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images.Early on August 31, shortly after the development of a central dense overcast (CDO) and an eye feature, Irma underwent rapid intensification, becoming a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 UTC and then a Category 3 hurricane, becoming a major hurricane – around 00:00 UTC on September 1.Within a 48-hour period, the hurricane\'s intensity had increased by .On September 2, a ship passed to the west of the center of Irma, recording maximum winds of , which indicated that the eye of Irma remained compact.A strong high pressure system to the north of Irma caused the storm to move west-southwestward between September 2 and September 4.The first aircraft reconnaissance mission departed from Barbados on the afternoon of September 3, discovering an eye in diameter and surface winds of .\n\nOn September 4, after moving into more favorable conditions, Irma strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane.As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by 12:00 UTC on the following day, with winds of .The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at near 18:00 UTC on September 5. Irma acquired annular characteristics around this time, with the storm exhibiting a large, symmetric CDO and an impressive satellite appearance.Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern Leeward Islands.Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of Barbuda at peak intensity, with the storm\'s central minimum pressure having bottomed out at – this was the lowest in the Atlantic since Dean in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of .Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15 UTC on Sint Maarten, and at 16:30 UTC on Virgin Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands, though the storm\'s central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall.\n\nAs the hurricane moved away from the Virgin Islands late on September 6, observations from reconnaissance flights, as well as Doppler radar in San Juan, Puerto Rico, indicated an elliptical eye and double eyewalls.Late on September 6, the cyclone passed about north of Puerto Rico.Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of Hispaniola throughout the day on September 7.After beginning an eyewall replacement cycle, Irma weakened to a Category 4 hurricane as it passed south of the Turks and Caicos Islands early on September 8.This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category 5 intensity, the second-longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above – behind only the 1932 Cuba hurricane.At 05:00 UTC on September 8, Irma made landfall on the island of Little Inagua in the Bahamas with sustained winds of .The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a subtropical ridge to its north.Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category 5 intensity at 18:00 UTC that day east of Cuba as deep convection became more pronounced and organized.The hurricane then made landfall in Cayo Romano, Cuba, at 03:00 UTC on September 9, with winds of .This made Irma only the second Category 5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the 1924 Cuba hurricane.As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category 2 storm later on September 9.\n\nAfter slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards Florida around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental United States.Moving over the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, Irma quickly restrengthened to a Category 4 hurricane at 06:00 UTC on September 10, as deep convection improved and the eye became better defined.In addition, Irma\'s wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of and gale-force winds spanning in diameter.The cyclone made landfall in Cudjoe Key, Florida, at 13:00 UTC on September 10, at Category 4 intensity, with winds of .Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category 3 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30 UTC, in Marco Island, Florida, with sustained winds of .Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category 3 intensity hours after landfall.Passing east of Tampa as a weakening Category 1 hurricane around 06:00 UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation – though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds.The system finally weakened to a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC that day as it entered southern Georgia, while acquiring some extratropical characteristics.At 06:00 UTC on September 12, Irma degenerated to a remnant low just as it entered Alabama, as most of the deep convection had diminished.The remnants persisted for another day or so before dissipating over Missouri on September 13.\n\nGiven that Irma\'s forecast track was along much of the Caribbean island chain, hurricane warnings were issued for the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and parts of Hispaniola on September 5.\n\nIn Antigua and Barbuda, residents safeguarded their homes and cleaned up their properties in anticipation of strong winds.Emergency crews were put on standby at public shelters and hospitals by September 5 to assist with any evacuations.Expecting a direct hit, more than half of the residents on Barbuda took shelter, and relief supplies were preemptively mobilized.The National Emergency Management Organization on Saint Lucia urged small craft operators and swimmers to be mindful of forecasts for high surf.Small Craft Warnings and High Surf Advisories were hoisted for Dominica, where residents were urged to remain vigilant of the potential for high waves, landslides, and flooding.\n\nIn Guadeloupe, low-lying and cliff-edge homes were evacuated at the threat of flooding and erosion.Schools and public businesses closed on September 5 and 6.Hospitals stocked up on three days\' worth of supplies and checked the functionality of their generators.Of the island\'s 32 communes, 22 activated their emergency plans; 1,500 people were urged to take shelter.The island sustained relatively minor damage and became the base for relief efforts on Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.Though the core of the hurricane was expected to remain north of the island, a yellow alert was issued for Martinique due to the likelihood of rough seas.The island dispatched relief supplies and military reinforcements to its neighboring islands of Guadeloupe, Saint Martin.and Saint Barthélemy, which faced a greater risk of a direct impact.\n\nOn September 4, Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency.By September 6, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency had deployed response teams in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.Supplies, including food rations, medical supplies, and blankets, were pre-staged in strategic locations on the islands for distribution.\n\nOn September 5, the Dominican Republic activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage; the United States and Haiti followed suit two days later.According to officials, 11,200 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas prior to the storm\'s arrival.Approximately 7,400 tourists were moved to Santo Domingo, away from beach resorts.In Haiti, government officials and aid organizations struggled with early preparation and evacuation efforts.While some officials blamed reluctance and indifference on the part of the population, others ""admitted they were not prepared for the onslaught and no mandatory evacuation orders were in place ahead of Irma\'s approach.""Local officials contended that they had not received promised funds, supplies, or equipment from the national government.The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti prepared its 1,000 peacekeepers and engineers to assist.\n\nIn the Turks and Caicos, evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas starting September 5. Schools were closed, government buildings were boarded up, and shelters were opened.Officials spread warnings to residents in English, Creole, and Spanish via social media, radio, SMS text, and WhatsApp.In The Bahamas, the government began preparations the week prior to the hurricane\'s arrival, including securing national sports facilities to use as shelters.By September 7, the government had evacuated 1,609 people by air from the southern islands, including 365 from Bimini.Controlled cutting of the power supply to southern and central Bahamian islands was conducted in advance of the storm.Shelters were made available, though usage was low due to most evacuees staying with family on other islands.Of the 2,679 foreign tourists still in The Bahamas on September 7, about 1,200 were being housed at Atlantis Paradise Island, one of the most hurricane-ready structures in the country.\n\nIn Cuba, meteorologists did not initially predict a direct hit.Fuel conservation was enacted in Camagüey Province to ensure that enough would be available during post-storm power outages.The Civil Defense evacuated nearly one million people from low-lying areas, including thousands of Canadian and European tourists in the Jardines del Rey.Dolphins at a Cayo Guillermo resort were evacuated by helicopter.\n\nThe NHC issued several watches and warnings for the Southeastern United States.The first watches and warnings were issued at 15:00 UTC on September 7, which was a hurricane watch from the Jupiter Inlet to Bonita Beach, including the Florida Keys and Lake Okeechobee.The watches and warnings were extended into Georgia and South Carolina on September 9.At 21:00 UTC on that day, the advisories reached their maximum extent, with a hurricane warning covering the entire east coast of the state, the west coast from Indian Pass southward, and the Florida Keys; a hurricane watch was in place from the Florida–Georgia state line to Edisto Beach, South Carolina; and there were two tropical storm warnings, one in Florida from Indian Pass to the Okaloosa–Walton county line and the other from the Florida–Georgia state line to the South Santee River in South Carolina.Watches and warnings were gradually discontinued as Irma moved inland and weakened, with all of them canceled by early on September 12.\n\nOn September 4, Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency.Governor Scott placed 100 members of the Florida National Guard on duty to assist in preparations.All 7,000 troops were ordered to be on duty by September 8.Officials advised residents to stock their hurricane kits.The state coordinated with electrical companies in order for power outages to be restored as quickly as possible, extending resources such as equipment, fuel, and lodging for the approximately 24,000 restoration personnel who had been activated.Governor Scott suspended tolls on all toll roads in Florida, including the turnpike.All state offices in Florida were closed from September 8 to September 11, while public schools, state colleges, and state universities in all 67 counties were closed during the same period.The Florida Department of Education coordinated with school districts as the need for transportation by school buses and opening shelters arose.By September 9, more than 150 state parks were closed.Throughout the state, almost 700 emergency shelters were opened.The shelters collectively housed about 191,764 people, with more than 40% of them staying in a shelter in South Florida.Additionally, more than 60 special needs shelters were opened, which housed more than 5,000 people by September 9.\n\nMany airports across the state, particularly in Central and South Florida, were closed.Nearly 9,000 flights intending to arrive in or depart from Florida were canceled.Along Florida\'s coasts, most seaports were closed or opened with restricted access.For the fifth time in its 45-year history, the Walt Disney World Resort was completely closed due to the storm.Its theme parks, water parks, and Disney Springs were all closed by 9:00 p.m. on September 9 and remained closed until September 12.Other Orlando-area theme parks, including Universal Orlando Resort and SeaWorld Orlando, were also closed.The Kennedy Space Center was closed from September 8 to September 15.\n\nAn estimated 6.5 million Floridians were ordered to evacuate, mostly those living on barrier islands or in coastal areas; in mobile or sub-standard homes; and in low-lying or flood prone areas.Mandatory evacuations were ordered for portions of Brevard, Broward, Citrus, Collier, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Glades, Hendry, Hernando, Indian River, Lee, Martin, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Lucie, Sumter, and Volusia counties.All of Monroe County, where the Florida Keys are located, was placed under a mandatory evacuation.Residents in communities near the southern half of Lake Okeechobee were also ordered to leave.Additionally, voluntary evacuation notices were issued for all or parts of Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Charlotte, Columbia, Desoto, Hardee, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lake, Manatee, Okeechobee, Osceola, and Polk counties.\n\nA record 6.5 million Floridians evacuated, making it the largest evacuation in the state\'s history.Evacuees caused significant traffic congestion on northbound Interstate 95, Interstate 75, and Florida\'s Turnpike, exacerbated by the fact that the entire Florida peninsula was within the cone of uncertainty in the NHC\'s forecast path in the days before the storm, so evacuees from both coasts headed north, as evacuees would not be safer by fleeing to the opposite coast.Fuel was in short supply throughout peninsular Florida during the week before Irma\'s arrival, especially along evacuation routes, leading to hours-long lines at fuel stations and even escorts of fuel trucks by the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nUse of the left shoulder as a lane for moving traffic was allowed on northbound Interstate 75 from Wildwood to the Georgia state line beginning September 8 and on eastbound Interstate 4 from Tampa to State Road 429 near Celebration for a few hours on September 9.It was the first time that the shoulder-use plan, which was introduced at the start of the 2017 hurricane season, was implemented by the state for hurricane evacuations.The shoulder-use plan was implemented in place of labor- and resource-intensive contraflow lane reversal, in which both sides of an interstate highway are used for one direction of traffic.\n\nOfficials from the Environmental Protection Agency, which had been criticized for its response to Hurricane Harvey, took special measures to inspect and secure hazardous materials, especially at Superfund sites.Direct Relief, a disaster relief organization, coordinated with local health centers and provided resources to help facilities on the front lines of Floridian and Puerto Rican communities.\n\nGeorgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency initially for all six coastal counties on September 6, but eventually expanded the declaration to 94 counties south of Atlanta metropolitan area, and then the entire state on September 10.Atlanta was placed under its first-ever tropical storm warning.Governor Deal ordered mandatory evacuations for all areas east of Interstate 95 on September 7, before extending the order to the entirety of Chatham County and low-lying areas west of I-95 on the following day.In total, 540,000 people on the Georgia coast were ordered to leave.Contraflow lane reversal for Interstate 16 took effect on the morning of September 9 from Savannah to Dublin, Georgia.All Georgia state parks were open for free to evacuees, as was the 800-acre camping area at Atlanta Motor Speedway.Reversible HOT lanes on Interstate 75 in Georgia through south metro Atlanta were open 24 hours northbound with no tolls.\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on September 6, with South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster following suit the same day.Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency on September 8 in order to protect Virginia residents and to mobilize resources in support of neighboring states.Officials in New Orleans stated that there would not be much time for preparations if Irma failed to make the projected northward turn, but that South Texas or Florida would not be a good evacuation destination.On September 10, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam issued an executive order allowing medical professionals in other states to practice in Tennessee to aid Hurricane Irma evacuees.This order also allowed pharmacies to give out 14-day supplies of medicine, and gave women and children from outside the state the ability to participate in the Tennessee Department of Health programs.Bristol Motor Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway, and Charlotte Motor Speedway all opened their campgrounds to evacuees free of charge.\n\nIn professional sports, the Miami Dolphins–Tampa Bay Buccaneers game scheduled for September 10 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was postponed to November 19 due to the storm\'s threat.The Dolphins left early for their road game against the Los Angeles Chargers.The Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees moved their September 11–13 series from Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg to Citi Field in Queens.Minor League Baseball\'s Florida State League, Carolina League, and Southern League called off their championship finals and as a result, named their division series winners league co-champions.The Miami FC versus San Francisco Deltas match on September 10 was cancelled so the players and staff could prepare for the storm with their families.The Orlando Pride of the National Women\'s Soccer League rescheduled their September 9 match to September 7. Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer did not have any scheduled home games in September, but was unable to return to training facilities in Orlando due to Hurricane Irma.\n\nIn college football, the UCF Knights-Memphis Tigers game scheduled for September 9 was moved to September 30, replacing UCF\'s game against Maine and Memphis game against Georgia State.UCF also cancelled their game against Georgia Tech on September 16, as UCF\'s stadium hosted the National Guard.The USF Bulls-Connecticut Huskies football game was also cancelled.The Miami Hurricanes–Arkansas State Redwolves game scheduled for September 9 at Centennial Bank Stadium in Arkansas was canceled due to travel concerns for the University of Miami.The Florida Gators-Northern Colorado Bears match in Gainesville scheduled for September 9 was cancelled.The Florida State Seminoles contest against the Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks was canceled on September 8.The Seminoles\' rivalry game with the Hurricanes in Tallahassee, originally scheduled for September 16, was postponed tp October 7.The FIU Panthers game against the Alcorn State Braves was moved up a day and relocated to Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.The Georgia Southern Eagles game against the New Hampshire Wildcats on September 9 was also moved to Legion Field for that day.\n\nAs of September 5, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding was running dangerously low, due to its response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas the previous week, prompting the Trump administration to request an immediate $8 billion in additional funding as Irma approached Florida.Given the rate that current funds are being consumed and the catastrophic damage, the United States Senate almost doubled the requested amount to $15.3 billion, with the understanding that this would only be about 10% of what will be required for responding to Harvey.\n\nHurricane Irma\'s path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating, with landfalls in Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Martin, the Bahamas, Cuba, and the United States, all at major hurricane intensity.Furthermore, the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences.Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria.\n\nThe eyewall of the hurricane moved over Barbuda near its record peak intensity early on September 6; a weather station observed a wind gust of .The same station also recorded a minimum barometric pressure of .The exact state of the island remained unclear for hours after Irma\'s passage, as downed phone lines ceased all communication with nearby islands.Later that afternoon, Prime Minister Gaston Browne surveyed the territory by helicopter, revealing an effectively uninhabitable island.Irma damaged or destroyed 95% of the structures on Barbuda, including its hospital, schools, and both of its hotels; it completely flattened some residential blocks while submerging others.The destruction rendered the island\'s sole airport and much of its infrastructure inoperative—including water and telecommunication services—which further hampered relief efforts.Property damage on Barbuda ranged from $150 million to $300 million.A total of three storm-related deaths were reported on the island.\n\nIn addition to the catastrophic impact on Barbuda\'s human residents, concern turned to the storm\'s effects on the island\'s wildlife.The island\'s only endemic bird, the near-threatened Barbuda warbler, numbered less than 2,000 individuals prior to the hurricane.For some time it was unknown if the warbler survived the hurricane or its aftermath; however within a few months it was confirmed that not only did the species survive, but the most of the birds survived the storm.Barbuda\'s Codrington Lagoon, home to the largest colony of magnificent frigatebirds in the Caribbean, with an estimated 2,500 nesting pairs, was also inundated by the storm surge.\n\nRemaining just outside of Irma\'s strongest windfield, Antigua sustained less severe damage, in the form of leveled roofs and fences, downed power poles and lines, and uprooted trees.Some street flooding also took place in low-lying areas.Three people were treated for minor storm-related injuries.Forensic disaster analysts from the Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM), a Germany-based risk management agency, estimate that economic losses for Antigua and Barbuda will exceed $120 million.\n\nOn the morning of September 6, Irma\'s center crossed the island of Saint Martin while the storm was at peak intensity, sweeping away entire structures, submerging roads and cars, and triggering an island-wide blackout.Irma\'s extreme winds ripped trees out of the ground and sent vehicles and debris from damaged structures scattered across the territory.On the French side of Saint-Martin, entire marinas around Marigot were left in ruins, littered with the stranded remnants of boats that had smashed into each other.A hotel caught on fire, but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze.Another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor.Media images depicted devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds had shattered their windows.Irma killed four people on the French side of the island and injured 50 others, one of whom was in critical condition.As many as 95% of the buildings there were damaged to some degree; 60% of those were totally uninhabitable.Estimates from CEDIM indicate a minimum of $950 million worth of economic losses.Total losses exceeded €3.5 billion (US$4.17 billion).\n\nA similar situation unfolded in Sint Maarten, Saint Martin\'s Dutch half, as intense winds ripped through buildings and lifted vehicles aloft ""as if they were matches"".The hurricane wreaked havoc on Princess Juliana International Airport, with ""huge chunks of the building [strewn] across the runway and a jet bridge snapped in half.""It demolished or severely damaged about 70% of Sint Maarten\'s houses, forcing thousands of residents into public shelters.There were 4 deaths and 23 injuries, 11 of which were serious, in the Dutch territory.Irma is considered the worst natural disaster to hit Sint Maarten; the extent of its damage far exceeded that of any previous hurricane.Total damages were estimated at €2.5 billion (US$2.98 billion).\n\nIrma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the French island of Saint Barthélemy, southeast of Saint Martin.Describing the extent of the destruction, one local compared it to ""a bomb that burned all vegetation,"" while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively ""erased the island from the map"".Violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments, with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation.Streets in the capital of Gustavia were turned into rushing rivers, which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture.The island\'s fire station was inundated with up to of flood waters.With scores of homes and much of the infrastructure destroyed, the majority of the island\'s population was left stranded and without water, electricity or phone service.The associated economic losses could exceed $480 million according to CEDIM\'s analysts.\n\nPreliminary assessments from the French government indicate that Hurricane Irma caused a combined €1.2 billion (US$1.43 billion) in insured losses across the French territories of Saint-Martin and Saint Barts.This total covered private property such as homes, vehicles and businesses (including lost revenue); the extent of the damage to infrastructural and public facilities remains undetermined.Nonetheless, this made Irma one of the costliest natural disasters to hit the French Republic in 50 years.\n\nOn January 30, 2018, roughly five months after Irma, an analysis was published indicating that an anemometer on the island recorded an unofficial gust to before failing.\n\nThe British Overseas Territory of Anguilla saw the eyewall of the storm pass over it on September 6.Many homes and schools were destroyed, and the island\'s only hospital was badly damaged.The devastation was particularly severe in East End, where the winds uprooted scores of trees and power poles and demolished a number of houses.In The Valley, the island\'s capital, the hurricane blew out the windows of government buildings.Rough seas inflicted heavy damage upon several bays and harbors, and a seaside restaurant was completely eradicated.About 90% of roads were left impassable.The island\'s air traffic control tower was damaged, exacerbating the already poor communication with the island.One death was reported on the island.Estimates of losses on the island total at least $190 million.\n\nLarge swells ahead of Irma washed ashore debris and sea life in Castries, Saint Lucia, blocking some roads.Seaside roads were inundated with water.One surfer was killed amid rough surf in Barbados after hitting a reef and breaking his neck.Trees were also destroyed.The hurricane\'s effects, such as violent seas and rattling trees, were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in Guadeloupe.Several houses were damaged.Around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm, leaving several communes in the dark without running water.Overall damage was limited to external parts of houses and trees that were blown onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seas.\n\nSaint Kitts and Nevis endured similar conditions to other islands.Blustery rainstorms triggered scattered power outages and disabled the island\'s water system, but per the International Red Cross, the islands were spared the level of destruction seen elsewhere.Still, Prime Minister Timothy Harris stated that property and infrastructure had sustained ""significant damage.""The Dutch territories of Saba and Sint Eustatius were also struck by the hurricane\'s winds, resulting in infrastructural damage, water shortages and telecommunication outages.Several houses were left uninhabitable.On Saba, the hurricane also defoliated trees and injured a few people.CEDIM\'s analysts expect economic losses of $20–65 million for the two islands.\n\nDamage in the British Virgin Islands was extensive.Numerous buildings and roads were destroyed on the island of Tortola, which bore the brunt of the hurricane\'s core.Four people were confirmed dead.Along Cane Garden Bay, the storm surge submerged several seaside bars and a gas station.Satellite images revealed many of the island\'s residential zones had been left in ruins.The hurricane passed over Necker Island, also causing severe damage and destroying the mansion of Richard Branson.\n\nMost homes and businesses were destroyed on the island of Jost Van Dyke, the smallest of the B.V.I.\'s four main islands.The Governor, Gus Jaspert, who had only been sworn into office 13 days previously, declared a state of emergency - the first time this has ever happened in the Territory.After the storm, restoration of electricity took approximately 5 months.\n\nIrma\'s effects in the U.S. Virgin Islands were most profound on Saint Thomas, where at least of rain fell, and on Saint John.Saint Thomas island suffered widespread structural damage, including to its police station and airport.Patients from the fourth and third floors of Charlotte Amalie\'s hospital had to be relocated to lower floors due to flooding from roof leaks.Three deaths were attributed to Irma on the island.On nearby Saint Croix, there were communication issues and some damage to the infrastructure.Saint John lost access to ferry and cargo services, along with access to the local airport.Due to its normal reliance on electricity from Saint Thomas, the island was left without power.Total damage from the three islands was at least $1.1 billion.\n\nThe hurricane passed north of Puerto Rico, but still caused significant damage to the United States territory.Along the coast, a tide gauge observed waves up to mean higher high water.Much of the main island experienced sustained tropical storm force winds, with a peak sustained wind speed of at a weather station along San Juan Bay, while the same site observed a peak wind gust of .However, on the island of Culebra, a wind gust of was reported.Mainly due to strong winds, approximately 1.1 million out of 1.5 million of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority\'s customers lost electricity.Portions of Puerto Rico received heavy rainfall, with a peak total of in Bayamón, causing seven rivers to reach flood stage, widespread flash flooding, and at least six landslides.\n\nThe most severely affected areas included the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques, as well as the northeastern, northern, and mountainous portions of the main island.On Culebra, the island suffered an almost complete loss of electrical and water services.At least 30 homes on the island were destroyed, while about 30 other experienced substantial damage.High winds also toppled a number of trees.The only telecommunications tower on Culebra sustained damage, cutting off outside communications for several hours.In rural Loíza, 79 homes were destroyed.Throughout Puerto Rico, 781 out of 1,600 telecommunications towers went out of commission, primarily due to power outages.At least 362,000 customers lost water services.Debris, mostly fallen trees, blocked at least 72 roads.Approximately 25% to 30% of banana, coffee, papaya, and plantain crops were damaged by strong winds, with losses to farmers estimated at $30.6 million.Approximately 1,530 homes experienced at least moderate damage, with 1,448 homes moderately damaged, 32 extensively damaged, and 50 completely destroyed.\n\nHurricane Irma was attributed to around $1 billion in damage, and the NHC attributed three fatalities to Irma in Puerto Rico, though four deaths were related to the storm.Two people died due to rainstorms ahead of the hurricane: one man died in Orocovis after falling off his ladder while repairing his roof; another man on the coast in Capitanejo died after being struck by lightning.Three nearby fishermen were burned by the same lightning strike, but survived.Two other people died during the hurricane: a woman died while being evacuated from her house in a wheelchair and fell, hitting her head; another person died in a car accident in Canóvanas.Governor Ricardo Rosselló declared the islands of Culebra and Vieques to be disaster areas.\n\nAlthough spared a direct hit, both the Dominican Republic and Haiti were affected by high winds and heavy rains.A bridge over the Dajabón River connecting the two countries was broken.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, the fishing community of Nagua sustained damage from waves that destroyed homes.55,000 soldiers were deployed to affected areas to help with the clean-up efforts.By the evening of September 7, the government had counted 2,721 damaged homes.\n\nIn Haiti, flooding one meter deep sat in residential neighborhoods in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives.Mudslides, destroyed homes, flooded crops, and infrastructure damage were reported in the northern part of the country.The total expanse of the flooding stretched from Môle-Saint-Nicolas in the west to the eastern border with the Dominican Republic.\n\nOn the evening of September 7, at 7:30 pm AST (23:30 UTC), Hurricane Irma reached the Turks and Caicos Islands.While the eye passed just south of the main islands, crossing over South Caicos and the Ambergris Cays, the most powerful winds on the northern side of the eye swept all of the islands for more than two hours.Communications infrastructure was destroyed.\n\nOn September 8, Minister of Infrastructure Goldray Ewing confirmed that damage to Providenciales was extensive, with the northwestern neighborhood of Blue Hill being ""gone"".The hospital in the capital, Cockburn Town, was heavily damaged.On South Caicos, 75% of roofs were lost.Total damage was estimated at over $500 million.\n\nIn the Bahamas, the eye of the storm passed over Duncan Town, the major settlement of the Ragged Islands chain, on September 8.It also passed ""almost directly over"" Inagua and South Acklins, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.\n\nDamages were largely confined to the southern islands starting the morning of September 8.On Mayaguana and Great Inagua, downed power lines knocked out communications.On Great Inagua, 70% of homes sustained roof damage, and the island\'s school lost its roof entirely.The Morton Salt Company\'s signature production facility, one of the major employers in the country, experienced millions of dollars in damages.The Acklins settlement of Salina Point was cut off from the rest of the island by flooding, while Crooked Island had widespread roof damage.In the northern Bahamas, the worst property damage came on September 10 as the outer bands of the system produced tornadic activity on Grand Bahama and Bimini.Damage and losses across The Bahamas amounted to $135 million.\n\nWhile Irma was making landfall in Florida, the ocean was drawn away from some western shorelines of the Bahamas due to strong easterly winds.\n\nEarly on September 9, Irma made landfall on the Camagüey Archipelago off the northern coast of Cuba, with sustained winds of .The strongest official sustained wind speed was , while the highest wind gust reached ; both were observed near Camila in Ciego de Ávila Province.The weather station at Esmeralda, Camagüey, was damaged, with the wind gauge destroyed.The north coast of Cuba experienced significant coastal flooding due to storm surge and abnormally high tides generated by the storm.Wave heights at Cayo Romano exceeded .Storm surge penetrated as far as inland in some areas of Villa Clara Province.Multiple locations on the island observed at least of rainfall, with a peak total of of precipitation at Topes de Collantes.\n\nA total of 158,554 homes experienced some degree of damage, of which 14,657 were destroyed; approximately 1.9 million people experienced the direct effects of Irma.The storm partially deroofed 103,691 homes, while 23,560 were completely deroofed.Irma damaged or destroyed 980 health facilities and 2,264 schools.Approximately 3.1 million people experienced disruptions to the water supply, while 246,707 people lost telephone service.About of roads were damaged.Crops also suffered extensively, with nearly affected by the storm.Throughout the country, the hurricane inflicted $13.185 billion in damage and killed 10 people, making Irma the costliest tropical cyclone in Cuban history.\n\nThe tourist areas of Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and Cayo Santa María and the nearby town of Caibarién received the brunt of the storm, with waves rolling through town and the characteristic one-story homes completely flooded.The storm most severely Ciego de Ávila and Villa Clara provinces.Flooding worsened as the hurricane moved west, pushing the storm surge along to the regions around Havana.By the afternoon, limited flooding was occurring in Havana, including around the Malecón.Portions of province coastal flooding surpassing that which was experienced during the Storm of the Century in 1993 and Hurricane Wilma in 2005.In the city of Santa Clara, 39 buildings collapsed.Rainfall resulted in several rivers reaching major flood stage.The town of Cabaiguán in Sancti Spíritus Province in particular suffered extensive inland flooding after the Zaza River swelled.\n\nHurricane Irma directly affected a major colony of American flamingos on Cuba\'s northern Cayo Coco.Early reports from Diario de Cuba indicated that several hundred flamingos had been killed by the storm, though other estimates ranged as high as several thousand birds.\n\nHurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida.Except for the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned.Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba, but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys.The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States.After surveying the aftermath of Irma, Florida governor Rick Scott said ""I thought we would see more damage""[on the mainland] but said ""he witnessed devastation in the Keys"".President Donald Trump commented on Twitter that the devastation in some places was ""far greater than anyone thought"".\n\nDamage in the United States was estimated at a minimum of $50 billion.At the time, Irma was the fourth costliest tropical cyclone in the United States, behind hurricanes Sandy in 2012, Harvey earlier that year, and Katrina in 2005.However, later in September 2017, Hurricane Maria became the third costliest United States tropical cyclone, causing Irma to fall to the fifth costliest.At least 92 people, 10 directly and 82 indirectly, died throughout the United States in relation to Irma: 84 in Florida, 3 in Georgia, 3 in South Carolina, and 2 in North Carolina.\n\nIrma struck the state less than two weeks after Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten had caused the worst flooding seen in western Florida in 20 years, which further worsened the impacts in the region.The storm\'s large wind field resulted in strong winds across much of Florida, except for the western Panhandle.The highest reported sustained wind speed was on Marco Island, while the strongest observed wind gust was , recorded near Naples, though wind gusts of likely occurred in the Middle Florida Keys.More than 7.7 million homes and businesses in Florida were left without electricity at some point – approximately 73% of state.Generally heavy amounts of rainfall were recorded to the east of the Irma\'s path, including a peak total of in Fort Pierce.Heavy precipitation – and storm surge, in some instances – overflowed at least 32 rivers and creeks, causing significant flooding, particularly along the St. Johns River and its tributaries.Many homes and businesses suffered damage or destruction, with more than 65,000 structures damaged to some degree in West Central and Southwest Florida alone.Agriculture experienced about $2.5 billion in damage.It was estimated that the cyclone caused at least $50 billion in damage, making Irma the costliest hurricane in Florida history, surpassing Hurricane Andrew, until it was itself surpassed by Hurricane Ian, 5 years later.\n\nThroughout Florida, at least 84 people died in storm-related incidents.About half of the deaths occurred from drowning, trauma, and carbon monoxide poisoning.Broward County had 21 fatalities, the most of any county in Florida.Among those deaths were 12 people at The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, a Hollywood nursing home.The patients died from sweltering heat worsened by the lack of air conditioning.The hurricane also left at least 14 deaths in Monroe County; 6 deaths in Orange County; 5 deaths each in Duval, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties; 4 deaths in both Highlands and Hillsborough counties; 3 deaths in both Marion and Polk counties; 2 deaths each in Collier, Hardee, Leon, Pinellas, St. Lucie, and Taylor counties; and 1 death in Hendry, Lake, Lee, Liberty, Manatee, Nassau, Okeechobee, Pasco, Seminole, St. Johns, and Volusia counties.\n\nWith Irma making landfall in Monroe County as a Category 4 hurricane, the Florida Keys were hardest hit area in the state.Strong winds and storm surge flooding caused major damage to buildings, trailer parks, boats, roads, the electricity supply, mobile phone coverage, internet access, sanitation, the water supply and the fuel supply throughout the island chain.An estimated storm surge occurred at Cudjoe Key, where Irma made landfall.Throughout the island, 625 homes sustained minor damage, 52 sustained major damage, and 81 were demolished.On Big Pine Key, one of the most devastated islands, 633 homes received minor impact, 299 homes received major impact, and 473 homes were completely destroyed.Overall in Monroe County, 27,649 homes experienced some degree of damage, including 1,179 homes being destroyed, 2,977 homes receiving major damage, and 5,361 suffering minor damage.\n\nAfter devastating the Keys, the storm then struck Collier County as a Category 3 hurricane.Several communities in the county suffered extensive damage, especially along the coast.Throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, 65 homes, including 44 mobile homes, were demolished, while 1,008 homes received major damage.Property damages in unincorporated areas alone reach about $320 million.Lee County was lashed by strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused prolonged flooding in some areas.More than 24,000 homes suffered some degree of damage, with almost 3,000 homes receiving major damage and 89 homes being destroyed.Damage in the county totaled about $857 million.\n\nImpact in much of the Miami metropolitan area was generally limited to extensive tree and fence damage, as well as widespread power outages.However, in Miami-Dade County, about 1,000 homes received major damage and about 50% of crops were lost.Storm surge caused coastal flooding from Homestead to Downtown Miami, as well as in portions of Miami Beach.Parts of the Florida Heartland were devastated by high winds and flooding, particularly Hendry and Highlands counties.In the former, which has most citrus trees of any county in Florida, about 60% of orange crops were lost.Throughout Hendry County, a total of 451 homes had minor damage, 131 homes suffered major damage, and 42 others were destroyed.In Highlands County, 13,138 businesses and homes were damaged to some degree, with 144 being destroyed, 963 sustaining major damage, and 2,408 receiving minor damage.In Orange County, wind gusts reached 79 mph at Orlando International Airport.A wind gust of 91 mph was also recorded in Orlando at the top of the Disney Contemporary Resort.Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central Florida left some wind damage and flooding, necessitating evacuations and rescues, including more than 200 people in Orlo Vista after hundreds of homes were flooded.A total of 2,999 business or homes were damaged in Lake County, 7,430 in Seminole County, and 3,457 in Volusia County.Additionally, eight tornadoes touched down in Brevard County, all of which caused damage.\n\nAlong much of the Gulf Coast of Florida, to the north of where Irma made landfall, negative storm surges were observed, with water retracting rather than pushing inland, causing little coastal flooding.However, on the opposite coast, extensive erosion and storm surge flooding occurred in the First Coast, especially in Duval and St. Johns counties.In Duval County, the St. Johns River crested at heights that exceeded records set during Hurricane Dora in 1964.Portions of Jacksonville experienced flooding, particularly the downtown area and the Riverside and San Marco neighborhoods, with about 350 people rescued in those sections of the city.Water reached about high in some homes.The city of Jacksonville suffered about $85 million in damage.\n\nIn St. Johns County, storm surge left extensive damage to oceanfront properties in Ponte Vedra Beach and Vilano Beach, with several becoming uninhabitable.Additionally, some riverfront businesses in St. Augustine\'s historic district were flooded due to storm surge from the Matanzas River.In nearby Clay County, rainfall and storm surge combined to cause extensive flooding along portions of the Black Creek and the St. Johns River, with record high crests at several locations along the former.About 350 people and 75 animals were rescued from floodwaters throughout the county.A total of 275 homes were destroyed, 175 were inflicted major damage, and 124 received minor damage.\n\nThree deaths were reported in Georgia due to falling trees and debris, along with widespread wind damage and power outages throughout the state primarily due to fallen trees.On Tybee Island, as well as St. Simons Island the storm surge caused extensive flooding.The tropical storm also did $54 million in damage in the state.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the third highest storm surge on record was recorded, reaching a height of approximately .By of September 12, almost 100,000 had lost power in Upstate South Carolina.Five people died in storm-related incidents across South Carolina, all from indirect incidents.The tropical storm caused damages totaling $500,000 in the state.\n\nLight damage occurred in other areas, including Tennessee.About 75,000 customers in North Carolina lost power due to Irma.It also caused $600,000 in damages in Alabama.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Irma\'s path through the West Indies and Caribbean, the devastation to roads, harbors and airports significantly impeded the transportation and distribution of relief supplies.Foreign countries moved to provide much of the initial aid.The British, Dutch, French, and United States governments sent warships and planes with supplies and manpower to the region.International leaders, including Dutch King Willem-Alexander and French President Emmanuel Macron, quickly moved to visit affected territories.\n\nSome of the affected countries and territories also offered assistance to each other.Cuba, which sustained extensive damage from the storm, sent 750 health workers to Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, Dominica, and Haiti.Government officials and members of the public in Puerto Rico delivered assistance and evacuated people stranded on other islands.The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services granted special 30-day humanitarian visas for British Virgin Islanders to stay in Puerto Rico.Hundreds of people stranded on Saint Martin were flown to the Dominican Republic on humanitarian grounds.\n\nIn response to Hurricane Jose\'s approach, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a mandatory evacuation on September 9 for any remaining residents on Barbuda.A Miami cargo plane landed on Antigua later that day, carrying over 60 tons (120,000 lbs) of relief supplies for the displaced storm victims—including bottled water, canned food and power generators.\n\nRFA Mounts Bay stationed itself near Anguilla and provided support and relief work to the island with its helicopters and 40 marines and army engineers.The ship delivered 6 tonnes of emergency aid to Anguilla and army engineers repaired a fuel leak at Anguilla\'s main petrol dump, restored power to the island\'s hospital and provided shelters for those left homeless by the hurricane.The ship arrived in the British Virgin Islands on September 8, 2017, to provide emergency relief to the islands, including providing shelters, food and water.HMS Ocean was diverted from the Mediterranean to provide relief from Gibraltar to the affected British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos on September 7, and aid was also supplied by the Department for International Development from their disaster response centre at Kemble Airfield.As part of a £32 million operation named Operation Ruman, nearly 500 UK military personnel with emergency relief were dispatched from RAF Brize Norton.This included the first deployment of No. 38 Expeditionary Air Wing with 3 RAF aircraft; 2 Airbus A400M Atlas and 1 C130J hercules to support relief efforts.\n\nThe British government also drafted 2 members of the UK police calibre into the region on September 10, and 53 police officers were drafted from RAF Brize Norton to the affected British Overseas Territories on September 15 to help maintain order.UK politicians, including the chairs of the foreign affairs and development select committees, criticized both the government\'s preparations for the storm and its response as inadequate.\n\nBy September 12, the Department for International Development had delivered more than 40 tonnes of aid into the region, including into Turks and Caicos, and 1,000 UK military troops were deployed in the region as part of relief efforts.The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, pledged an additional £25 million worth of funding as part of relief efforts in the region on September 13, 2017, and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Boris Johnson, said that a further 250 UK military personnel would be deployed into the area within the next few days.Anguilla\'s Chief Minister, Victor Banks, praised the British government\'s response to the storm and said that Boris Johnson\'s visit to the island ""sends a very positive signal to Anguillans that the British are serious about their response to this very severe hurricane"", but went on to say that the current financial commitment from the UK was not substantial enough.\n\nBy September 15, the United Kingdom had over 70 military personnel and 4 police officers in Anguilla and had delivered 15 tonnes of aid to the island.In the British Virgin Islands, Royal Marines had cleared the airfield so that it was operational for the delivery of aid into the islands, with more than 200 British military personnel and 54 UK police officers on the ground and 8 tonnes of aid delivered to the islands.120 British military personnel were on the ground in Turks and Caicos, and over 150 shelter kits and 720 liters of water were delivered to the islands on September 15.\n\nAmendments to international aid rules by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (or OECD) allowed for the UK government to provide access to £13 billion worth of aid to the affected British Overseas Territories, through the UK\'s Official Development Assistance (ODA) by November 2017.\n\nBy the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage.The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by Irma\'s eye, remained largely inaccessible for days.Assessments showed that 15% of the national telecommunications network had been affected, with at least one tower destroyed.Bahamasair resumed a limited domestic schedule on September 10, with international flights still cancelled due to existing and anticipated destruction at other destinations.\n\nThe worst devastation occurred on Ragged Island, over which Irma\'s eye had directly passed.After days of the National Emergency Management Agency not being able to physically reach the island, officials were finally able to inspect it; they promptly declared it uninhabitable.Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said that it was the worst disaster area he or his officials had ever seen, and that all remaining residents would need to leave, potentially permanently.Business leaders and other officials called for a new long-term development model to shift the population away from such sparsely-settled islands.\n\nOn Grand Bahama and Bimini, where tornadoes associated with Irma touched down on September 10, more than 100 people were left displaced.Infrastructure damage included docks, parks, and the power system.\n\nAside from tangible asset losses, Irma brought significant economic damages.International freight shipping was projected to be offline for a week, and costs for rebuilding supplies were inflated due to demand in the U.S.\n\nSwollen rivers contributed to worsening flooding in the days after the storm system left, resulting in additional evacuations.Officials resorted to using inflatable rafts to access affected areas.The national electrical infrastructure was said to be extensively damaged.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, flooding worsened following Irma\'s departure, leading the number of displaced persons to increase to more than 24,000 by September 8.President Danilo Medina ordered further evacuations due to at-risk dams, while the government banned swimming in rivers and ordered boats kept in port.More than 422,000 people were left without water due to 28 aqueducts being damaged.\n\nIn Haiti, officials stated that losses were greater than they could have been since people largely did not heed early preparation and evacuation warnings.At least 5,000 homes were flooded.One man died trying to cross a flooded river; another went missing and 17 were injured.The trash- and waste-contaminated floodwaters in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives led to fears of cholera outbreaks.Flooding continued to worsen days after the storm, as runoff from the mountains swelled rivers in low-lying farming communities.United Nations peacekeepers from Brazil were able to gain access to the flooded northwest region to provide urgent aid, but non-governmental organizations and Haitian economists warned that the estimated 30,000 victims would need longer-term assistance as well.Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant appointed a government commission to address Irma\'s effects, with Action Against Hunger in charge of humanitarian coordination.\n\nIn the USVI, residents and tourists alike were described as being in a state of traumatic shock.By September 7, the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship had arrived in the USVI to provide supplies, damage assessment, and evacuation assistance.Four additional warships, some of which had already been on their way to Texas to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief, were redirected to the region.At a September 10 news conference, Governor Kenneth Mapp described Irma as a ""horrific disaster"" for which ""[t]here will be no restorations or solutions in days or weeks.""The Federal Emergency Management Agency airlifted in goods for residents, who were subjected to a curfew.Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line agreed to transport tourists to Florida, contingent upon port availability following the state\'s own experience with Irma.\n\nOn Saint John, described as ""perhaps the site of Irma\'s worst devastation on American soil,"" it took six days for an active-theater disaster zone to be established, leading to criticism of the U.S. government response.The National Guard was delayed in reaching Saint John due to the number of overturned boats left in the harbor.The National Guard was brought in to maintain order, while the Coast Guard brought evacuees to cruise ships bound for San Juan and Miami.There was still no electricity on St. John in the middle of October 2017.\n\nBy September 9, more than one million Puerto Ricans were still without power, tens of thousands were without water, and several thousand were still in shelters.Hospitals were operating on generator power.The government was struggling to establish contact with the islands of Culebra and Vieques.By September 10, the main island had recovered enough to serve as a refuge for people stranded on other islands, including 1,200 tourists from Saint Martin and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Airlifts had brought more than 50 patients to Puerto Rico.\n\nFive months after Irma, two-thirds of the hospital beds on Saint Thomas were still unavailable, due to extensive physical damage and staffing shortages.\n\nDamage to Sint Maarten\'s harbour and to Princess Juliana International Airport left the Dutch part of Saint Martin unreachable, although the smaller Grand Case-Espérance Airport on the French side could be reopened by September 7 for supply aid by helicopter and airplane.The French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops on board a CASA/IPTN CN-235 aircraft.\n\nThe following day, the Dutch military was able to airlift dialysis patients off the island while also dropping leaflets to warn islanders about the rapidly approaching Hurricane Jose.Although the airport was closed, 435 students and faculty of the American University of the Caribbean were evacuated by the U.S. military.On September 10, Dutch King Willem-Alexander departed for the region, with intentions to visit Sint Maarten and other affected Dutch territories and commonwealth members.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron followed this announcement by stating his intentions to visit the French part of the island on September 12 in order to bring aid supplies.In response to criticism of the French handling of the disaster, 1,000 troops, police, and other emergency workers were sent to Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.\n\nOn both sides of Saint Martin, desperate conditions combined with food and water shortages in Irma\'s aftermath led to reports of violence, scavenging, and theft.In response, the French government increased its troop deployment to 2,200 and the Dutch government sent more than 600 military and police personnel.\n\nThe day after the hurricane hit Saint Barthelemy the French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops into the reopened Grand Case-Espérance Airport.On September 7 and 9, equipment and personnel were flown from France to Guadeloupe and Martinique.\n\nSporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm.\n\nOn September 11, Florida Governor Rick Scott conducted an aerial tour to survey the damage to the Keys.The Overseas Highway remained closed while authorities assessed the integrity of the 42 bridges along the route.Residents returning to the Keys were faced with a police roadblock, to the south of Florida City.USS Iwo Jima, USS New York and aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were sent to the Keys area to aid with the recovery.\n\nOn September 12, some residents were allowed to return into the Keys as far as Islamorada.Although road damage blocked entry any farther than Islamorada, bridges had been inspected and found safe to Sugarloaf Key.By late on September 12, the Overseas Highway had been repaired and the bridges inspected as safe for first responders to travel to Key West.On September 16, residents were free to return to Marathon.Residents were allowed to return to Key West the following day, although the Keys remained closed to tourists and a checkpoint remained in place in Florida City.\n\nDue mainly to the widespread loss of power, cell phone service was also reduced after battery backup power for cell phone towers ran out and backup generators ran out of fuel.In an impact report by the FCC, as of 11 AM EDT on September 12, 89 of 108 (82%) cell phone towers were non-functioning in Monroe County (Florida Keys), 154 of 212 (73%) were non-functioning in Collier County (Naples), 36 of 46 (78%) were non-functioning in Hendry County, and an additional six counties had 41-60% of cell phone towers not functioning, including Lee County (Fort Myers) and Miami-Dade County.\n\nNOAA released map-format aerial reconnaissance image data of damage from the storm.The imagery featured several areas of Florida: including the Florida Keys, the southwest coast of Florida from Marco Island to Punta Gorda, much of the northeast coast of Florida, and portions of the Jacksonville area.Portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts were also photographed.Additionally, the Sun-Sentinel published before and after photos of several landmarks in the Florida Keys.\n\nIn the days after the hurricane, due to the heavy rainfall, numerous rivers had flooded, including residential areas.Public health risks, such as diarrheal infections and mosquito-borne illnesses, remain from the flooding that resulted in the aftermath of the hurricane.A large concern from flooding is contamination because people become exposed to dirty floodwaters and the potential for contaminated water to enter the local water supply is significant.One example of an illness that can enter the water supply is leptospirosis, which is rat urine carries into the floodwaters.Untreated exposure to leptospirosis can cause kidney damage, meningitis, and liver failure.Noroviruses and other infections are also a risk.\n\nFollowing Irma\'s passage, a hand-carved wooden canoe was discovered on the banks of the Indian River and could be several hundred years old.The state has removed the canoe for examination and safe keeping.\n\nDue to Irma\'s and Hurricane Harvey\'s impact in Florida and Texas, U.S. employment declined in September 2017 for the first time since September 2010.The leisure and hospitality industries were especially hard hit, losing 111,000 jobs in September.\n\nIrma set multiple records for intensity, especially at easterly longitudes, time spent at such an intensity, and its intensity at landfall.When Irma reached Category 5 intensity with winds of at 11:45 UTC on September 5 at 57.7°W, it became the easternmost Atlantic hurricane of this strength on record, surpassing Hurricane David of 1979, later beaten by Hurricane Lorenzo 2 years later.By 00:15 UTC on September 6, Irma reached peak intensity with () winds and a minimum pressure of .This ties it with Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and Hurricane Rita of 2005 as the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed.Only five other Atlantic hurricanes have been recorded with wind speeds higher than Irma: Hurricane Allen of 1980, which had maximum sustained winds of , and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Gilbert of 1988, Hurricane Wilma of 2005, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, all of which had peak winds of .At the time, Irma was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; later surpassed by Hurricane Dorian, and was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007.In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category 5 strength winds, and the third-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, with a value of 64.9 units.Only the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane and Hurricane Ivan in 2004 achieved higher values.\n\nOn September 6, Irma made landfall on the islands of Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Virgin Gorda at peak strength.This ties Irma with cyclones Monica of 2006 and Winston of 2016, and typhoons Zeb of 1998 and Megi of 2010 as the seventh-strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall globally – in terms of sustained winds – trailing only Typhoon Goni of 2020 which bore winds of at landfall, Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 and Typhoon Meranti of 2016, which bore winds of at landfall, and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Typhoon Joan of 1959, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, which bore winds of at landfall.Irma is second to the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin, and is the first hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic at Category 5 status since Felix in 2007.Irma is the first recorded Category 5 hurricane to affect the northern Leeward Islands, and was one of the worst storms to hit the region on record, along with Hurricane Donna in 1960 and Hurricane Luis in 1995.In addition, Irma is only the second hurricane on record to make landfall in Cuba at Category 5 intensity, with the other being a hurricane in 1924.Furthermore, when Irma made landfall on Barbuda, Saint Martin, Virgin Gorda, and Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane, it became one of only two recorded Atlantic storms to make landfall in multiple nations at this strength; the other was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which struck both Eleuthera and the United States as a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nIrma made landfall in the Florida Keys with winds of and a pressure of , making it the strongest hurricane to strike Florida in terms of wind speed since Charley in 2004, and the most intense to strike the state in terms of barometric pressure since Andrew in 1992.In the span of two weeks, two Category 4 hurricanes—Harvey and Irma—struck the continental United States, the first time on record two Atlantic tropical cyclones of such strength made landfall on the country in the same hurricane season.This also marked only the third occurrence of two consecutive Atlantic storms making landfall in the United States as major hurricanes.The other two instances were the Great Charleston and Cheniere Caminada hurricanes in 1893, and hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne in 2004.\n\nBecause of the extensive damage and loss of life the hurricane caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Irma from its rotating naming lists in April 2018, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane.It was replaced with Idalia for the 2023 season.\n\nWeather of 2017 Tropical cyclones in 2017 List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes Operation RUMAN – UK military-civil disaster relief response to Hurricane Irma.List of Cuba hurricanes List

39,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Hurricane Irma', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'Hurricane Irma was an extremely powerful Cape Verde hurricane that caused widespread destruction across its path in early September 2017.Irma was the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the Leeward Islands on record, followed by Maria two weeks later.At the time, it was considered the most powerful hurricane on record in the open Atlantic region, outside of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, until it was surpassed by Hurricane Dorian two years later.It was also the third-strongest Atlantic hurricane at landfall ever recorded, just behind the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane and Dorian.The ninth named storm, fourth hurricane, second major hurricane, and first Category 5 hurricane of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Irma caused widespread and catastrophic damage throughout its long lifetime, particularly in the northeastern Caribbean and the Florida Keys.It was also the most intense hurricane to strike the continental United States since Katrina in 2005, the first major hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Wilma in the same year, and the first Category 4 hurricane to strike the state since Charley in 2004.The word Irmageddon was coined soon after the hurricane to describe the damage caused by the hurricane.\n\nIrma developed from a tropical wave near the Cape Verde Islands on August 30.Favorable conditions allowed Irma to rapidly intensify into a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson wind scale by late on August 31.The storm\'s intensity fluctuated between Categories 2 and 3 for the next several days, due to a series of eyewall replacement cycles.On September 4, Irma resumed intensifying, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by early on the next day.Early on September 6, Irma peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of and a minimum pressure of .Irma was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017 in terms of barometric pressure, and the strongest worldwide in 2017 in terms of wind speed.Another eyewall replacement cycle caused Irma to weaken back to a Category 4 hurricane, but the storm re-attained Category 5 status before making landfall in Cuba.Although Irma briefly weakened to a Category 2 storm while making landfall on Cuba, the system re-intensified to Category 4 status as it crossed the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, before making landfall on Cudjoe Key on September 10.Irma then weakened to Category 3 status, prior to another landfall in Florida on Marco Island later that day.The system degraded into a remnant low over Alabama and ultimately dissipated on September 13 over Missouri.\n\nThe storm caused catastrophic damage in Barbuda, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Anguilla, and the Virgin Islands as a Category 5 hurricane.The hurricane caused at least 134 deaths: one in Anguilla; one in Barbados; three in Barbuda; four in the British Virgin Islands; 10 in Cuba; 11 in the French West Indies; one in Haiti; three in Puerto Rico; four on the Dutch side of Sint Maarten; 92 in the contiguous United States, and four in the U.S. Virgin Islands.Hurricane Irma was the top Google searched term in the U.S. and globally in 2017.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa on August 26.The tropical wave moved off the coast of the continent late on August 27.Throughout the next two days, showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low-pressure area, as the system passed just south of and then through the Cape Verde Islands on August 29.Around 00:00 UTC on the following day, the system developed into a tropical depression just west of the Cape Verde Islands.Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Irma, based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates.With warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, strengthening was anticipated, with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier air.\n\nThe nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow, as an anticyclone became established over the system, with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images.Early on August 31, shortly after the development of a central dense overcast (CDO) and an eye feature, Irma underwent rapid intensification, becoming a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 UTC and then a Category 3 hurricane, becoming a major hurricane – around 00:00 UTC on September 1.Within a 48-hour period, the hurricane\'s intensity had increased by .On September 2, a ship passed to the west of the center of Irma, recording maximum winds of , which indicated that the eye of Irma remained compact.A strong high pressure system to the north of Irma caused the storm to move west-southwestward between September 2 and September 4.The first aircraft reconnaissance mission departed from Barbados on the afternoon of September 3, discovering an eye in diameter and surface winds of .\n\nOn September 4, after moving into more favorable conditions, Irma strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane.As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by 12:00 UTC on the following day, with winds of .The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at near 18:00 UTC on September 5. Irma acquired annular characteristics around this time, with the storm exhibiting a large, symmetric CDO and an impressive satellite appearance.Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern Leeward Islands.Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of Barbuda at peak intensity, with the storm\'s central minimum pressure having bottomed out at – this was the lowest in the Atlantic since Dean in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of .Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15 UTC on Sint Maarten, and at 16:30 UTC on Virgin Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands, though the storm\'s central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall.\n\nAs the hurricane moved away from the Virgin Islands late on September 6, observations from reconnaissance flights, as well as Doppler radar in San Juan, Puerto Rico, indicated an elliptical eye and double eyewalls.Late on September 6, the cyclone passed about north of Puerto Rico.Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of Hispaniola throughout the day on September 7.After beginning an eyewall replacement cycle, Irma weakened to a Category 4 hurricane as it passed south of the Turks and Caicos Islands early on September 8.This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category 5 intensity, the second-longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above – behind only the 1932 Cuba hurricane.At 05:00 UTC on September 8, Irma made landfall on the island of Little Inagua in the Bahamas with sustained winds of .The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a subtropical ridge to its north.Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category 5 intensity at 18:00 UTC that day east of Cuba as deep convection became more pronounced and organized.The hurricane then made landfall in Cayo Romano, Cuba, at 03:00 UTC on September 9, with winds of .This made Irma only the second Category 5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the 1924 Cuba hurricane.As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category 2 storm later on September 9.\n\nAfter slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards Florida around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental United States.Moving over the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, Irma quickly restrengthened to a Category 4 hurricane at 06:00 UTC on September 10, as deep convection improved and the eye became better defined.In addition, Irma\'s wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of and gale-force winds spanning in diameter.The cyclone made landfall in Cudjoe Key, Florida, at 13:00 UTC on September 10, at Category 4 intensity, with winds of .Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category 3 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30 UTC, in Marco Island, Florida, with sustained winds of .Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category 3 intensity hours after landfall.Passing east of Tampa as a weakening Category 1 hurricane around 06:00 UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation – though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds.The system finally weakened to a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC that day as it entered southern Georgia, while acquiring some extratropical characteristics.At 06:00 UTC on September 12, Irma degenerated to a remnant low just as it entered Alabama, as most of the deep convection had diminished.The remnants persisted for another day or so before dissipating over Missouri on September 13.\n\nGiven that Irma\'s forecast track was along much of the Caribbean island chain, hurricane warnings were issued for the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and parts of Hispaniola on September 5.\n\nIn Antigua and Barbuda, residents safeguarded their homes and cleaned up their properties in anticipation of strong winds.Emergency crews were put on standby at public shelters and hospitals by September 5 to assist with any evacuations.Expecting a direct hit, more than half of the residents on Barbuda took shelter, and relief supplies were preemptively mobilized.The National Emergency Management Organization on Saint Lucia urged small craft operators and swimmers to be mindful of forecasts for high surf.Small Craft Warnings and High Surf Advisories were hoisted for Dominica, where residents were urged to remain vigilant of the potential for high waves, landslides, and flooding.\n\nIn Guadeloupe, low-lying and cliff-edge homes were evacuated at the threat of flooding and erosion.Schools and public businesses closed on September 5 and 6.Hospitals stocked up on three days\' worth of supplies and checked the functionality of their generators.Of the island\'s 32 communes, 22 activated their emergency plans; 1,500 people were urged to take shelter.The island sustained relatively minor damage and became the base for relief efforts on Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.Though the core of the hurricane was expected to remain north of the island, a yellow alert was issued for Martinique due to the likelihood of rough seas.The island dispatched relief supplies and military reinforcements to its neighboring islands of Guadeloupe, Saint Martin.and Saint Barthélemy, which faced a greater risk of a direct impact.\n\nOn September 4, Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency.By September 6, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency had deployed response teams in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.Supplies, including food rations, medical supplies, and blankets, were pre-staged in strategic locations on the islands for distribution.\n\nOn September 5, the Dominican Republic activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage; the United States and Haiti followed suit two days later.According to officials, 11,200 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas prior to the storm\'s arrival.Approximately 7,400 tourists were moved to Santo Domingo, away from beach resorts.In Haiti, government officials and aid organizations struggled with early preparation and evacuation efforts.While some officials blamed reluctance and indifference on the part of the population, others ""admitted they were not prepared for the onslaught and no mandatory evacuation orders were in place ahead of Irma\'s approach.""Local officials contended that they had not received promised funds, supplies, or equipment from the national government.The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti prepared its 1,000 peacekeepers and engineers to assist.\n\nIn the Turks and Caicos, evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas starting September 5. Schools were closed, government buildings were boarded up, and shelters were opened.Officials spread warnings to residents in English, Creole, and Spanish via social media, radio, SMS text, and WhatsApp.In The Bahamas, the government began preparations the week prior to the hurricane\'s arrival, including securing national sports facilities to use as shelters.By September 7, the government had evacuated 1,609 people by air from the southern islands, including 365 from Bimini.Controlled cutting of the power supply to southern and central Bahamian islands was conducted in advance of the storm.Shelters were made available, though usage was low due to most evacuees staying with family on other islands.Of the 2,679 foreign tourists still in The Bahamas on September 7, about 1,200 were being housed at Atlantis Paradise Island, one of the most hurricane-ready structures in the country.\n\nIn Cuba, meteorologists did not initially predict a direct hit.Fuel conservation was enacted in Camagüey Province to ensure that enough would be available during post-storm power outages.The Civil Defense evacuated nearly one million people from low-lying areas, including thousands of Canadian and European tourists in the Jardines del Rey.Dolphins at a Cayo Guillermo resort were evacuated by helicopter.\n\nThe NHC issued several watches and warnings for the Southeastern United States.The first watches and warnings were issued at 15:00 UTC on September 7, which was a hurricane watch from the Jupiter Inlet to Bonita Beach, including the Florida Keys and Lake Okeechobee.The watches and warnings were extended into Georgia and South Carolina on September 9.At 21:00 UTC on that day, the advisories reached their maximum extent, with a hurricane warning covering the entire east coast of the state, the west coast from Indian Pass southward, and the Florida Keys; a hurricane watch was in place from the Florida–Georgia state line to Edisto Beach, South Carolina; and there were two tropical storm warnings, one in Florida from Indian Pass to the Okaloosa–Walton county line and the other from the Florida–Georgia state line to the South Santee River in South Carolina.Watches and warnings were gradually discontinued as Irma moved inland and weakened, with all of them canceled by early on September 12.\n\nOn September 4, Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency.Governor Scott placed 100 members of the Florida National Guard on duty to assist in preparations.All 7,000 troops were ordered to be on duty by September 8.Officials advised residents to stock their hurricane kits.The state coordinated with electrical companies in order for power outages to be restored as quickly as possible, extending resources such as equipment, fuel, and lodging for the approximately 24,000 restoration personnel who had been activated.Governor Scott suspended tolls on all toll roads in Florida, including the turnpike.All state offices in Florida were closed from September 8 to September 11, while public schools, state colleges, and state universities in all 67 counties were closed during the same period.The Florida Department of Education coordinated with school districts as the need for transportation by school buses and opening shelters arose.By September 9, more than 150 state parks were closed.Throughout the state, almost 700 emergency shelters were opened.The shelters collectively housed about 191,764 people, with more than 40% of them staying in a shelter in South Florida.Additionally, more than 60 special needs shelters were opened, which housed more than 5,000 people by September 9.\n\nMany airports across the state, particularly in Central and South Florida, were closed.Nearly 9,000 flights intending to arrive in or depart from Florida were canceled.Along Florida\'s coasts, most seaports were closed or opened with restricted access.For the fifth time in its 45-year history, the Walt Disney World Resort was completely closed due to the storm.Its theme parks, water parks, and Disney Springs were all closed by 9:00 p.m. on September 9 and remained closed until September 12.Other Orlando-area theme parks, including Universal Orlando Resort and SeaWorld Orlando, were also closed.The Kennedy Space Center was closed from September 8 to September 15.\n\nAn estimated 6.5 million Floridians were ordered to evacuate, mostly those living on barrier islands or in coastal areas; in mobile or sub-standard homes; and in low-lying or flood prone areas.Mandatory evacuations were ordered for portions of Brevard, Broward, Citrus, Collier, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Glades, Hendry, Hernando, Indian River, Lee, Martin, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Lucie, Sumter, and Volusia counties.All of Monroe County, where the Florida Keys are located, was placed under a mandatory evacuation.Residents in communities near the southern half of Lake Okeechobee were also ordered to leave.Additionally, voluntary evacuation notices were issued for all or parts of Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Charlotte, Columbia, Desoto, Hardee, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lake, Manatee, Okeechobee, Osceola, and Polk counties.\n\nA record 6.5 million Floridians evacuated, making it the largest evacuation in the state\'s history.Evacuees caused significant traffic congestion on northbound Interstate 95, Interstate 75, and Florida\'s Turnpike, exacerbated by the fact that the entire Florida peninsula was within the cone of uncertainty in the NHC\'s forecast path in the days before the storm, so evacuees from both coasts headed north, as evacuees would not be safer by fleeing to the opposite coast.Fuel was in short supply throughout peninsular Florida during the week before Irma\'s arrival, especially along evacuation routes, leading to hours-long lines at fuel stations and even escorts of fuel trucks by the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nUse of the left shoulder as a lane for moving traffic was allowed on northbound Interstate 75 from Wildwood to the Georgia state line beginning September 8 and on eastbound Interstate 4 from Tampa to State Road 429 near Celebration for a few hours on September 9.It was the first time that the shoulder-use plan, which was introduced at the start of the 2017 hurricane season, was implemented by the state for hurricane evacuations.The shoulder-use plan was implemented in place of labor- and resource-intensive contraflow lane reversal, in which both sides of an interstate highway are used for one direction of traffic.\n\nOfficials from the Environmental Protection Agency, which had been criticized for its response to Hurricane Harvey, took special measures to inspect and secure hazardous materials, especially at Superfund sites.Direct Relief, a disaster relief organization, coordinated with local health centers and provided resources to help facilities on the front lines of Floridian and Puerto Rican communities.\n\nGeorgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency initially for all six coastal counties on September 6, but eventually expanded the declaration to 94 counties south of Atlanta metropolitan area, and then the entire state on September 10.Atlanta was placed under its first-ever tropical storm warning.Governor Deal ordered mandatory evacuations for all areas east of Interstate 95 on September 7, before extending the order to the entirety of Chatham County and low-lying areas west of I-95 on the following day.In total, 540,000 people on the Georgia coast were ordered to leave.Contraflow lane reversal for Interstate 16 took effect on the morning of September 9 from Savannah to Dublin, Georgia.All Georgia state parks were open for free to evacuees, as was the 800-acre camping area at Atlanta Motor Speedway.Reversible HOT lanes on Interstate 75 in Georgia through south metro Atlanta were open 24 hours northbound with no tolls.\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on September 6, with South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster following suit the same day.Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency on September 8 in order to protect Virginia residents and to mobilize resources in support of neighboring states.Officials in New Orleans stated that there would not be much time for preparations if Irma failed to make the projected northward turn, but that South Texas or Florida would not be a good evacuation destination.On September 10, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam issued an executive order allowing medical professionals in other states to practice in Tennessee to aid Hurricane Irma evacuees.This order also allowed pharmacies to give out 14-day supplies of medicine, and gave women and children from outside the state the ability to participate in the Tennessee Department of Health programs.Bristol Motor Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway, and Charlotte Motor Speedway all opened their campgrounds to evacuees free of charge.\n\nIn professional sports, the Miami Dolphins–Tampa Bay Buccaneers game scheduled for September 10 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was postponed to November 19 due to the storm\'s threat.The Dolphins left early for their road game against the Los Angeles Chargers.The Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees moved their September 11–13 series from Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg to Citi Field in Queens.Minor League Baseball\'s Florida State League, Carolina League, and Southern League called off their championship finals and as a result, named their division series winners league co-champions.The Miami FC versus San Francisco Deltas match on September 10 was cancelled so the players and staff could prepare for the storm with their families.The Orlando Pride of the National Women\'s Soccer League rescheduled their September 9 match to September 7. Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer did not have any scheduled home games in September, but was unable to return to training facilities in Orlando due to Hurricane Irma.\n\nIn college football, the UCF Knights-Memphis Tigers game scheduled for September 9 was moved to September 30, replacing UCF\'s game against Maine and Memphis game against Georgia State.UCF also cancelled their game against Georgia Tech on September 16, as UCF\'s stadium hosted the National Guard.The USF Bulls-Connecticut Huskies football game was also cancelled.The Miami Hurricanes–Arkansas State Redwolves game scheduled for September 9 at Centennial Bank Stadium in Arkansas was canceled due to travel concerns for the University of Miami.The Florida Gators-Northern Colorado Bears match in Gainesville scheduled for September 9 was cancelled.The Florida State Seminoles contest against the Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks was canceled on September 8.The Seminoles\' rivalry game with the Hurricanes in Tallahassee, originally scheduled for September 16, was postponed tp October 7.The FIU Panthers game against the Alcorn State Braves was moved up a day and relocated to Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.The Georgia Southern Eagles game against the New Hampshire Wildcats on September 9 was also moved to Legion Field for that day.\n\nAs of September 5, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding was running dangerously low, due to its response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas the previous week, prompting the Trump administration to request an immediate $8 billion in additional funding as Irma approached Florida.Given the rate that current funds are being consumed and the catastrophic damage, the United States Senate almost doubled the requested amount to $15.3 billion, with the understanding that this would only be about 10% of what will be required for responding to Harvey.\n\nHurricane Irma\'s path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating, with landfalls in Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Martin, the Bahamas, Cuba, and the United States, all at major hurricane intensity.Furthermore, the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences.Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria.\n\nThe eyewall of the hurricane moved over Barbuda near its record peak intensity early on September 6; a weather station observed a wind gust of .The same station also recorded a minimum barometric pressure of .The exact state of the island remained unclear for hours after Irma\'s passage, as downed phone lines ceased all communication with nearby islands.Later that afternoon, Prime Minister Gaston Browne surveyed the territory by helicopter, revealing an effectively uninhabitable island.Irma damaged or destroyed 95% of the structures on Barbuda, including its hospital, schools, and both of its hotels; it completely flattened some residential blocks while submerging others.The destruction rendered the island\'s sole airport and much of its infrastructure inoperative—including water and telecommunication services—which further hampered relief efforts.Property damage on Barbuda ranged from $150 million to $300 million.A total of three storm-related deaths were reported on the island.\n\nIn addition to the catastrophic impact on Barbuda\'s human residents, concern turned to the storm\'s effects on the island\'s wildlife.The island\'s only endemic bird, the near-threatened Barbuda warbler, numbered less than 2,000 individuals prior to the hurricane.For some time it was unknown if the warbler survived the hurricane or its aftermath; however within a few months it was confirmed that not only did the species survive, but the most of the birds survived the storm.Barbuda\'s Codrington Lagoon, home to the largest colony of magnificent frigatebirds in the Caribbean, with an estimated 2,500 nesting pairs, was also inundated by the storm surge.\n\nRemaining just outside of Irma\'s strongest windfield, Antigua sustained less severe damage, in the form of leveled roofs and fences, downed power poles and lines, and uprooted trees.Some street flooding also took place in low-lying areas.Three people were treated for minor storm-related injuries.Forensic disaster analysts from the Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM), a Germany-based risk management agency, estimate that economic losses for Antigua and Barbuda will exceed $120 million.\n\nOn the morning of September 6, Irma\'s center crossed the island of Saint Martin while the storm was at peak intensity, sweeping away entire structures, submerging roads and cars, and triggering an island-wide blackout.Irma\'s extreme winds ripped trees out of the ground and sent vehicles and debris from damaged structures scattered across the territory.On the French side of Saint-Martin, entire marinas around Marigot were left in ruins, littered with the stranded remnants of boats that had smashed into each other.A hotel caught on fire, but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze.Another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor.Media images depicted devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds had shattered their windows.Irma killed four people on the French side of the island and injured 50 others, one of whom was in critical condition.As many as 95% of the buildings there were damaged to some degree; 60% of those were totally uninhabitable.Estimates from CEDIM indicate a minimum of $950 million worth of economic losses.Total losses exceeded €3.5 billion (US$4.17 billion).\n\nA similar situation unfolded in Sint Maarten, Saint Martin\'s Dutch half, as intense winds ripped through buildings and lifted vehicles aloft ""as if they were matches"".The hurricane wreaked havoc on Princess Juliana International Airport, with ""huge chunks of the building [strewn] across the runway and a jet bridge snapped in half.""It demolished or severely damaged about 70% of Sint Maarten\'s houses, forcing thousands of residents into public shelters.There were 4 deaths and 23 injuries, 11 of which were serious, in the Dutch territory.Irma is considered the worst natural disaster to hit Sint Maarten; the extent of its damage far exceeded that of any previous hurricane.Total damages were estimated at €2.5 billion (US$2.98 billion).\n\nIrma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the French island of Saint Barthélemy, southeast of Saint Martin.Describing the extent of the destruction, one local compared it to ""a bomb that burned all vegetation,"" while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively ""erased the island from the map"".Violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments, with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation.Streets in the capital of Gustavia were turned into rushing rivers, which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture.The island\'s fire station was inundated with up to of flood waters.With scores of homes and much of the infrastructure destroyed, the majority of the island\'s population was left stranded and without water, electricity or phone service.The associated economic losses could exceed $480 million according to CEDIM\'s analysts.\n\nPreliminary assessments from the French government indicate that Hurricane Irma caused a combined €1.2 billion (US$1.43 billion) in insured losses across the French territories of Saint-Martin and Saint Barts.This total covered private property such as homes, vehicles and businesses (including lost revenue); the extent of the damage to infrastructural and public facilities remains undetermined.Nonetheless, this made Irma one of the costliest natural disasters to hit the French Republic in 50 years.\n\nOn January 30, 2018, roughly five months after Irma, an analysis was published indicating that an anemometer on the island recorded an unofficial gust to before failing.\n\nThe British Overseas Territory of Anguilla saw the eyewall of the storm pass over it on September 6.Many homes and schools were destroyed, and the island\'s only hospital was badly damaged.The devastation was particularly severe in East End, where the winds uprooted scores of trees and power poles and demolished a number of houses.In The Valley, the island\'s capital, the hurricane blew out the windows of government buildings.Rough seas inflicted heavy damage upon several bays and harbors, and a seaside restaurant was completely eradicated.About 90% of roads were left impassable.The island\'s air traffic control tower was damaged, exacerbating the already poor communication with the island.One death was reported on the island.Estimates of losses on the island total at least $190 million.\n\nLarge swells ahead of Irma washed ashore debris and sea life in Castries, Saint Lucia, blocking some roads.Seaside roads were inundated with water.One surfer was killed amid rough surf in Barbados after hitting a reef and breaking his neck.Trees were also destroyed.The hurricane\'s effects, such as violent seas and rattling trees, were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in Guadeloupe.Several houses were damaged.Around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm, leaving several communes in the dark without running water.Overall damage was limited to external parts of houses and trees that were blown onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seas.\n\nSaint Kitts and Nevis endured similar conditions to other islands.Blustery rainstorms triggered scattered power outages and disabled the island\'s water system, but per the International Red Cross, the islands were spared the level of destruction seen elsewhere.Still, Prime Minister Timothy Harris stated that property and infrastructure had sustained ""significant damage.""The Dutch territories of Saba and Sint Eustatius were also struck by the hurricane\'s winds, resulting in infrastructural damage, water shortages and telecommunication outages.Several houses were left uninhabitable.On Saba, the hurricane also defoliated trees and injured a few people.CEDIM\'s analysts expect economic losses of $20–65 million for the two islands.\n\nDamage in the British Virgin Islands was extensive.Numerous buildings and roads were destroyed on the island of Tortola, which bore the brunt of the hurricane\'s core.Four people were confirmed dead.Along Cane Garden Bay, the storm surge submerged several seaside bars and a gas station.Satellite images revealed many of the island\'s residential zones had been left in ruins.The hurricane passed over Necker Island, also causing severe damage and destroying the mansion of Richard Branson.\n\nMost homes and businesses were destroyed on the island of Jost Van Dyke, the smallest of the B.V.I.\'s four main islands.The Governor, Gus Jaspert, who had only been sworn into office 13 days previously, declared a state of emergency - the first time this has ever happened in the Territory.After the storm, restoration of electricity took approximately 5 months.\n\nIrma\'s effects in the U.S. Virgin Islands were most profound on Saint Thomas, where at least of rain fell, and on Saint John.Saint Thomas island suffered widespread structural damage, including to its police station and airport.Patients from the fourth and third floors of Charlotte Amalie\'s hospital had to be relocated to lower floors due to flooding from roof leaks.Three deaths were attributed to Irma on the island.On nearby Saint Croix, there were communication issues and some damage to the infrastructure.Saint John lost access to ferry and cargo services, along with access to the local airport.Due to its normal reliance on electricity from Saint Thomas, the island was left without power.Total damage from the three islands was at least $1.1 billion.\n\nThe hurricane passed north of Puerto Rico, but still caused significant damage to the United States territory.Along the coast, a tide gauge observed waves up to mean higher high water.Much of the main island experienced sustained tropical storm force winds, with a peak sustained wind speed of at a weather station along San Juan Bay, while the same site observed a peak wind gust of .However, on the island of Culebra, a wind gust of was reported.Mainly due to strong winds, approximately 1.1 million out of 1.5 million of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority\'s customers lost electricity.Portions of Puerto Rico received heavy rainfall, with a peak total of in Bayamón, causing seven rivers to reach flood stage, widespread flash flooding, and at least six landslides.\n\nThe most severely affected areas included the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques, as well as the northeastern, northern, and mountainous portions of the main island.On Culebra, the island suffered an almost complete loss of electrical and water services.At least 30 homes on the island were destroyed, while about 30 other experienced substantial damage.High winds also toppled a number of trees.The only telecommunications tower on Culebra sustained damage, cutting off outside communications for several hours.In rural Loíza, 79 homes were destroyed.Throughout Puerto Rico, 781 out of 1,600 telecommunications towers went out of commission, primarily due to power outages.At least 362,000 customers lost water services.Debris, mostly fallen trees, blocked at least 72 roads.Approximately 25% to 30% of banana, coffee, papaya, and plantain crops were damaged by strong winds, with losses to farmers estimated at $30.6 million.Approximately 1,530 homes experienced at least moderate damage, with 1,448 homes moderately damaged, 32 extensively damaged, and 50 completely destroyed.\n\nHurricane Irma was attributed to around $1 billion in damage, and the NHC attributed three fatalities to Irma in Puerto Rico, though four deaths were related to the storm.Two people died due to rainstorms ahead of the hurricane: one man died in Orocovis after falling off his ladder while repairing his roof; another man on the coast in Capitanejo died after being struck by lightning.Three nearby fishermen were burned by the same lightning strike, but survived.Two other people died during the hurricane: a woman died while being evacuated from her house in a wheelchair and fell, hitting her head; another person died in a car accident in Canóvanas.Governor Ricardo Rosselló declared the islands of Culebra and Vieques to be disaster areas.\n\nAlthough spared a direct hit, both the Dominican Republic and Haiti were affected by high winds and heavy rains.A bridge over the Dajabón River connecting the two countries was broken.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, the fishing community of Nagua sustained damage from waves that destroyed homes.55,000 soldiers were deployed to affected areas to help with the clean-up efforts.By the evening of September 7, the government had counted 2,721 damaged homes.\n\nIn Haiti, flooding one meter deep sat in residential neighborhoods in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives.Mudslides, destroyed homes, flooded crops, and infrastructure damage were reported in the northern part of the country.The total expanse of the flooding stretched from Môle-Saint-Nicolas in the west to the eastern border with the Dominican Republic.\n\nOn the evening of September 7, at 7:30 pm AST (23:30 UTC), Hurricane Irma reached the Turks and Caicos Islands.While the eye passed just south of the main islands, crossing over South Caicos and the Ambergris Cays, the most powerful winds on the northern side of the eye swept all of the islands for more than two hours.Communications infrastructure was destroyed.\n\nOn September 8, Minister of Infrastructure Goldray Ewing confirmed that damage to Providenciales was extensive, with the northwestern neighborhood of Blue Hill being ""gone"".The hospital in the capital, Cockburn Town, was heavily damaged.On South Caicos, 75% of roofs were lost.Total damage was estimated at over $500 million.\n\nIn the Bahamas, the eye of the storm passed over Duncan Town, the major settlement of the Ragged Islands chain, on September 8.It also passed ""almost directly over"" Inagua and South Acklins, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.\n\nDamages were largely confined to the southern islands starting the morning of September 8.On Mayaguana and Great Inagua, downed power lines knocked out communications.On Great Inagua, 70% of homes sustained roof damage, and the island\'s school lost its roof entirely.The Morton Salt Company\'s signature production facility, one of the major employers in the country, experienced millions of dollars in damages.The Acklins settlement of Salina Point was cut off from the rest of the island by flooding, while Crooked Island had widespread roof damage.In the northern Bahamas, the worst property damage came on September 10 as the outer bands of the system produced tornadic activity on Grand Bahama and Bimini.Damage and losses across The Bahamas amounted to $135 million.\n\nWhile Irma was making landfall in Florida, the ocean was drawn away from some western shorelines of the Bahamas due to strong easterly winds.\n\nEarly on September 9, Irma made landfall on the Camagüey Archipelago off the northern coast of Cuba, with sustained winds of .The strongest official sustained wind speed was , while the highest wind gust reached ; both were observed near Camila in Ciego de Ávila Province.The weather station at Esmeralda, Camagüey, was damaged, with the wind gauge destroyed.The north coast of Cuba experienced significant coastal flooding due to storm surge and abnormally high tides generated by the storm.Wave heights at Cayo Romano exceeded .Storm surge penetrated as far as inland in some areas of Villa Clara Province.Multiple locations on the island observed at least of rainfall, with a peak total of of precipitation at Topes de Collantes.\n\nA total of 158,554 homes experienced some degree of damage, of which 14,657 were destroyed; approximately 1.9 million people experienced the direct effects of Irma.The storm partially deroofed 103,691 homes, while 23,560 were completely deroofed.Irma damaged or destroyed 980 health facilities and 2,264 schools.Approximately 3.1 million people experienced disruptions to the water supply, while 246,707 people lost telephone service.About of roads were damaged.Crops also suffered extensively, with nearly affected by the storm.Throughout the country, the hurricane inflicted $13.185 billion in damage and killed 10 people, making Irma the costliest tropical cyclone in Cuban history.\n\nThe tourist areas of Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and Cayo Santa María and the nearby town of Caibarién received the brunt of the storm, with waves rolling through town and the characteristic one-story homes completely flooded.The storm most severely Ciego de Ávila and Villa Clara provinces.Flooding worsened as the hurricane moved west, pushing the storm surge along to the regions around Havana.By the afternoon, limited flooding was occurring in Havana, including around the Malecón.Portions of province coastal flooding surpassing that which was experienced during the Storm of the Century in 1993 and Hurricane Wilma in 2005.In the city of Santa Clara, 39 buildings collapsed.Rainfall resulted in several rivers reaching major flood stage.The town of Cabaiguán in Sancti Spíritus Province in particular suffered extensive inland flooding after the Zaza River swelled.\n\nHurricane Irma directly affected a major colony of American flamingos on Cuba\'s northern Cayo Coco.Early reports from Diario de Cuba indicated that several hundred flamingos had been killed by the storm, though other estimates ranged as high as several thousand birds.\n\nHurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida.Except for the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned.Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba, but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys.The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States.After surveying the aftermath of Irma, Florida governor Rick Scott said ""I thought we would see more damage""[on the mainland] but said ""he witnessed devastation in the Keys"".President Donald Trump commented on Twitter that the devastation in some places was ""far greater than anyone thought"".\n\nDamage in the United States was estimated at a minimum of $50 billion.At the time, Irma was the fourth costliest tropical cyclone in the United States, behind hurricanes Sandy in 2012, Harvey earlier that year, and Katrina in 2005.However, later in September 2017, Hurricane Maria became the third costliest United States tropical cyclone, causing Irma to fall to the fifth costliest.At least 92 people, 10 directly and 82 indirectly, died throughout the United States in relation to Irma: 84 in Florida, 3 in Georgia, 3 in South Carolina, and 2 in North Carolina.\n\nIrma struck the state less than two weeks after Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten had caused the worst flooding seen in western Florida in 20 years, which further worsened the impacts in the region.The storm\'s large wind field resulted in strong winds across much of Florida, except for the western Panhandle.The highest reported sustained wind speed was on Marco Island, while the strongest observed wind gust was , recorded near Naples, though wind gusts of likely occurred in the Middle Florida Keys.More than 7.7 million homes and businesses in Florida were left without electricity at some point – approximately 73% of state.Generally heavy amounts of rainfall were recorded to the east of the Irma\'s path, including a peak total of in Fort Pierce.Heavy precipitation – and storm surge, in some instances – overflowed at least 32 rivers and creeks, causing significant flooding, particularly along the St. Johns River and its tributaries.Many homes and businesses suffered damage or destruction, with more than 65,000 structures damaged to some degree in West Central and Southwest Florida alone.Agriculture experienced about $2.5 billion in damage.It was estimated that the cyclone caused at least $50 billion in damage, making Irma the costliest hurricane in Florida history, surpassing Hurricane Andrew, until it was itself surpassed by Hurricane Ian, 5 years later.\n\nThroughout Florida, at least 84 people died in storm-related incidents.About half of the deaths occurred from drowning, trauma, and carbon monoxide poisoning.Broward County had 21 fatalities, the most of any county in Florida.Among those deaths were 12 people at The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, a Hollywood nursing home.The patients died from sweltering heat worsened by the lack of air conditioning.The hurricane also left at least 14 deaths in Monroe County; 6 deaths in Orange County; 5 deaths each in Duval, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties; 4 deaths in both Highlands and Hillsborough counties; 3 deaths in both Marion and Polk counties; 2 deaths each in Collier, Hardee, Leon, Pinellas, St. Lucie, and Taylor counties; and 1 death in Hendry, Lake, Lee, Liberty, Manatee, Nassau, Okeechobee, Pasco, Seminole, St. Johns, and Volusia counties.\n\nWith Irma making landfall in Monroe County as a Category 4 hurricane, the Florida Keys were hardest hit area in the state.Strong winds and storm surge flooding caused major damage to buildings, trailer parks, boats, roads, the electricity supply, mobile phone coverage, internet access, sanitation, the water supply and the fuel supply throughout the island chain.An estimated storm surge occurred at Cudjoe Key, where Irma made landfall.Throughout the island, 625 homes sustained minor damage, 52 sustained major damage, and 81 were demolished.On Big Pine Key, one of the most devastated islands, 633 homes received minor impact, 299 homes received major impact, and 473 homes were completely destroyed.Overall in Monroe County, 27,649 homes experienced some degree of damage, including 1,179 homes being destroyed, 2,977 homes receiving major damage, and 5,361 suffering minor damage.\n\nAfter devastating the Keys, the storm then struck Collier County as a Category 3 hurricane.Several communities in the county suffered extensive damage, especially along the coast.Throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, 65 homes, including 44 mobile homes, were demolished, while 1,008 homes received major damage.Property damages in unincorporated areas alone reach about $320 million.Lee County was lashed by strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused prolonged flooding in some areas.More than 24,000 homes suffered some degree of damage, with almost 3,000 homes receiving major damage and 89 homes being destroyed.Damage in the county totaled about $857 million.\n\nImpact in much of the Miami metropolitan area was generally limited to extensive tree and fence damage, as well as widespread power outages.However, in Miami-Dade County, about 1,000 homes received major damage and about 50% of crops were lost.Storm surge caused coastal flooding from Homestead to Downtown Miami, as well as in portions of Miami Beach.Parts of the Florida Heartland were devastated by high winds and flooding, particularly Hendry and Highlands counties.In the former, which has most citrus trees of any county in Florida, about 60% of orange crops were lost.Throughout Hendry County, a total of 451 homes had minor damage, 131 homes suffered major damage, and 42 others were destroyed.In Highlands County, 13,138 businesses and homes were damaged to some degree, with 144 being destroyed, 963 sustaining major damage, and 2,408 receiving minor damage.In Orange County, wind gusts reached 79 mph at Orlando International Airport.A wind gust of 91 mph was also recorded in Orlando at the top of the Disney Contemporary Resort.Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central Florida left some wind damage and flooding, necessitating evacuations and rescues, including more than 200 people in Orlo Vista after hundreds of homes were flooded.A total of 2,999 business or homes were damaged in Lake County, 7,430 in Seminole County, and 3,457 in Volusia County.Additionally, eight tornadoes touched down in Brevard County, all of which caused damage.\n\nAlong much of the Gulf Coast of Florida, to the north of where Irma made landfall, negative storm surges were observed, with water retracting rather than pushing inland, causing little coastal flooding.However, on the opposite coast, extensive erosion and storm surge flooding occurred in the First Coast, especially in Duval and St. Johns counties.In Duval County, the St. Johns River crested at heights that exceeded records set during Hurricane Dora in 1964.Portions of Jacksonville experienced flooding, particularly the downtown area and the Riverside and San Marco neighborhoods, with about 350 people rescued in those sections of the city.Water reached about high in some homes.The city of Jacksonville suffered about $85 million in damage.\n\nIn St. Johns County, storm surge left extensive damage to oceanfront properties in Ponte Vedra Beach and Vilano Beach, with several becoming uninhabitable.Additionally, some riverfront businesses in St. Augustine\'s historic district were flooded due to storm surge from the Matanzas River.In nearby Clay County, rainfall and storm surge combined to cause extensive flooding along portions of the Black Creek and the St. Johns River, with record high crests at several locations along the former.About 350 people and 75 animals were rescued from floodwaters throughout the county.A total of 275 homes were destroyed, 175 were inflicted major damage, and 124 received minor damage.\n\nThree deaths were reported in Georgia due to falling trees and debris, along with widespread wind damage and power outages throughout the state primarily due to fallen trees.On Tybee Island, as well as St. Simons Island the storm surge caused extensive flooding.The tropical storm also did $54 million in damage in the state.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the third highest storm surge on record was recorded, reaching a height of approximately .By of September 12, almost 100,000 had lost power in Upstate South Carolina.Five people died in storm-related incidents across South Carolina, all from indirect incidents.The tropical storm caused damages totaling $500,000 in the state.\n\nLight damage occurred in other areas, including Tennessee.About 75,000 customers in North Carolina lost power due to Irma.It also caused $600,000 in damages in Alabama.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Irma\'s path through the West Indies and Caribbean, the devastation to roads, harbors and airports significantly impeded the transportation and distribution of relief supplies.Foreign countries moved to provide much of the initial aid.The British, Dutch, French, and United States governments sent warships and planes with supplies and manpower to the region.International leaders, including Dutch King Willem-Alexander and French President Emmanuel Macron, quickly moved to visit affected territories.\n\nSome of the affected countries and territories also offered assistance to each other.Cuba, which sustained extensive damage from the storm, sent 750 health workers to Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, Dominica, and Haiti.Government officials and members of the public in Puerto Rico delivered assistance and evacuated people stranded on other islands.The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services granted special 30-day humanitarian visas for British Virgin Islanders to stay in Puerto Rico.Hundreds of people stranded on Saint Martin were flown to the Dominican Republic on humanitarian grounds.\n\nIn response to Hurricane Jose\'s approach, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a mandatory evacuation on September 9 for any remaining residents on Barbuda.A Miami cargo plane landed on Antigua later that day, carrying over 60 tons (120,000 lbs) of relief supplies for the displaced storm victims—including bottled water, canned food and power generators.\n\nRFA Mounts Bay stationed itself near Anguilla and provided support and relief work to the island with its helicopters and 40 marines and army engineers.The ship delivered 6 tonnes of emergency aid to Anguilla and army engineers repaired a fuel leak at Anguilla\'s main petrol dump, restored power to the island\'s hospital and provided shelters for those left homeless by the hurricane.The ship arrived in the British Virgin Islands on September 8, 2017, to provide emergency relief to the islands, including providing shelters, food and water.HMS Ocean was diverted from the Mediterranean to provide relief from Gibraltar to the affected British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos on September 7, and aid was also supplied by the Department for International Development from their disaster response centre at Kemble Airfield.As part of a £32 million operation named Operation Ruman, nearly 500 UK military personnel with emergency relief were dispatched from RAF Brize Norton.This included the first deployment of No. 38 Expeditionary Air Wing with 3 RAF aircraft; 2 Airbus A400M Atlas and 1 C130J hercules to support relief efforts.\n\nThe British government also drafted 2 members of the UK police calibre into the region on September 10, and 53 police officers were drafted from RAF Brize Norton to the affected British Overseas Territories on September 15 to help maintain order.UK politicians, including the chairs of the foreign affairs and development select committees, criticized both the government\'s preparations for the storm and its response as inadequate.\n\nBy September 12, the Department for International Development had delivered more than 40 tonnes of aid into the region, including into Turks and Caicos, and 1,000 UK military troops were deployed in the region as part of relief efforts.The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, pledged an additional £25 million worth of funding as part of relief efforts in the region on September 13, 2017, and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Boris Johnson, said that a further 250 UK military personnel would be deployed into the area within the next few days.Anguilla\'s Chief Minister, Victor Banks, praised the British government\'s response to the storm and said that Boris Johnson\'s visit to the island ""sends a very positive signal to Anguillans that the British are serious about their response to this very severe hurricane"", but went on to say that the current financial commitment from the UK was not substantial enough.\n\nBy September 15, the United Kingdom had over 70 military personnel and 4 police officers in Anguilla and had delivered 15 tonnes of aid to the island.In the British Virgin Islands, Royal Marines had cleared the airfield so that it was operational for the delivery of aid into the islands, with more than 200 British military personnel and 54 UK police officers on the ground and 8 tonnes of aid delivered to the islands.120 British military personnel were on the ground in Turks and Caicos, and over 150 shelter kits and 720 liters of water were delivered to the islands on September 15.\n\nAmendments to international aid rules by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (or OECD) allowed for the UK government to provide access to £13 billion worth of aid to the affected British Overseas Territories, through the UK\'s Official Development Assistance (ODA) by November 2017.\n\nBy the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage.The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by Irma\'s eye, remained largely inaccessible for days.Assessments showed that 15% of the national telecommunications network had been affected, with at least one tower destroyed.Bahamasair resumed a limited domestic schedule on September 10, with international flights still cancelled due to existing and anticipated destruction at other destinations.\n\nThe worst devastation occurred on Ragged Island, over which Irma\'s eye had directly passed.After days of the National Emergency Management Agency not being able to physically reach the island, officials were finally able to inspect it; they promptly declared it uninhabitable.Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said that it was the worst disaster area he or his officials had ever seen, and that all remaining residents would need to leave, potentially permanently.Business leaders and other officials called for a new long-term development model to shift the population away from such sparsely-settled islands.\n\nOn Grand Bahama and Bimini, where tornadoes associated with Irma touched down on September 10, more than 100 people were left displaced.Infrastructure damage included docks, parks, and the power system.\n\nAside from tangible asset losses, Irma brought significant economic damages.International freight shipping was projected to be offline for a week, and costs for rebuilding supplies were inflated due to demand in the U.S.\n\nSwollen rivers contributed to worsening flooding in the days after the storm system left, resulting in additional evacuations.Officials resorted to using inflatable rafts to access affected areas.The national electrical infrastructure was said to be extensively damaged.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, flooding worsened following Irma\'s departure, leading the number of displaced persons to increase to more than 24,000 by September 8.President Danilo Medina ordered further evacuations due to at-risk dams, while the government banned swimming in rivers and ordered boats kept in port.More than 422,000 people were left without water due to 28 aqueducts being damaged.\n\nIn Haiti, officials stated that losses were greater than they could have been since people largely did not heed early preparation and evacuation warnings.At least 5,000 homes were flooded.One man died trying to cross a flooded river; another went missing and 17 were injured.The trash- and waste-contaminated floodwaters in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives led to fears of cholera outbreaks.Flooding continued to worsen days after the storm, as runoff from the mountains swelled rivers in low-lying farming communities.United Nations peacekeepers from Brazil were able to gain access to the flooded northwest region to provide urgent aid, but non-governmental organizations and Haitian economists warned that the estimated 30,000 victims would need longer-term assistance as well.Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant appointed a government commission to address Irma\'s effects, with Action Against Hunger in charge of humanitarian coordination.\n\nIn the USVI, residents and tourists alike were described as being in a state of traumatic shock.By September 7, the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship had arrived in the USVI to provide supplies, damage assessment, and evacuation assistance.Four additional warships, some of which had already been on their way to Texas to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief, were redirected to the region.At a September 10 news conference, Governor Kenneth Mapp described Irma as a ""horrific disaster"" for which ""[t]here will be no restorations or solutions in days or weeks.""The Federal Emergency Management Agency airlifted in goods for residents, who were subjected to a curfew.Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line agreed to transport tourists to Florida, contingent upon port availability following the state\'s own experience with Irma.\n\nOn Saint John, described as ""perhaps the site of Irma\'s worst devastation on American soil,"" it took six days for an active-theater disaster zone to be established, leading to criticism of the U.S. government response.The National Guard was delayed in reaching Saint John due to the number of overturned boats left in the harbor.The National Guard was brought in to maintain order, while the Coast Guard brought evacuees to cruise ships bound for San Juan and Miami.There was still no electricity on St. John in the middle of October 2017.\n\nBy September 9, more than one million Puerto Ricans were still without power, tens of thousands were without water, and several thousand were still in shelters.Hospitals were operating on generator power.The government was struggling to establish contact with the islands of Culebra and Vieques.By September 10, the main island had recovered enough to serve as a refuge for people stranded on other islands, including 1,200 tourists from Saint Martin and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Airlifts had brought more than 50 patients to Puerto Rico.\n\nFive months after Irma, two-thirds of the hospital beds on Saint Thomas were still unavailable, due to extensive physical damage and staffing shortages.\n\nDamage to Sint Maarten\'s harbour and to Princess Juliana International Airport left the Dutch part of Saint Martin unreachable, although the smaller Grand Case-Espérance Airport on the French side could be reopened by September 7 for supply aid by helicopter and airplane.The French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops on board a CASA/IPTN CN-235 aircraft.\n\nThe following day, the Dutch military was able to airlift dialysis patients off the island while also dropping leaflets to warn islanders about the rapidly approaching Hurricane Jose.Although the airport was closed, 435 students and faculty of the American University of the Caribbean were evacuated by the U.S. military.On September 10, Dutch King Willem-Alexander departed for the region, with intentions to visit Sint Maarten and other affected Dutch territories and commonwealth members.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron followed this announcement by stating his intentions to visit the French part of the island on September 12 in order to bring aid supplies.In response to criticism of the French handling of the disaster, 1,000 troops, police, and other emergency workers were sent to Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.\n\nOn both sides of Saint Martin, desperate conditions combined with food and water shortages in Irma\'s aftermath led to reports of violence, scavenging, and theft.In response, the French government increased its troop deployment to 2,200 and the Dutch government sent more than 600 military and police personnel.\n\nThe day after the hurricane hit Saint Barthelemy the French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops into the reopened Grand Case-Espérance Airport.On September 7 and 9, equipment and personnel were flown from France to Guadeloupe and Martinique.\n\nSporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm.\n\nOn September 11, Florida Governor Rick Scott conducted an aerial tour to survey the damage to the Keys.The Overseas Highway remained closed while authorities assessed the integrity of the 42 bridges along the route.Residents returning to the Keys were faced with a police roadblock, to the south of Florida City.USS Iwo Jima, USS New York and aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were sent to the Keys area to aid with the recovery.\n\nOn September 12, some residents were allowed to return into the Keys as far as Islamorada.Although road damage blocked entry any farther than Islamorada, bridges had been inspected and found safe to Sugarloaf Key.By late on September 12, the Overseas Highway had been repaired and the bridges inspected as safe for first responders to travel to Key West.On September 16, residents were free to return to Marathon.Residents were allowed to return to Key West the following day, although the Keys remained closed to tourists and a checkpoint remained in place in Florida City.\n\nDue mainly to the widespread loss of power, cell phone service was also reduced after battery backup power for cell phone towers ran out and backup generators ran out of fuel.In an impact report by the FCC, as of 11 AM EDT on September 12, 89 of 108 (82%) cell phone towers were non-functioning in Monroe County (Florida Keys), 154 of 212 (73%) were non-functioning in Collier County (Naples), 36 of 46 (78%) were non-functioning in Hendry County, and an additional six counties had 41-60% of cell phone towers not functioning, including Lee County (Fort Myers) and Miami-Dade County.\n\nNOAA released map-format aerial reconnaissance image data of damage from the storm.The imagery featured several areas of Florida: including the Florida Keys, the southwest coast of Florida from Marco Island to Punta Gorda, much of the northeast coast of Florida, and portions of the Jacksonville area.Portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts were also photographed.Additionally, the Sun-Sentinel published before and after photos of several landmarks in the Florida Keys.\n\nIn the days after the hurricane, due to the heavy rainfall, numerous rivers had flooded, including residential areas.Public health risks, such as diarrheal infections and mosquito-borne illnesses, remain from the flooding that resulted in the aftermath of the hurricane.A large concern from flooding is contamination because people become exposed to dirty floodwaters and the potential for contaminated water to enter the local water supply is significant.One example of an illness that can enter the water supply is leptospirosis, which is rat urine carries into the floodwaters.Untreated exposure to leptospirosis can cause kidney damage, meningitis, and liver failure.Noroviruses and other infections are also a risk.\n\nFollowing Irma\'s passage, a hand-carved wooden canoe was discovered on the banks of the Indian River and could be several hundred years old.The state has removed the canoe for examination and safe keeping.\n\nDue to Irma\'s and Hurricane Harvey\'s impact in Florida and Texas, U.S. employment declined in September 2017 for the first time since September 2010.The leisure and hospitality industries were especially hard hit, losing 111,000 jobs in September.\n\nIrma set multiple records for intensity, especially at easterly longitudes, time spent at such an intensity, and its intensity at landfall.When Irma reached Category 5 intensity with winds of at 11:45 UTC on September 5 at 57.7°W, it became the easternmost Atlantic hurricane of this strength on record, surpassing Hurricane David of 1979, later beaten by Hurricane Lorenzo 2 years later.By 00:15 UTC on September 6, Irma reached peak intensity with () winds and a minimum pressure of .This ties it with Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and Hurricane Rita of 2005 as the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed.Only five other Atlantic hurricanes have been recorded with wind speeds higher than Irma: Hurricane Allen of 1980, which had maximum sustained winds of , and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Gilbert of 1988, Hurricane Wilma of 2005, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, all of which had peak winds of .At the time, Irma was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; later surpassed by Hurricane Dorian, and was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007.In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category 5 strength winds, and the third-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, with a value of 64.9 units.Only the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane and Hurricane Ivan in 2004 achieved higher values.\n\nOn September 6, Irma made landfall on the islands of Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Virgin Gorda at peak strength.This ties Irma with cyclones Monica of 2006 and Winston of 2016, and typhoons Zeb of 1998 and Megi of 2010 as the seventh-strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall globally – in terms of sustained winds – trailing only Typhoon Goni of 2020 which bore winds of at landfall, Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 and Typhoon Meranti of 2016, which bore winds of at landfall, and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Typhoon Joan of 1959, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, which bore winds of at landfall.Irma is second to the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin, and is the first hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic at Category 5 status since Felix in 2007.Irma is the first recorded Category 5 hurricane to affect the northern Leeward Islands, and was one of the worst storms to hit the region on record, along with Hurricane Donna in 1960 and Hurricane Luis in 1995.In addition, Irma is only the second hurricane on record to make landfall in Cuba at Category 5 intensity, with the other being a hurricane in 1924.Furthermore, when Irma made landfall on Barbuda, Saint Martin, Virgin Gorda, and Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane, it became one of only two recorded Atlantic storms to make landfall in multiple nations at this strength; the other was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which struck both Eleuthera and the United States as a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nIrma made landfall in the Florida Keys with winds of and a pressure of , making it the strongest hurricane to strike Florida in terms of wind speed since Charley in 2004, and the most intense to strike the state in terms of barometric pressure since Andrew in 1992.In the span of two weeks, two Category 4 hurricanes—Harvey and Irma—struck the continental United States, the first time on record two Atlantic tropical cyclones of such strength made landfall on the country in the same hurricane season.This also marked only the third occurrence of two consecutive Atlantic storms making landfall in the United States as major hurricanes.The other two instances were the Great Charleston and Cheniere Caminada hurricanes in 1893, and hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne in 2004.\n\nBecause of the extensive damage and loss of life the hurricane caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Irma from its rotating naming lists in April 2018, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane.It was replaced with Idalia for the 2023

40,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Hurricane Irma', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'Hurricane Irma was an extremely powerful Cape Verde hurricane that caused widespread destruction across its path in early September 2017.Irma was the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the Leeward Islands on record, followed by Maria two weeks later.At the time, it was considered the most powerful hurricane on record in the open Atlantic region, outside of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, until it was surpassed by Hurricane Dorian two years later.It was also the third-strongest Atlantic hurricane at landfall ever recorded, just behind the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane and Dorian.The ninth named storm, fourth hurricane, second major hurricane, and first Category 5 hurricane of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Irma caused widespread and catastrophic damage throughout its long lifetime, particularly in the northeastern Caribbean and the Florida Keys.It was also the most intense hurricane to strike the continental United States since Katrina in 2005, the first major hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Wilma in the same year, and the first Category 4 hurricane to strike the state since Charley in 2004.The word Irmageddon was coined soon after the hurricane to describe the damage caused by the hurricane.\n\nIrma developed from a tropical wave near the Cape Verde Islands on August 30.Favorable conditions allowed Irma to rapidly intensify into a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson wind scale by late on August 31.The storm\'s intensity fluctuated between Categories 2 and 3 for the next several days, due to a series of eyewall replacement cycles.On September 4, Irma resumed intensifying, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by early on the next day.Early on September 6, Irma peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of and a minimum pressure of .Irma was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017 in terms of barometric pressure, and the strongest worldwide in 2017 in terms of wind speed.Another eyewall replacement cycle caused Irma to weaken back to a Category 4 hurricane, but the storm re-attained Category 5 status before making landfall in Cuba.Although Irma briefly weakened to a Category 2 storm while making landfall on Cuba, the system re-intensified to Category 4 status as it crossed the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, before making landfall on Cudjoe Key on September 10.Irma then weakened to Category 3 status, prior to another landfall in Florida on Marco Island later that day.The system degraded into a remnant low over Alabama and ultimately dissipated on September 13 over Missouri.\n\nThe storm caused catastrophic damage in Barbuda, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Anguilla, and the Virgin Islands as a Category 5 hurricane.The hurricane caused at least 134 deaths: one in Anguilla; one in Barbados; three in Barbuda; four in the British Virgin Islands; 10 in Cuba; 11 in the French West Indies; one in Haiti; three in Puerto Rico; four on the Dutch side of Sint Maarten; 92 in the contiguous United States, and four in the U.S. Virgin Islands.Hurricane Irma was the top Google searched term in the U.S. and globally in 2017.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa on August 26.The tropical wave moved off the coast of the continent late on August 27.Throughout the next two days, showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low-pressure area, as the system passed just south of and then through the Cape Verde Islands on August 29.Around 00:00 UTC on the following day, the system developed into a tropical depression just west of the Cape Verde Islands.Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Irma, based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates.With warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, strengthening was anticipated, with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier air.\n\nThe nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow, as an anticyclone became established over the system, with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images.Early on August 31, shortly after the development of a central dense overcast (CDO) and an eye feature, Irma underwent rapid intensification, becoming a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 UTC and then a Category 3 hurricane, becoming a major hurricane – around 00:00 UTC on September 1.Within a 48-hour period, the hurricane\'s intensity had increased by .On September 2, a ship passed to the west of the center of Irma, recording maximum winds of , which indicated that the eye of Irma remained compact.A strong high pressure system to the north of Irma caused the storm to move west-southwestward between September 2 and September 4.The first aircraft reconnaissance mission departed from Barbados on the afternoon of September 3, discovering an eye in diameter and surface winds of .\n\nOn September 4, after moving into more favorable conditions, Irma strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane.As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by 12:00 UTC on the following day, with winds of .The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at near 18:00 UTC on September 5. Irma acquired annular characteristics around this time, with the storm exhibiting a large, symmetric CDO and an impressive satellite appearance.Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern Leeward Islands.Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of Barbuda at peak intensity, with the storm\'s central minimum pressure having bottomed out at – this was the lowest in the Atlantic since Dean in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of .Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15 UTC on Sint Maarten, and at 16:30 UTC on Virgin Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands, though the storm\'s central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall.\n\nAs the hurricane moved away from the Virgin Islands late on September 6, observations from reconnaissance flights, as well as Doppler radar in San Juan, Puerto Rico, indicated an elliptical eye and double eyewalls.Late on September 6, the cyclone passed about north of Puerto Rico.Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of Hispaniola throughout the day on September 7.After beginning an eyewall replacement cycle, Irma weakened to a Category 4 hurricane as it passed south of the Turks and Caicos Islands early on September 8.This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category 5 intensity, the second-longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above – behind only the 1932 Cuba hurricane.At 05:00 UTC on September 8, Irma made landfall on the island of Little Inagua in the Bahamas with sustained winds of .The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a subtropical ridge to its north.Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category 5 intensity at 18:00 UTC that day east of Cuba as deep convection became more pronounced and organized.The hurricane then made landfall in Cayo Romano, Cuba, at 03:00 UTC on September 9, with winds of .This made Irma only the second Category 5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the 1924 Cuba hurricane.As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category 2 storm later on September 9.\n\nAfter slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards Florida around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental United States.Moving over the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, Irma quickly restrengthened to a Category 4 hurricane at 06:00 UTC on September 10, as deep convection improved and the eye became better defined.In addition, Irma\'s wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of and gale-force winds spanning in diameter.The cyclone made landfall in Cudjoe Key, Florida, at 13:00 UTC on September 10, at Category 4 intensity, with winds of .Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category 3 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30 UTC, in Marco Island, Florida, with sustained winds of .Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category 3 intensity hours after landfall.Passing east of Tampa as a weakening Category 1 hurricane around 06:00 UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation – though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds.The system finally weakened to a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC that day as it entered southern Georgia, while acquiring some extratropical characteristics.At 06:00 UTC on September 12, Irma degenerated to a remnant low just as it entered Alabama, as most of the deep convection had diminished.The remnants persisted for another day or so before dissipating over Missouri on September 13.\n\nGiven that Irma\'s forecast track was along much of the Caribbean island chain, hurricane warnings were issued for the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and parts of Hispaniola on September 5.\n\nIn Antigua and Barbuda, residents safeguarded their homes and cleaned up their properties in anticipation of strong winds.Emergency crews were put on standby at public shelters and hospitals by September 5 to assist with any evacuations.Expecting a direct hit, more than half of the residents on Barbuda took shelter, and relief supplies were preemptively mobilized.The National Emergency Management Organization on Saint Lucia urged small craft operators and swimmers to be mindful of forecasts for high surf.Small Craft Warnings and High Surf Advisories were hoisted for Dominica, where residents were urged to remain vigilant of the potential for high waves, landslides, and flooding.\n\nIn Guadeloupe, low-lying and cliff-edge homes were evacuated at the threat of flooding and erosion.Schools and public businesses closed on September 5 and 6.Hospitals stocked up on three days\' worth of supplies and checked the functionality of their generators.Of the island\'s 32 communes, 22 activated their emergency plans; 1,500 people were urged to take shelter.The island sustained relatively minor damage and became the base for relief efforts on Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.Though the core of the hurricane was expected to remain north of the island, a yellow alert was issued for Martinique due to the likelihood of rough seas.The island dispatched relief supplies and military reinforcements to its neighboring islands of Guadeloupe, Saint Martin.and Saint Barthélemy, which faced a greater risk of a direct impact.\n\nOn September 4, Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency.By September 6, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency had deployed response teams in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.Supplies, including food rations, medical supplies, and blankets, were pre-staged in strategic locations on the islands for distribution.\n\nOn September 5, the Dominican Republic activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage; the United States and Haiti followed suit two days later.According to officials, 11,200 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas prior to the storm\'s arrival.Approximately 7,400 tourists were moved to Santo Domingo, away from beach resorts.In Haiti, government officials and aid organizations struggled with early preparation and evacuation efforts.While some officials blamed reluctance and indifference on the part of the population, others ""admitted they were not prepared for the onslaught and no mandatory evacuation orders were in place ahead of Irma\'s approach.""Local officials contended that they had not received promised funds, supplies, or equipment from the national government.The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti prepared its 1,000 peacekeepers and engineers to assist.\n\nIn the Turks and Caicos, evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas starting September 5. Schools were closed, government buildings were boarded up, and shelters were opened.Officials spread warnings to residents in English, Creole, and Spanish via social media, radio, SMS text, and WhatsApp.In The Bahamas, the government began preparations the week prior to the hurricane\'s arrival, including securing national sports facilities to use as shelters.By September 7, the government had evacuated 1,609 people by air from the southern islands, including 365 from Bimini.Controlled cutting of the power supply to southern and central Bahamian islands was conducted in advance of the storm.Shelters were made available, though usage was low due to most evacuees staying with family on other islands.Of the 2,679 foreign tourists still in The Bahamas on September 7, about 1,200 were being housed at Atlantis Paradise Island, one of the most hurricane-ready structures in the country.\n\nIn Cuba, meteorologists did not initially predict a direct hit.Fuel conservation was enacted in Camagüey Province to ensure that enough would be available during post-storm power outages.The Civil Defense evacuated nearly one million people from low-lying areas, including thousands of Canadian and European tourists in the Jardines del Rey.Dolphins at a Cayo Guillermo resort were evacuated by helicopter.\n\nThe NHC issued several watches and warnings for the Southeastern United States.The first watches and warnings were issued at 15:00 UTC on September 7, which was a hurricane watch from the Jupiter Inlet to Bonita Beach, including the Florida Keys and Lake Okeechobee.The watches and warnings were extended into Georgia and South Carolina on September 9.At 21:00 UTC on that day, the advisories reached their maximum extent, with a hurricane warning covering the entire east coast of the state, the west coast from Indian Pass southward, and the Florida Keys; a hurricane watch was in place from the Florida–Georgia state line to Edisto Beach, South Carolina; and there were two tropical storm warnings, one in Florida from Indian Pass to the Okaloosa–Walton county line and the other from the Florida–Georgia state line to the South Santee River in South Carolina.Watches and warnings were gradually discontinued as Irma moved inland and weakened, with all of them canceled by early on September 12.\n\nOn September 4, Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency.Governor Scott placed 100 members of the Florida National Guard on duty to assist in preparations.All 7,000 troops were ordered to be on duty by September 8.Officials advised residents to stock their hurricane kits.The state coordinated with electrical companies in order for power outages to be restored as quickly as possible, extending resources such as equipment, fuel, and lodging for the approximately 24,000 restoration personnel who had been activated.Governor Scott suspended tolls on all toll roads in Florida, including the turnpike.All state offices in Florida were closed from September 8 to September 11, while public schools, state colleges, and state universities in all 67 counties were closed during the same period.The Florida Department of Education coordinated with school districts as the need for transportation by school buses and opening shelters arose.By September 9, more than 150 state parks were closed.Throughout the state, almost 700 emergency shelters were opened.The shelters collectively housed about 191,764 people, with more than 40% of them staying in a shelter in South Florida.Additionally, more than 60 special needs shelters were opened, which housed more than 5,000 people by September 9.\n\nMany airports across the state, particularly in Central and South Florida, were closed.Nearly 9,000 flights intending to arrive in or depart from Florida were canceled.Along Florida\'s coasts, most seaports were closed or opened with restricted access.For the fifth time in its 45-year history, the Walt Disney World Resort was completely closed due to the storm.Its theme parks, water parks, and Disney Springs were all closed by 9:00 p.m. on September 9 and remained closed until September 12.Other Orlando-area theme parks, including Universal Orlando Resort and SeaWorld Orlando, were also closed.The Kennedy Space Center was closed from September 8 to September 15.\n\nAn estimated 6.5 million Floridians were ordered to evacuate, mostly those living on barrier islands or in coastal areas; in mobile or sub-standard homes; and in low-lying or flood prone areas.Mandatory evacuations were ordered for portions of Brevard, Broward, Citrus, Collier, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Glades, Hendry, Hernando, Indian River, Lee, Martin, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Lucie, Sumter, and Volusia counties.All of Monroe County, where the Florida Keys are located, was placed under a mandatory evacuation.Residents in communities near the southern half of Lake Okeechobee were also ordered to leave.Additionally, voluntary evacuation notices were issued for all or parts of Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Charlotte, Columbia, Desoto, Hardee, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lake, Manatee, Okeechobee, Osceola, and Polk counties.\n\nA record 6.5 million Floridians evacuated, making it the largest evacuation in the state\'s history.Evacuees caused significant traffic congestion on northbound Interstate 95, Interstate 75, and Florida\'s Turnpike, exacerbated by the fact that the entire Florida peninsula was within the cone of uncertainty in the NHC\'s forecast path in the days before the storm, so evacuees from both coasts headed north, as evacuees would not be safer by fleeing to the opposite coast.Fuel was in short supply throughout peninsular Florida during the week before Irma\'s arrival, especially along evacuation routes, leading to hours-long lines at fuel stations and even escorts of fuel trucks by the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nUse of the left shoulder as a lane for moving traffic was allowed on northbound Interstate 75 from Wildwood to the Georgia state line beginning September 8 and on eastbound Interstate 4 from Tampa to State Road 429 near Celebration for a few hours on September 9.It was the first time that the shoulder-use plan, which was introduced at the start of the 2017 hurricane season, was implemented by the state for hurricane evacuations.The shoulder-use plan was implemented in place of labor- and resource-intensive contraflow lane reversal, in which both sides of an interstate highway are used for one direction of traffic.\n\nOfficials from the Environmental Protection Agency, which had been criticized for its response to Hurricane Harvey, took special measures to inspect and secure hazardous materials, especially at Superfund sites.Direct Relief, a disaster relief organization, coordinated with local health centers and provided resources to help facilities on the front lines of Floridian and Puerto Rican communities.\n\nGeorgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency initially for all six coastal counties on September 6, but eventually expanded the declaration to 94 counties south of Atlanta metropolitan area, and then the entire state on September 10.Atlanta was placed under its first-ever tropical storm warning.Governor Deal ordered mandatory evacuations for all areas east of Interstate 95 on September 7, before extending the order to the entirety of Chatham County and low-lying areas west of I-95 on the following day.In total, 540,000 people on the Georgia coast were ordered to leave.Contraflow lane reversal for Interstate 16 took effect on the morning of September 9 from Savannah to Dublin, Georgia.All Georgia state parks were open for free to evacuees, as was the 800-acre camping area at Atlanta Motor Speedway.Reversible HOT lanes on Interstate 75 in Georgia through south metro Atlanta were open 24 hours northbound with no tolls.\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on September 6, with South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster following suit the same day.Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency on September 8 in order to protect Virginia residents and to mobilize resources in support of neighboring states.Officials in New Orleans stated that there would not be much time for preparations if Irma failed to make the projected northward turn, but that South Texas or Florida would not be a good evacuation destination.On September 10, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam issued an executive order allowing medical professionals in other states to practice in Tennessee to aid Hurricane Irma evacuees.This order also allowed pharmacies to give out 14-day supplies of medicine, and gave women and children from outside the state the ability to participate in the Tennessee Department of Health programs.Bristol Motor Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway, and Charlotte Motor Speedway all opened their campgrounds to evacuees free of charge.\n\nIn professional sports, the Miami Dolphins–Tampa Bay Buccaneers game scheduled for September 10 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was postponed to November 19 due to the storm\'s threat.The Dolphins left early for their road game against the Los Angeles Chargers.The Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees moved their September 11–13 series from Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg to Citi Field in Queens.Minor League Baseball\'s Florida State League, Carolina League, and Southern League called off their championship finals and as a result, named their division series winners league co-champions.The Miami FC versus San Francisco Deltas match on September 10 was cancelled so the players and staff could prepare for the storm with their families.The Orlando Pride of the National Women\'s Soccer League rescheduled their September 9 match to September 7. Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer did not have any scheduled home games in September, but was unable to return to training facilities in Orlando due to Hurricane Irma.\n\nIn college football, the UCF Knights-Memphis Tigers game scheduled for September 9 was moved to September 30, replacing UCF\'s game against Maine and Memphis game against Georgia State.UCF also cancelled their game against Georgia Tech on September 16, as UCF\'s stadium hosted the National Guard.The USF Bulls-Connecticut Huskies football game was also cancelled.The Miami Hurricanes–Arkansas State Redwolves game scheduled for September 9 at Centennial Bank Stadium in Arkansas was canceled due to travel concerns for the University of Miami.The Florida Gators-Northern Colorado Bears match in Gainesville scheduled for September 9 was cancelled.The Florida State Seminoles contest against the Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks was canceled on September 8.The Seminoles\' rivalry game with the Hurricanes in Tallahassee, originally scheduled for September 16, was postponed tp October 7.The FIU Panthers game against the Alcorn State Braves was moved up a day and relocated to Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.The Georgia Southern Eagles game against the New Hampshire Wildcats on September 9 was also moved to Legion Field for that day.\n\nAs of September 5, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding was running dangerously low, due to its response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas the previous week, prompting the Trump administration to request an immediate $8 billion in additional funding as Irma approached Florida.Given the rate that current funds are being consumed and the catastrophic damage, the United States Senate almost doubled the requested amount to $15.3 billion, with the understanding that this would only be about 10% of what will be required for responding to Harvey.\n\nHurricane Irma\'s path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating, with landfalls in Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Martin, the Bahamas, Cuba, and the United States, all at major hurricane intensity.Furthermore, the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences.Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria.\n\nThe eyewall of the hurricane moved over Barbuda near its record peak intensity early on September 6; a weather station observed a wind gust of .The same station also recorded a minimum barometric pressure of .The exact state of the island remained unclear for hours after Irma\'s passage, as downed phone lines ceased all communication with nearby islands.Later that afternoon, Prime Minister Gaston Browne surveyed the territory by helicopter, revealing an effectively uninhabitable island.Irma damaged or destroyed 95% of the structures on Barbuda, including its hospital, schools, and both of its hotels; it completely flattened some residential blocks while submerging others.The destruction rendered the island\'s sole airport and much of its infrastructure inoperative—including water and telecommunication services—which further hampered relief efforts.Property damage on Barbuda ranged from $150 million to $300 million.A total of three storm-related deaths were reported on the island.\n\nIn addition to the catastrophic impact on Barbuda\'s human residents, concern turned to the storm\'s effects on the island\'s wildlife.The island\'s only endemic bird, the near-threatened Barbuda warbler, numbered less than 2,000 individuals prior to the hurricane.For some time it was unknown if the warbler survived the hurricane or its aftermath; however within a few months it was confirmed that not only did the species survive, but the most of the birds survived the storm.Barbuda\'s Codrington Lagoon, home to the largest colony of magnificent frigatebirds in the Caribbean, with an estimated 2,500 nesting pairs, was also inundated by the storm surge.\n\nRemaining just outside of Irma\'s strongest windfield, Antigua sustained less severe damage, in the form of leveled roofs and fences, downed power poles and lines, and uprooted trees.Some street flooding also took place in low-lying areas.Three people were treated for minor storm-related injuries.Forensic disaster analysts from the Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM), a Germany-based risk management agency, estimate that economic losses for Antigua and Barbuda will exceed $120 million.\n\nOn the morning of September 6, Irma\'s center crossed the island of Saint Martin while the storm was at peak intensity, sweeping away entire structures, submerging roads and cars, and triggering an island-wide blackout.Irma\'s extreme winds ripped trees out of the ground and sent vehicles and debris from damaged structures scattered across the territory.On the French side of Saint-Martin, entire marinas around Marigot were left in ruins, littered with the stranded remnants of boats that had smashed into each other.A hotel caught on fire, but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze.Another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor.Media images depicted devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds had shattered their windows.Irma killed four people on the French side of the island and injured 50 others, one of whom was in critical condition.As many as 95% of the buildings there were damaged to some degree; 60% of those were totally uninhabitable.Estimates from CEDIM indicate a minimum of $950 million worth of economic losses.Total losses exceeded €3.5 billion (US$4.17 billion).\n\nA similar situation unfolded in Sint Maarten, Saint Martin\'s Dutch half, as intense winds ripped through buildings and lifted vehicles aloft ""as if they were matches"".The hurricane wreaked havoc on Princess Juliana International Airport, with ""huge chunks of the building [strewn] across the runway and a jet bridge snapped in half.""It demolished or severely damaged about 70% of Sint Maarten\'s houses, forcing thousands of residents into public shelters.There were 4 deaths and 23 injuries, 11 of which were serious, in the Dutch territory.Irma is considered the worst natural disaster to hit Sint Maarten; the extent of its damage far exceeded that of any previous hurricane.Total damages were estimated at €2.5 billion (US$2.98 billion).\n\nIrma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the French island of Saint Barthélemy, southeast of Saint Martin.Describing the extent of the destruction, one local compared it to ""a bomb that burned all vegetation,"" while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively ""erased the island from the map"".Violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments, with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation.Streets in the capital of Gustavia were turned into rushing rivers, which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture.The island\'s fire station was inundated with up to of flood waters.With scores of homes and much of the infrastructure destroyed, the majority of the island\'s population was left stranded and without water, electricity or phone service.The associated economic losses could exceed $480 million according to CEDIM\'s analysts.\n\nPreliminary assessments from the French government indicate that Hurricane Irma caused a combined €1.2 billion (US$1.43 billion) in insured losses across the French territories of Saint-Martin and Saint Barts.This total covered private property such as homes, vehicles and businesses (including lost revenue); the extent of the damage to infrastructural and public facilities remains undetermined.Nonetheless, this made Irma one of the costliest natural disasters to hit the French Republic in 50 years.\n\nOn January 30, 2018, roughly five months after Irma, an analysis was published indicating that an anemometer on the island recorded an unofficial gust to before failing.\n\nThe British Overseas Territory of Anguilla saw the eyewall of the storm pass over it on September 6.Many homes and schools were destroyed, and the island\'s only hospital was badly damaged.The devastation was particularly severe in East End, where the winds uprooted scores of trees and power poles and demolished a number of houses.In The Valley, the island\'s capital, the hurricane blew out the windows of government buildings.Rough seas inflicted heavy damage upon several bays and harbors, and a seaside restaurant was completely eradicated.About 90% of roads were left impassable.The island\'s air traffic control tower was damaged, exacerbating the already poor communication with the island.One death was reported on the island.Estimates of losses on the island total at least $190 million.\n\nLarge swells ahead of Irma washed ashore debris and sea life in Castries, Saint Lucia, blocking some roads.Seaside roads were inundated with water.One surfer was killed amid rough surf in Barbados after hitting a reef and breaking his neck.Trees were also destroyed.The hurricane\'s effects, such as violent seas and rattling trees, were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in Guadeloupe.Several houses were damaged.Around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm, leaving several communes in the dark without running water.Overall damage was limited to external parts of houses and trees that were blown onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seas.\n\nSaint Kitts and Nevis endured similar conditions to other islands.Blustery rainstorms triggered scattered power outages and disabled the island\'s water system, but per the International Red Cross, the islands were spared the level of destruction seen elsewhere.Still, Prime Minister Timothy Harris stated that property and infrastructure had sustained ""significant damage.""The Dutch territories of Saba and Sint Eustatius were also struck by the hurricane\'s winds, resulting in infrastructural damage, water shortages and telecommunication outages.Several houses were left uninhabitable.On Saba, the hurricane also defoliated trees and injured a few people.CEDIM\'s analysts expect economic losses of $20–65 million for the two islands.\n\nDamage in the British Virgin Islands was extensive.Numerous buildings and roads were destroyed on the island of Tortola, which bore the brunt of the hurricane\'s core.Four people were confirmed dead.Along Cane Garden Bay, the storm surge submerged several seaside bars and a gas station.Satellite images revealed many of the island\'s residential zones had been left in ruins.The hurricane passed over Necker Island, also causing severe damage and destroying the mansion of Richard Branson.\n\nMost homes and businesses were destroyed on the island of Jost Van Dyke, the smallest of the B.V.I.\'s four main islands.The Governor, Gus Jaspert, who had only been sworn into office 13 days previously, declared a state of emergency - the first time this has ever happened in the Territory.After the storm, restoration of electricity took approximately 5 months.\n\nIrma\'s effects in the U.S. Virgin Islands were most profound on Saint Thomas, where at least of rain fell, and on Saint John.Saint Thomas island suffered widespread structural damage, including to its police station and airport.Patients from the fourth and third floors of Charlotte Amalie\'s hospital had to be relocated to lower floors due to flooding from roof leaks.Three deaths were attributed to Irma on the island.On nearby Saint Croix, there were communication issues and some damage to the infrastructure.Saint John lost access to ferry and cargo services, along with access to the local airport.Due to its normal reliance on electricity from Saint Thomas, the island was left without power.Total damage from the three islands was at least $1.1 billion.\n\nThe hurricane passed north of Puerto Rico, but still caused significant damage to the United States territory.Along the coast, a tide gauge observed waves up to mean higher high water.Much of the main island experienced sustained tropical storm force winds, with a peak sustained wind speed of at a weather station along San Juan Bay, while the same site observed a peak wind gust of .However, on the island of Culebra, a wind gust of was reported.Mainly due to strong winds, approximately 1.1 million out of 1.5 million of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority\'s customers lost electricity.Portions of Puerto Rico received heavy rainfall, with a peak total of in Bayamón, causing seven rivers to reach flood stage, widespread flash flooding, and at least six landslides.\n\nThe most severely affected areas included the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques, as well as the northeastern, northern, and mountainous portions of the main island.On Culebra, the island suffered an almost complete loss of electrical and water services.At least 30 homes on the island were destroyed, while about 30 other experienced substantial damage.High winds also toppled a number of trees.The only telecommunications tower on Culebra sustained damage, cutting off outside communications for several hours.In rural Loíza, 79 homes were destroyed.Throughout Puerto Rico, 781 out of 1,600 telecommunications towers went out of commission, primarily due to power outages.At least 362,000 customers lost water services.Debris, mostly fallen trees, blocked at least 72 roads.Approximately 25% to 30% of banana, coffee, papaya, and plantain crops were damaged by strong winds, with losses to farmers estimated at $30.6 million.Approximately 1,530 homes experienced at least moderate damage, with 1,448 homes moderately damaged, 32 extensively damaged, and 50 completely destroyed.\n\nHurricane Irma was attributed to around $1 billion in damage, and the NHC attributed three fatalities to Irma in Puerto Rico, though four deaths were related to the storm.Two people died due to rainstorms ahead of the hurricane: one man died in Orocovis after falling off his ladder while repairing his roof; another man on the coast in Capitanejo died after being struck by lightning.Three nearby fishermen were burned by the same lightning strike, but survived.Two other people died during the hurricane: a woman died while being evacuated from her house in a wheelchair and fell, hitting her head; another person died in a car accident in Canóvanas.Governor Ricardo Rosselló declared the islands of Culebra and Vieques to be disaster areas.\n\nAlthough spared a direct hit, both the Dominican Republic and Haiti were affected by high winds and heavy rains.A bridge over the Dajabón River connecting the two countries was broken.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, the fishing community of Nagua sustained damage from waves that destroyed homes.55,000 soldiers were deployed to affected areas to help with the clean-up efforts.By the evening of September 7, the government had counted 2,721 damaged homes.\n\nIn Haiti, flooding one meter deep sat in residential neighborhoods in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives.Mudslides, destroyed homes, flooded crops, and infrastructure damage were reported in the northern part of the country.The total expanse of the flooding stretched from Môle-Saint-Nicolas in the west to the eastern border with the Dominican Republic.\n\nOn the evening of September 7, at 7:30 pm AST (23:30 UTC), Hurricane Irma reached the Turks and Caicos Islands.While the eye passed just south of the main islands, crossing over South Caicos and the Ambergris Cays, the most powerful winds on the northern side of the eye swept all of the islands for more than two hours.Communications infrastructure was destroyed.\n\nOn September 8, Minister of Infrastructure Goldray Ewing confirmed that damage to Providenciales was extensive, with the northwestern neighborhood of Blue Hill being ""gone"".The hospital in the capital, Cockburn Town, was heavily damaged.On South Caicos, 75% of roofs were lost.Total damage was estimated at over $500 million.\n\nIn the Bahamas, the eye of the storm passed over Duncan Town, the major settlement of the Ragged Islands chain, on September 8.It also passed ""almost directly over"" Inagua and South Acklins, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.\n\nDamages were largely confined to the southern islands starting the morning of September 8.On Mayaguana and Great Inagua, downed power lines knocked out communications.On Great Inagua, 70% of homes sustained roof damage, and the island\'s school lost its roof entirely.The Morton Salt Company\'s signature production facility, one of the major employers in the country, experienced millions of dollars in damages.The Acklins settlement of Salina Point was cut off from the rest of the island by flooding, while Crooked Island had widespread roof damage.In the northern Bahamas, the worst property damage came on September 10 as the outer bands of the system produced tornadic activity on Grand Bahama and Bimini.Damage and losses across The Bahamas amounted to $135 million.\n\nWhile Irma was making landfall in Florida, the ocean was drawn away from some western shorelines of the Bahamas due to strong easterly winds.\n\nEarly on September 9, Irma made landfall on the Camagüey Archipelago off the northern coast of Cuba, with sustained winds of .The strongest official sustained wind speed was , while the highest wind gust reached ; both were observed near Camila in Ciego de Ávila Province.The weather station at Esmeralda, Camagüey, was damaged, with the wind gauge destroyed.The north coast of Cuba experienced significant coastal flooding due to storm surge and abnormally high tides generated by the storm.Wave heights at Cayo Romano exceeded .Storm surge penetrated as far as inland in some areas of Villa Clara Province.Multiple locations on the island observed at least of rainfall, with a peak total of of precipitation at Topes de Collantes.\n\nA total of 158,554 homes experienced some degree of damage, of which 14,657 were destroyed; approximately 1.9 million people experienced the direct effects of Irma.The storm partially deroofed 103,691 homes, while 23,560 were completely deroofed.Irma damaged or destroyed 980 health facilities and 2,264 schools.Approximately 3.1 million people experienced disruptions to the water supply, while 246,707 people lost telephone service.About of roads were damaged.Crops also suffered extensively, with nearly affected by the storm.Throughout the country, the hurricane inflicted $13.185 billion in damage and killed 10 people, making Irma the costliest tropical cyclone in Cuban history.\n\nThe tourist areas of Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and Cayo Santa María and the nearby town of Caibarién received the brunt of the storm, with waves rolling through town and the characteristic one-story homes completely flooded.The storm most severely Ciego de Ávila and Villa Clara provinces.Flooding worsened as the hurricane moved west, pushing the storm surge along to the regions around Havana.By the afternoon, limited flooding was occurring in Havana, including around the Malecón.Portions of province coastal flooding surpassing that which was experienced during the Storm of the Century in 1993 and Hurricane Wilma in 2005.In the city of Santa Clara, 39 buildings collapsed.Rainfall resulted in several rivers reaching major flood stage.The town of Cabaiguán in Sancti Spíritus Province in particular suffered extensive inland flooding after the Zaza River swelled.\n\nHurricane Irma directly affected a major colony of American flamingos on Cuba\'s northern Cayo Coco.Early reports from Diario de Cuba indicated that several hundred flamingos had been killed by the storm, though other estimates ranged as high as several thousand birds.\n\nHurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida.Except for the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned.Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba, but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys.The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States.After surveying the aftermath of Irma, Florida governor Rick Scott said ""I thought we would see more damage""[on the mainland] but said ""he witnessed devastation in the Keys"".President Donald Trump commented on Twitter that the devastation in some places was ""far greater than anyone thought"".\n\nDamage in the United States was estimated at a minimum of $50 billion.At the time, Irma was the fourth costliest tropical cyclone in the United States, behind hurricanes Sandy in 2012, Harvey earlier that year, and Katrina in 2005.However, later in September 2017, Hurricane Maria became the third costliest United States tropical cyclone, causing Irma to fall to the fifth costliest.At least 92 people, 10 directly and 82 indirectly, died throughout the United States in relation to Irma: 84 in Florida, 3 in Georgia, 3 in South Carolina, and 2 in North Carolina.\n\nIrma struck the state less than two weeks after Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten had caused the worst flooding seen in western Florida in 20 years, which further worsened the impacts in the region.The storm\'s large wind field resulted in strong winds across much of Florida, except for the western Panhandle.The highest reported sustained wind speed was on Marco Island, while the strongest observed wind gust was , recorded near Naples, though wind gusts of likely occurred in the Middle Florida Keys.More than 7.7 million homes and businesses in Florida were left without electricity at some point – approximately 73% of state.Generally heavy amounts of rainfall were recorded to the east of the Irma\'s path, including a peak total of in Fort Pierce.Heavy precipitation – and storm surge, in some instances – overflowed at least 32 rivers and creeks, causing significant flooding, particularly along the St. Johns River and its tributaries.Many homes and businesses suffered damage or destruction, with more than 65,000 structures damaged to some degree in West Central and Southwest Florida alone.Agriculture experienced about $2.5 billion in damage.It was estimated that the cyclone caused at least $50 billion in damage, making Irma the costliest hurricane in Florida history, surpassing Hurricane Andrew, until it was itself surpassed by Hurricane Ian, 5 years later.\n\nThroughout Florida, at least 84 people died in storm-related incidents.About half of the deaths occurred from drowning, trauma, and carbon monoxide poisoning.Broward County had 21 fatalities, the most of any county in Florida.Among those deaths were 12 people at The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, a Hollywood nursing home.The patients died from sweltering heat worsened by the lack of air conditioning.The hurricane also left at least 14 deaths in Monroe County; 6 deaths in Orange County; 5 deaths each in Duval, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties; 4 deaths in both Highlands and Hillsborough counties; 3 deaths in both Marion and Polk counties; 2 deaths each in Collier, Hardee, Leon, Pinellas, St. Lucie, and Taylor counties; and 1 death in Hendry, Lake, Lee, Liberty, Manatee, Nassau, Okeechobee, Pasco, Seminole, St. Johns, and Volusia counties.\n\nWith Irma making landfall in Monroe County as a Category 4 hurricane, the Florida Keys were hardest hit area in the state.Strong winds and storm surge flooding caused major damage to buildings, trailer parks, boats, roads, the electricity supply, mobile phone coverage, internet access, sanitation, the water supply and the fuel supply throughout the island chain.An estimated storm surge occurred at Cudjoe Key, where Irma made landfall.Throughout the island, 625 homes sustained minor damage, 52 sustained major damage, and 81 were demolished.On Big Pine Key, one of the most devastated islands, 633 homes received minor impact, 299 homes received major impact, and 473 homes were completely destroyed.Overall in Monroe County, 27,649 homes experienced some degree of damage, including 1,179 homes being destroyed, 2,977 homes receiving major damage, and 5,361 suffering minor damage.\n\nAfter devastating the Keys, the storm then struck Collier County as a Category 3 hurricane.Several communities in the county suffered extensive damage, especially along the coast.Throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, 65 homes, including 44 mobile homes, were demolished, while 1,008 homes received major damage.Property damages in unincorporated areas alone reach about $320 million.Lee County was lashed by strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused prolonged flooding in some areas.More than 24,000 homes suffered some degree of damage, with almost 3,000 homes receiving major damage and 89 homes being destroyed.Damage in the county totaled about $857 million.\n\nImpact in much of the Miami metropolitan area was generally limited to extensive tree and fence damage, as well as widespread power outages.However, in Miami-Dade County, about 1,000 homes received major damage and about 50% of crops were lost.Storm surge caused coastal flooding from Homestead to Downtown Miami, as well as in portions of Miami Beach.Parts of the Florida Heartland were devastated by high winds and flooding, particularly Hendry and Highlands counties.In the former, which has most citrus trees of any county in Florida, about 60% of orange crops were lost.Throughout Hendry County, a total of 451 homes had minor damage, 131 homes suffered major damage, and 42 others were destroyed.In Highlands County, 13,138 businesses and homes were damaged to some degree, with 144 being destroyed, 963 sustaining major damage, and 2,408 receiving minor damage.In Orange County, wind gusts reached 79 mph at Orlando International Airport.A wind gust of 91 mph was also recorded in Orlando at the top of the Disney Contemporary Resort.Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central Florida left some wind damage and flooding, necessitating evacuations and rescues, including more than 200 people in Orlo Vista after hundreds of homes were flooded.A total of 2,999 business or homes were damaged in Lake County, 7,430 in Seminole County, and 3,457 in Volusia County.Additionally, eight tornadoes touched down in Brevard County, all of which caused damage.\n\nAlong much of the Gulf Coast of Florida, to the north of where Irma made landfall, negative storm surges were observed, with water retracting rather than pushing inland, causing little coastal flooding.However, on the opposite coast, extensive erosion and storm surge flooding occurred in the First Coast, especially in Duval and St. Johns counties.In Duval County, the St. Johns River crested at heights that exceeded records set during Hurricane Dora in 1964.Portions of Jacksonville experienced flooding, particularly the downtown area and the Riverside and San Marco neighborhoods, with about 350 people rescued in those sections of the city.Water reached about high in some homes.The city of Jacksonville suffered about $85 million in damage.\n\nIn St. Johns County, storm surge left extensive damage to oceanfront properties in Ponte Vedra Beach and Vilano Beach, with several becoming uninhabitable.Additionally, some riverfront businesses in St. Augustine\'s historic district were flooded due to storm surge from the Matanzas River.In nearby Clay County, rainfall and storm surge combined to cause extensive flooding along portions of the Black Creek and the St. Johns River, with record high crests at several locations along the former.About 350 people and 75 animals were rescued from floodwaters throughout the county.A total of 275 homes were destroyed, 175 were inflicted major damage, and 124 received minor damage.\n\nThree deaths were reported in Georgia due to falling trees and debris, along with widespread wind damage and power outages throughout the state primarily due to fallen trees.On Tybee Island, as well as St. Simons Island the storm surge caused extensive flooding.The tropical storm also did $54 million in damage in the state.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the third highest storm surge on record was recorded, reaching a height of approximately .By of September 12, almost 100,000 had lost power in Upstate South Carolina.Five people died in storm-related incidents across South Carolina, all from indirect incidents.The tropical storm caused damages totaling $500,000 in the state.\n\nLight damage occurred in other areas, including Tennessee.About 75,000 customers in North Carolina lost power due to Irma.It also caused $600,000 in damages in Alabama.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Irma\'s path through the West Indies and Caribbean, the devastation to roads, harbors and airports significantly impeded the transportation and distribution of relief supplies.Foreign countries moved to provide much of the initial aid.The British, Dutch, French, and United States governments sent warships and planes with supplies and manpower to the region.International leaders, including Dutch King Willem-Alexander and French President Emmanuel Macron, quickly moved to visit affected territories.\n\nSome of the affected countries and territories also offered assistance to each other.Cuba, which sustained extensive damage from the storm, sent 750 health workers to Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, Dominica, and Haiti.Government officials and members of the public in Puerto Rico delivered assistance and evacuated people stranded on other islands.The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services granted special 30-day humanitarian visas for British Virgin Islanders to stay in Puerto Rico.Hundreds of people stranded on Saint Martin were flown to the Dominican Republic on humanitarian grounds.\n\nIn response to Hurricane Jose\'s approach, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a mandatory evacuation on September 9 for any remaining residents on Barbuda.A Miami cargo plane landed on Antigua later that day, carrying over 60 tons (120,000 lbs) of relief supplies for the displaced storm victims—including bottled water, canned food and power generators.\n\nRFA Mounts Bay stationed itself near Anguilla and provided support and relief work to the island with its helicopters and 40 marines and army engineers.The ship delivered 6 tonnes of emergency aid to Anguilla and army engineers repaired a fuel leak at Anguilla\'s main petrol dump, restored power to the island\'s hospital and provided shelters for those left homeless by the hurricane.The ship arrived in the British Virgin Islands on September 8, 2017, to provide emergency relief to the islands, including providing shelters, food and water.HMS Ocean was diverted from the Mediterranean to provide relief from Gibraltar to the affected British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos on September 7, and aid was also supplied by the Department for International Development from their disaster response centre at Kemble Airfield.As part of a £32 million operation named Operation Ruman, nearly 500 UK military personnel with emergency relief were dispatched from RAF Brize Norton.This included the first deployment of No. 38 Expeditionary Air Wing with 3 RAF aircraft; 2 Airbus A400M Atlas and 1 C130J hercules to support relief efforts.\n\nThe British government also drafted 2 members of the UK police calibre into the region on September 10, and 53 police officers were drafted from RAF Brize Norton to the affected British Overseas Territories on September 15 to help maintain order.UK politicians, including the chairs of the foreign affairs and development select committees, criticized both the government\'s preparations for the storm and its response as inadequate.\n\nBy September 12, the Department for International Development had delivered more than 40 tonnes of aid into the region, including into Turks and Caicos, and 1,000 UK military troops were deployed in the region as part of relief efforts.The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, pledged an additional £25 million worth of funding as part of relief efforts in the region on September 13, 2017, and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Boris Johnson, said that a further 250 UK military personnel would be deployed into the area within the next few days.Anguilla\'s Chief Minister, Victor Banks, praised the British government\'s response to the storm and said that Boris Johnson\'s visit to the island ""sends a very positive signal to Anguillans that the British are serious about their response to this very severe hurricane"", but went on to say that the current financial commitment from the UK was not substantial enough.\n\nBy September 15, the United Kingdom had over 70 military personnel and 4 police officers in Anguilla and had delivered 15 tonnes of aid to the island.In the British Virgin Islands, Royal Marines had cleared the airfield so that it was operational for the delivery of aid into the islands, with more than 200 British military personnel and 54 UK police officers on the ground and 8 tonnes of aid delivered to the islands.120 British military personnel were on the ground in Turks and Caicos, and over 150 shelter kits and 720 liters of water were delivered to the islands on September 15.\n\nAmendments to international aid rules by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (or OECD) allowed for the UK government to provide access to £13 billion worth of aid to the affected British Overseas Territories, through the UK\'s Official Development Assistance (ODA) by November 2017.\n\nBy the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage.The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by Irma\'s eye, remained largely inaccessible for days.Assessments showed that 15% of the national telecommunications network had been affected, with at least one tower destroyed.Bahamasair resumed a limited domestic schedule on September 10, with international flights still cancelled due to existing and anticipated destruction at other destinations.\n\nThe worst devastation occurred on Ragged Island, over which Irma\'s eye had directly passed.After days of the National Emergency Management Agency not being able to physically reach the island, officials were finally able to inspect it; they promptly declared it uninhabitable.Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said that it was the worst disaster area he or his officials had ever seen, and that all remaining residents would need to leave, potentially permanently.Business leaders and other officials called for a new long-term development model to shift the population away from such sparsely-settled islands.\n\nOn Grand Bahama and Bimini, where tornadoes associated with Irma touched down on September 10, more than 100 people were left displaced.Infrastructure damage included docks, parks, and the power system.\n\nAside from tangible asset losses, Irma brought significant economic damages.International freight shipping was projected to be offline for a week, and costs for rebuilding supplies were inflated due to demand in the U.S.\n\nSwollen rivers contributed to worsening flooding in the days after the storm system left, resulting in additional evacuations.Officials resorted to using inflatable rafts to access affected areas.The national electrical infrastructure was said to be extensively damaged.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, flooding worsened following Irma\'s departure, leading the number of displaced persons to increase to more than 24,000 by September 8.President Danilo Medina ordered further evacuations due to at-risk dams, while the government banned swimming in rivers and ordered boats kept in port.More than 422,000 people were left without water due to 28 aqueducts being damaged.\n\nIn Haiti, officials stated that losses were greater than they could have been since people largely did not heed early preparation and evacuation warnings.At least 5,000 homes were flooded.One man died trying to cross a flooded river; another went missing and 17 were injured.The trash- and waste-contaminated floodwaters in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives led to fears of cholera outbreaks.Flooding continued to worsen days after the storm, as runoff from the mountains swelled rivers in low-lying farming communities.United Nations peacekeepers from Brazil were able to gain access to the flooded northwest region to provide urgent aid, but non-governmental organizations and Haitian economists warned that the estimated 30,000 victims would need longer-term assistance as well.Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant appointed a government commission to address Irma\'s effects, with Action Against Hunger in charge of humanitarian coordination.\n\nIn the USVI, residents and tourists alike were described as being in a state of traumatic shock.By September 7, the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship had arrived in the USVI to provide supplies, damage assessment, and evacuation assistance.Four additional warships, some of which had already been on their way to Texas to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief, were redirected to the region.At a September 10 news conference, Governor Kenneth Mapp described Irma as a ""horrific disaster"" for which ""[t]here will be no restorations or solutions in days or weeks.""The Federal Emergency Management Agency airlifted in goods for residents, who were subjected to a curfew.Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line agreed to transport tourists to Florida, contingent upon port availability following the state\'s own experience with Irma.\n\nOn Saint John, described as ""perhaps the site of Irma\'s worst devastation on American soil,"" it took six days for an active-theater disaster zone to be established, leading to criticism of the U.S. government response.The National Guard was delayed in reaching Saint John due to the number of overturned boats left in the harbor.The National Guard was brought in to maintain order, while the Coast Guard brought evacuees to cruise ships bound for San Juan and Miami.There was still no electricity on St. John in the middle of October 2017.\n\nBy September 9, more than one million Puerto Ricans were still without power, tens of thousands were without water, and several thousand were still in shelters.Hospitals were operating on generator power.The government was struggling to establish contact with the islands of Culebra and Vieques.By September 10, the main island had recovered enough to serve as a refuge for people stranded on other islands, including 1,200 tourists from Saint Martin and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Airlifts had brought more than 50 patients to Puerto Rico.\n\nFive months after Irma, two-thirds of the hospital beds on Saint Thomas were still unavailable, due to extensive physical damage and staffing shortages.\n\nDamage to Sint Maarten\'s harbour and to Princess Juliana International Airport left the Dutch part of Saint Martin unreachable, although the smaller Grand Case-Espérance Airport on the French side could be reopened by September 7 for supply aid by helicopter and airplane.The French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops on board a CASA/IPTN CN-235 aircraft.\n\nThe following day, the Dutch military was able to airlift dialysis patients off the island while also dropping leaflets to warn islanders about the rapidly approaching Hurricane Jose.Although the airport was closed, 435 students and faculty of the American University of the Caribbean were evacuated by the U.S. military.On September 10, Dutch King Willem-Alexander departed for the region, with intentions to visit Sint Maarten and other affected Dutch territories and commonwealth members.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron followed this announcement by stating his intentions to visit the French part of the island on September 12 in order to bring aid supplies.In response to criticism of the French handling of the disaster, 1,000 troops, police, and other emergency workers were sent to Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.\n\nOn both sides of Saint Martin, desperate conditions combined with food and water shortages in Irma\'s aftermath led to reports of violence, scavenging, and theft.In response, the French government increased its troop deployment to 2,200 and the Dutch government sent more than 600 military and police personnel.\n\nThe day after the hurricane hit Saint Barthelemy the French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops into the reopened Grand Case-Espérance Airport.On September 7 and 9, equipment and personnel were flown from France to Guadeloupe and Martinique.\n\nSporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm.\n\nOn September 11, Florida Governor Rick Scott conducted an aerial tour to survey the damage to the Keys.The Overseas Highway remained closed while authorities assessed the integrity of the 42 bridges along the route.Residents returning to the Keys were faced with a police roadblock, to the south of Florida City.USS Iwo Jima, USS New York and aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were sent to the Keys area to aid with the recovery.\n\nOn September 12, some residents were allowed to return into the Keys as far as Islamorada.Although road damage blocked entry any farther than Islamorada, bridges had been inspected and found safe to Sugarloaf Key.By late on September 12, the Overseas Highway had been repaired and the bridges inspected as safe for first responders to travel to Key West.On September 16, residents were free to return to Marathon.Residents were allowed to return to Key West the following day, although the Keys remained closed to tourists and a checkpoint remained in place in Florida City.\n\nDue mainly to the widespread loss of power, cell phone service was also reduced after battery backup power for cell phone towers ran out and backup generators ran out of fuel.In an impact report by the FCC, as of 11 AM EDT on September 12, 89 of 108 (82%) cell phone towers were non-functioning in Monroe County (Florida Keys), 154 of 212 (73%) were non-functioning in Collier County (Naples), 36 of 46 (78%) were non-functioning in Hendry County, and an additional six counties had 41-60% of cell phone towers not functioning, including Lee County (Fort Myers) and Miami-Dade County.\n\nNOAA released map-format aerial reconnaissance image data of damage from the storm.The imagery featured several areas of Florida: including the Florida Keys, the southwest coast of Florida from Marco Island to Punta Gorda, much of the northeast coast of Florida, and portions of the Jacksonville area.Portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts were also photographed.Additionally, the Sun-Sentinel published before and after photos of several landmarks in the Florida Keys.\n\nIn the days after the hurricane, due to the heavy rainfall, numerous rivers had flooded, including residential areas.Public health risks, such as diarrheal infections and mosquito-borne illnesses, remain from the flooding that resulted in the aftermath of the hurricane.A large concern from flooding is contamination because people become exposed to dirty floodwaters and the potential for contaminated water to enter the local water supply is significant.One example of an illness that can enter the water supply is leptospirosis, which is rat urine carries into the floodwaters.Untreated exposure to leptospirosis can cause kidney damage, meningitis, and liver failure.Noroviruses and other infections are also a risk.\n\nFollowing Irma\'s passage, a hand-carved wooden canoe was discovered on the banks of the Indian River and could be several hundred years old.The state has removed the canoe for examination and safe keeping.\n\nDue to Irma\'s and Hurricane Harvey\'s impact in Florida and Texas, U.S. employment declined in September 2017 for the first time since September 2010.The leisure and hospitality industries were especially hard hit, losing 111,000 jobs in September.\n\nIrma set multiple records for intensity, especially at easterly longitudes, time spent at such an intensity, and its intensity at landfall.When Irma reached Category 5 intensity with winds of at 11:45 UTC on September 5 at 57.7°W, it became the easternmost Atlantic hurricane of this strength on record, surpassing Hurricane David of 1979, later beaten by Hurricane Lorenzo 2 years later.By 00:15 UTC on September 6, Irma reached peak intensity with () winds and a minimum pressure of .This ties it with Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and Hurricane Rita of 2005 as the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed.Only five other Atlantic hurricanes have been recorded with wind speeds higher than Irma: Hurricane Allen of 1980, which had maximum sustained winds of , and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Gilbert of 1988, Hurricane Wilma of 2005, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, all of which had peak winds of .At the time, Irma was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; later surpassed by Hurricane Dorian, and was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007.In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category 5 strength winds, and the third-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, with a value of 64.9 units.Only the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane and Hurricane Ivan in 2004 achieved higher values.\n\nOn September 6, Irma made landfall on the islands of Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Virgin Gorda at peak strength.This ties Irma with cyclones Monica of 2006 and Winston of 2016, and typhoons Zeb of 1998 and Megi of 2010 as the seventh-strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall globally – in terms of sustained winds – trailing only Typhoon Goni of 2020 which bore winds of at landfall, Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 and Typhoon Meranti of 2016, which bore winds of at landfall, and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Typhoon Joan of 1959, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, which bore winds of at landfall.Irma is second to the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin, and is the first hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic at Category 5 status since Felix in 2007.Irma is the first recorded Category 5 hurricane to affect the northern Leeward Islands, and was one of the worst storms to hit the region on record, along with Hurricane Donna in 1960 and Hurricane Luis in 1995.In addition, Irma is only the second hurricane on record to make landfall in Cuba at Category 5 intensity, with the other being a hurricane in 1924.Furthermore, when Irma made landfall on Barbuda, Saint Martin, Virgin Gorda, and Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane, it became one of only two recorded Atlantic storms to make landfall in multiple nations at this strength; the other was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which struck both Eleuthera and the United States as a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nIrma made landfall in the Florida Keys with winds of and a pressure of , making it the strongest hurricane to strike Florida in terms of wind speed since Charley in 2004, and the most intense to strike the state in terms of barometric pressure since Andrew in 1992.In the span of two weeks, two Category 4 hurricanes—Harvey and Irma—struck the continental United States, the first time on record two Atlantic tropical cyclones of such strength made landfall on the country in the same hurricane season.This also marked only the third occurrence of two consecutive Atlantic storms making landfall in the United States as major hurricanes.The other two instances were the Great Charleston and Cheniere Caminada hurricanes in 1893, and hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne in 2004.\n\nBecause of the extensive damage and loss of life the hurricane caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Irma from its rotating naming lists in April 2018, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane.It was replaced with Idalia for the 2023

41,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Hurricane Irma', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'Hurricane Irma was an extremely powerful Cape Verde hurricane that caused widespread destruction across its path in early September 2017.Irma was the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the Leeward Islands on record, followed by Maria two weeks later.At the time, it was considered the most powerful hurricane on record in the open Atlantic region, outside of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, until it was surpassed by Hurricane Dorian two years later.It was also the third-strongest Atlantic hurricane at landfall ever recorded, just behind the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane and Dorian.The ninth named storm, fourth hurricane, second major hurricane, and first Category 5 hurricane of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Irma caused widespread and catastrophic damage throughout its long lifetime, particularly in the northeastern Caribbean and the Florida Keys.It was also the most intense hurricane to strike the continental United States since Katrina in 2005, the first major hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Wilma in the same year, and the first Category 4 hurricane to strike the state since Charley in 2004.The word Irmageddon was coined soon after the hurricane to describe the damage caused by the hurricane.\n\nIrma developed from a tropical wave near the Cape Verde Islands on August 30.Favorable conditions allowed Irma to rapidly intensify into a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson wind scale by late on August 31.The storm\'s intensity fluctuated between Categories 2 and 3 for the next several days, due to a series of eyewall replacement cycles.On September 4, Irma resumed intensifying, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by early on the next day.Early on September 6, Irma peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of and a minimum pressure of .Irma was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017 in terms of barometric pressure, and the strongest worldwide in 2017 in terms of wind speed.Another eyewall replacement cycle caused Irma to weaken back to a Category 4 hurricane, but the storm re-attained Category 5 status before making landfall in Cuba.Although Irma briefly weakened to a Category 2 storm while making landfall on Cuba, the system re-intensified to Category 4 status as it crossed the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, before making landfall on Cudjoe Key on September 10.Irma then weakened to Category 3 status, prior to another landfall in Florida on Marco Island later that day.The system degraded into a remnant low over Alabama and ultimately dissipated on September 13 over Missouri.\n\nThe storm caused catastrophic damage in Barbuda, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Anguilla, and the Virgin Islands as a Category 5 hurricane.The hurricane caused at least 134 deaths: one in Anguilla; one in Barbados; three in Barbuda; four in the British Virgin Islands; 10 in Cuba; 11 in the French West Indies; one in Haiti; three in Puerto Rico; four on the Dutch side of Sint Maarten; 92 in the contiguous United States, and four in the U.S. Virgin Islands.Hurricane Irma was the top Google searched term in the U.S. and globally in 2017.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa on August 26.The tropical wave moved off the coast of the continent late on August 27.Throughout the next two days, showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low-pressure area, as the system passed just south of and then through the Cape Verde Islands on August 29.Around 00:00 UTC on the following day, the system developed into a tropical depression just west of the Cape Verde Islands.Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Irma, based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates.With warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, strengthening was anticipated, with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier air.\n\nThe nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow, as an anticyclone became established over the system, with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images.Early on August 31, shortly after the development of a central dense overcast (CDO) and an eye feature, Irma underwent rapid intensification, becoming a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 UTC and then a Category 3 hurricane, becoming a major hurricane – around 00:00 UTC on September 1.Within a 48-hour period, the hurricane\'s intensity had increased by .On September 2, a ship passed to the west of the center of Irma, recording maximum winds of , which indicated that the eye of Irma remained compact.A strong high pressure system to the north of Irma caused the storm to move west-southwestward between September 2 and September 4.The first aircraft reconnaissance mission departed from Barbados on the afternoon of September 3, discovering an eye in diameter and surface winds of .\n\nOn September 4, after moving into more favorable conditions, Irma strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane.As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by 12:00 UTC on the following day, with winds of .The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at near 18:00 UTC on September 5. Irma acquired annular characteristics around this time, with the storm exhibiting a large, symmetric CDO and an impressive satellite appearance.Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern Leeward Islands.Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of Barbuda at peak intensity, with the storm\'s central minimum pressure having bottomed out at – this was the lowest in the Atlantic since Dean in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of .Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15 UTC on Sint Maarten, and at 16:30 UTC on Virgin Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands, though the storm\'s central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall.\n\nAs the hurricane moved away from the Virgin Islands late on September 6, observations from reconnaissance flights, as well as Doppler radar in San Juan, Puerto Rico, indicated an elliptical eye and double eyewalls.Late on September 6, the cyclone passed about north of Puerto Rico.Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of Hispaniola throughout the day on September 7.After beginning an eyewall replacement cycle, Irma weakened to a Category 4 hurricane as it passed south of the Turks and Caicos Islands early on September 8.This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category 5 intensity, the second-longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above – behind only the 1932 Cuba hurricane.At 05:00 UTC on September 8, Irma made landfall on the island of Little Inagua in the Bahamas with sustained winds of .The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a subtropical ridge to its north.Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category 5 intensity at 18:00 UTC that day east of Cuba as deep convection became more pronounced and organized.The hurricane then made landfall in Cayo Romano, Cuba, at 03:00 UTC on September 9, with winds of .This made Irma only the second Category 5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the 1924 Cuba hurricane.As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category 2 storm later on September 9.\n\nAfter slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards Florida around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental United States.Moving over the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, Irma quickly restrengthened to a Category 4 hurricane at 06:00 UTC on September 10, as deep convection improved and the eye became better defined.In addition, Irma\'s wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of and gale-force winds spanning in diameter.The cyclone made landfall in Cudjoe Key, Florida, at 13:00 UTC on September 10, at Category 4 intensity, with winds of .Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category 3 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30 UTC, in Marco Island, Florida, with sustained winds of .Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category 3 intensity hours after landfall.Passing east of Tampa as a weakening Category 1 hurricane around 06:00 UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation – though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds.The system finally weakened to a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC that day as it entered southern Georgia, while acquiring some extratropical characteristics.At 06:00 UTC on September 12, Irma degenerated to a remnant low just as it entered Alabama, as most of the deep convection had diminished.The remnants persisted for another day or so before dissipating over Missouri on September 13.\n\nGiven that Irma\'s forecast track was along much of the Caribbean island chain, hurricane warnings were issued for the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and parts of Hispaniola on September 5.\n\nIn Antigua and Barbuda, residents safeguarded their homes and cleaned up their properties in anticipation of strong winds.Emergency crews were put on standby at public shelters and hospitals by September 5 to assist with any evacuations.Expecting a direct hit, more than half of the residents on Barbuda took shelter, and relief supplies were preemptively mobilized.The National Emergency Management Organization on Saint Lucia urged small craft operators and swimmers to be mindful of forecasts for high surf.Small Craft Warnings and High Surf Advisories were hoisted for Dominica, where residents were urged to remain vigilant of the potential for high waves, landslides, and flooding.\n\nIn Guadeloupe, low-lying and cliff-edge homes were evacuated at the threat of flooding and erosion.Schools and public businesses closed on September 5 and 6.Hospitals stocked up on three days\' worth of supplies and checked the functionality of their generators.Of the island\'s 32 communes, 22 activated their emergency plans; 1,500 people were urged to take shelter.The island sustained relatively minor damage and became the base for relief efforts on Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.Though the core of the hurricane was expected to remain north of the island, a yellow alert was issued for Martinique due to the likelihood of rough seas.The island dispatched relief supplies and military reinforcements to its neighboring islands of Guadeloupe, Saint Martin.and Saint Barthélemy, which faced a greater risk of a direct impact.\n\nOn September 4, Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency.By September 6, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency had deployed response teams in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.Supplies, including food rations, medical supplies, and blankets, were pre-staged in strategic locations on the islands for distribution.\n\nOn September 5, the Dominican Republic activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage; the United States and Haiti followed suit two days later.According to officials, 11,200 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas prior to the storm\'s arrival.Approximately 7,400 tourists were moved to Santo Domingo, away from beach resorts.In Haiti, government officials and aid organizations struggled with early preparation and evacuation efforts.While some officials blamed reluctance and indifference on the part of the population, others ""admitted they were not prepared for the onslaught and no mandatory evacuation orders were in place ahead of Irma\'s approach.""Local officials contended that they had not received promised funds, supplies, or equipment from the national government.The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti prepared its 1,000 peacekeepers and engineers to assist.\n\nIn the Turks and Caicos, evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas starting September 5. Schools were closed, government buildings were boarded up, and shelters were opened.Officials spread warnings to residents in English, Creole, and Spanish via social media, radio, SMS text, and WhatsApp.In The Bahamas, the government began preparations the week prior to the hurricane\'s arrival, including securing national sports facilities to use as shelters.By September 7, the government had evacuated 1,609 people by air from the southern islands, including 365 from Bimini.Controlled cutting of the power supply to southern and central Bahamian islands was conducted in advance of the storm.Shelters were made available, though usage was low due to most evacuees staying with family on other islands.Of the 2,679 foreign tourists still in The Bahamas on September 7, about 1,200 were being housed at Atlantis Paradise Island, one of the most hurricane-ready structures in the country.\n\nIn Cuba, meteorologists did not initially predict a direct hit.Fuel conservation was enacted in Camagüey Province to ensure that enough would be available during post-storm power outages.The Civil Defense evacuated nearly one million people from low-lying areas, including thousands of Canadian and European tourists in the Jardines del Rey.Dolphins at a Cayo Guillermo resort were evacuated by helicopter.\n\nThe NHC issued several watches and warnings for the Southeastern United States.The first watches and warnings were issued at 15:00 UTC on September 7, which was a hurricane watch from the Jupiter Inlet to Bonita Beach, including the Florida Keys and Lake Okeechobee.The watches and warnings were extended into Georgia and South Carolina on September 9.At 21:00 UTC on that day, the advisories reached their maximum extent, with a hurricane warning covering the entire east coast of the state, the west coast from Indian Pass southward, and the Florida Keys; a hurricane watch was in place from the Florida–Georgia state line to Edisto Beach, South Carolina; and there were two tropical storm warnings, one in Florida from Indian Pass to the Okaloosa–Walton county line and the other from the Florida–Georgia state line to the South Santee River in South Carolina.Watches and warnings were gradually discontinued as Irma moved inland and weakened, with all of them canceled by early on September 12.\n\nOn September 4, Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency.Governor Scott placed 100 members of the Florida National Guard on duty to assist in preparations.All 7,000 troops were ordered to be on duty by September 8.Officials advised residents to stock their hurricane kits.The state coordinated with electrical companies in order for power outages to be restored as quickly as possible, extending resources such as equipment, fuel, and lodging for the approximately 24,000 restoration personnel who had been activated.Governor Scott suspended tolls on all toll roads in Florida, including the turnpike.All state offices in Florida were closed from September 8 to September 11, while public schools, state colleges, and state universities in all 67 counties were closed during the same period.The Florida Department of Education coordinated with school districts as the need for transportation by school buses and opening shelters arose.By September 9, more than 150 state parks were closed.Throughout the state, almost 700 emergency shelters were opened.The shelters collectively housed about 191,764 people, with more than 40% of them staying in a shelter in South Florida.Additionally, more than 60 special needs shelters were opened, which housed more than 5,000 people by September 9.\n\nMany airports across the state, particularly in Central and South Florida, were closed.Nearly 9,000 flights intending to arrive in or depart from Florida were canceled.Along Florida\'s coasts, most seaports were closed or opened with restricted access.For the fifth time in its 45-year history, the Walt Disney World Resort was completely closed due to the storm.Its theme parks, water parks, and Disney Springs were all closed by 9:00 p.m. on September 9 and remained closed until September 12.Other Orlando-area theme parks, including Universal Orlando Resort and SeaWorld Orlando, were also closed.The Kennedy Space Center was closed from September 8 to September 15.\n\nAn estimated 6.5 million Floridians were ordered to evacuate, mostly those living on barrier islands or in coastal areas; in mobile or sub-standard homes; and in low-lying or flood prone areas.Mandatory evacuations were ordered for portions of Brevard, Broward, Citrus, Collier, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Glades, Hendry, Hernando, Indian River, Lee, Martin, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Lucie, Sumter, and Volusia counties.All of Monroe County, where the Florida Keys are located, was placed under a mandatory evacuation.Residents in communities near the southern half of Lake Okeechobee were also ordered to leave.Additionally, voluntary evacuation notices were issued for all or parts of Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Charlotte, Columbia, Desoto, Hardee, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lake, Manatee, Okeechobee, Osceola, and Polk counties.\n\nA record 6.5 million Floridians evacuated, making it the largest evacuation in the state\'s history.Evacuees caused significant traffic congestion on northbound Interstate 95, Interstate 75, and Florida\'s Turnpike, exacerbated by the fact that the entire Florida peninsula was within the cone of uncertainty in the NHC\'s forecast path in the days before the storm, so evacuees from both coasts headed north, as evacuees would not be safer by fleeing to the opposite coast.Fuel was in short supply throughout peninsular Florida during the week before Irma\'s arrival, especially along evacuation routes, leading to hours-long lines at fuel stations and even escorts of fuel trucks by the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nUse of the left shoulder as a lane for moving traffic was allowed on northbound Interstate 75 from Wildwood to the Georgia state line beginning September 8 and on eastbound Interstate 4 from Tampa to State Road 429 near Celebration for a few hours on September 9.It was the first time that the shoulder-use plan, which was introduced at the start of the 2017 hurricane season, was implemented by the state for hurricane evacuations.The shoulder-use plan was implemented in place of labor- and resource-intensive contraflow lane reversal, in which both sides of an interstate highway are used for one direction of traffic.\n\nOfficials from the Environmental Protection Agency, which had been criticized for its response to Hurricane Harvey, took special measures to inspect and secure hazardous materials, especially at Superfund sites.Direct Relief, a disaster relief organization, coordinated with local health centers and provided resources to help facilities on the front lines of Floridian and Puerto Rican communities.\n\nGeorgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency initially for all six coastal counties on September 6, but eventually expanded the declaration to 94 counties south of Atlanta metropolitan area, and then the entire state on September 10.Atlanta was placed under its first-ever tropical storm warning.Governor Deal ordered mandatory evacuations for all areas east of Interstate 95 on September 7, before extending the order to the entirety of Chatham County and low-lying areas west of I-95 on the following day.In total, 540,000 people on the Georgia coast were ordered to leave.Contraflow lane reversal for Interstate 16 took effect on the morning of September 9 from Savannah to Dublin, Georgia.All Georgia state parks were open for free to evacuees, as was the 800-acre camping area at Atlanta Motor Speedway.Reversible HOT lanes on Interstate 75 in Georgia through south metro Atlanta were open 24 hours northbound with no tolls.\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on September 6, with South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster following suit the same day.Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency on September 8 in order to protect Virginia residents and to mobilize resources in support of neighboring states.Officials in New Orleans stated that there would not be much time for preparations if Irma failed to make the projected northward turn, but that South Texas or Florida would not be a good evacuation destination.On September 10, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam issued an executive order allowing medical professionals in other states to practice in Tennessee to aid Hurricane Irma evacuees.This order also allowed pharmacies to give out 14-day supplies of medicine, and gave women and children from outside the state the ability to participate in the Tennessee Department of Health programs.Bristol Motor Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway, and Charlotte Motor Speedway all opened their campgrounds to evacuees free of charge.\n\nIn professional sports, the Miami Dolphins–Tampa Bay Buccaneers game scheduled for September 10 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was postponed to November 19 due to the storm\'s threat.The Dolphins left early for their road game against the Los Angeles Chargers.The Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees moved their September 11–13 series from Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg to Citi Field in Queens.Minor League Baseball\'s Florida State League, Carolina League, and Southern League called off their championship finals and as a result, named their division series winners league co-champions.The Miami FC versus San Francisco Deltas match on September 10 was cancelled so the players and staff could prepare for the storm with their families.The Orlando Pride of the National Women\'s Soccer League rescheduled their September 9 match to September 7. Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer did not have any scheduled home games in September, but was unable to return to training facilities in Orlando due to Hurricane Irma.\n\nIn college football, the UCF Knights-Memphis Tigers game scheduled for September 9 was moved to September 30, replacing UCF\'s game against Maine and Memphis game against Georgia State.UCF also cancelled their game against Georgia Tech on September 16, as UCF\'s stadium hosted the National Guard.The USF Bulls-Connecticut Huskies football game was also cancelled.The Miami Hurricanes–Arkansas State Redwolves game scheduled for September 9 at Centennial Bank Stadium in Arkansas was canceled due to travel concerns for the University of Miami.The Florida Gators-Northern Colorado Bears match in Gainesville scheduled for September 9 was cancelled.The Florida State Seminoles contest against the Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks was canceled on September 8.The Seminoles\' rivalry game with the Hurricanes in Tallahassee, originally scheduled for September 16, was postponed tp October 7.The FIU Panthers game against the Alcorn State Braves was moved up a day and relocated to Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.The Georgia Southern Eagles game against the New Hampshire Wildcats on September 9 was also moved to Legion Field for that day.\n\nAs of September 5, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding was running dangerously low, due to its response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas the previous week, prompting the Trump administration to request an immediate $8 billion in additional funding as Irma approached Florida.Given the rate that current funds are being consumed and the catastrophic damage, the United States Senate almost doubled the requested amount to $15.3 billion, with the understanding that this would only be about 10% of what will be required for responding to Harvey.\n\nHurricane Irma\'s path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating, with landfalls in Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Martin, the Bahamas, Cuba, and the United States, all at major hurricane intensity.Furthermore, the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences.Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria.\n\nThe eyewall of the hurricane moved over Barbuda near its record peak intensity early on September 6; a weather station observed a wind gust of .The same station also recorded a minimum barometric pressure of .The exact state of the island remained unclear for hours after Irma\'s passage, as downed phone lines ceased all communication with nearby islands.Later that afternoon, Prime Minister Gaston Browne surveyed the territory by helicopter, revealing an effectively uninhabitable island.Irma damaged or destroyed 95% of the structures on Barbuda, including its hospital, schools, and both of its hotels; it completely flattened some residential blocks while submerging others.The destruction rendered the island\'s sole airport and much of its infrastructure inoperative—including water and telecommunication services—which further hampered relief efforts.Property damage on Barbuda ranged from $150 million to $300 million.A total of three storm-related deaths were reported on the island.\n\nIn addition to the catastrophic impact on Barbuda\'s human residents, concern turned to the storm\'s effects on the island\'s wildlife.The island\'s only endemic bird, the near-threatened Barbuda warbler, numbered less than 2,000 individuals prior to the hurricane.For some time it was unknown if the warbler survived the hurricane or its aftermath; however within a few months it was confirmed that not only did the species survive, but the most of the birds survived the storm.Barbuda\'s Codrington Lagoon, home to the largest colony of magnificent frigatebirds in the Caribbean, with an estimated 2,500 nesting pairs, was also inundated by the storm surge.\n\nRemaining just outside of Irma\'s strongest windfield, Antigua sustained less severe damage, in the form of leveled roofs and fences, downed power poles and lines, and uprooted trees.Some street flooding also took place in low-lying areas.Three people were treated for minor storm-related injuries.Forensic disaster analysts from the Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM), a Germany-based risk management agency, estimate that economic losses for Antigua and Barbuda will exceed $120 million.\n\nOn the morning of September 6, Irma\'s center crossed the island of Saint Martin while the storm was at peak intensity, sweeping away entire structures, submerging roads and cars, and triggering an island-wide blackout.Irma\'s extreme winds ripped trees out of the ground and sent vehicles and debris from damaged structures scattered across the territory.On the French side of Saint-Martin, entire marinas around Marigot were left in ruins, littered with the stranded remnants of boats that had smashed into each other.A hotel caught on fire, but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze.Another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor.Media images depicted devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds had shattered their windows.Irma killed four people on the French side of the island and injured 50 others, one of whom was in critical condition.As many as 95% of the buildings there were damaged to some degree; 60% of those were totally uninhabitable.Estimates from CEDIM indicate a minimum of $950 million worth of economic losses.Total losses exceeded €3.5 billion (US$4.17 billion).\n\nA similar situation unfolded in Sint Maarten, Saint Martin\'s Dutch half, as intense winds ripped through buildings and lifted vehicles aloft ""as if they were matches"".The hurricane wreaked havoc on Princess Juliana International Airport, with ""huge chunks of the building [strewn] across the runway and a jet bridge snapped in half.""It demolished or severely damaged about 70% of Sint Maarten\'s houses, forcing thousands of residents into public shelters.There were 4 deaths and 23 injuries, 11 of which were serious, in the Dutch territory.Irma is considered the worst natural disaster to hit Sint Maarten; the extent of its damage far exceeded that of any previous hurricane.Total damages were estimated at €2.5 billion (US$2.98 billion).\n\nIrma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the French island of Saint Barthélemy, southeast of Saint Martin.Describing the extent of the destruction, one local compared it to ""a bomb that burned all vegetation,"" while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively ""erased the island from the map"".Violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments, with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation.Streets in the capital of Gustavia were turned into rushing rivers, which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture.The island\'s fire station was inundated with up to of flood waters.With scores of homes and much of the infrastructure destroyed, the majority of the island\'s population was left stranded and without water, electricity or phone service.The associated economic losses could exceed $480 million according to CEDIM\'s analysts.\n\nPreliminary assessments from the French government indicate that Hurricane Irma caused a combined €1.2 billion (US$1.43 billion) in insured losses across the French territories of Saint-Martin and Saint Barts.This total covered private property such as homes, vehicles and businesses (including lost revenue); the extent of the damage to infrastructural and public facilities remains undetermined.Nonetheless, this made Irma one of the costliest natural disasters to hit the French Republic in 50 years.\n\nOn January 30, 2018, roughly five months after Irma, an analysis was published indicating that an anemometer on the island recorded an unofficial gust to before failing.\n\nThe British Overseas Territory of Anguilla saw the eyewall of the storm pass over it on September 6.Many homes and schools were destroyed, and the island\'s only hospital was badly damaged.The devastation was particularly severe in East End, where the winds uprooted scores of trees and power poles and demolished a number of houses.In The Valley, the island\'s capital, the hurricane blew out the windows of government buildings.Rough seas inflicted heavy damage upon several bays and harbors, and a seaside restaurant was completely eradicated.About 90% of roads were left impassable.The island\'s air traffic control tower was damaged, exacerbating the already poor communication with the island.One death was reported on the island.Estimates of losses on the island total at least $190 million.\n\nLarge swells ahead of Irma washed ashore debris and sea life in Castries, Saint Lucia, blocking some roads.Seaside roads were inundated with water.One surfer was killed amid rough surf in Barbados after hitting a reef and breaking his neck.Trees were also destroyed.The hurricane\'s effects, such as violent seas and rattling trees, were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in Guadeloupe.Several houses were damaged.Around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm, leaving several communes in the dark without running water.Overall damage was limited to external parts of houses and trees that were blown onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seas.\n\nSaint Kitts and Nevis endured similar conditions to other islands.Blustery rainstorms triggered scattered power outages and disabled the island\'s water system, but per the International Red Cross, the islands were spared the level of destruction seen elsewhere.Still, Prime Minister Timothy Harris stated that property and infrastructure had sustained ""significant damage.""The Dutch territories of Saba and Sint Eustatius were also struck by the hurricane\'s winds, resulting in infrastructural damage, water shortages and telecommunication outages.Several houses were left uninhabitable.On Saba, the hurricane also defoliated trees and injured a few people.CEDIM\'s analysts expect economic losses of $20–65 million for the two islands.\n\nDamage in the British Virgin Islands was extensive.Numerous buildings and roads were destroyed on the island of Tortola, which bore the brunt of the hurricane\'s core.Four people were confirmed dead.Along Cane Garden Bay, the storm surge submerged several seaside bars and a gas station.Satellite images revealed many of the island\'s residential zones had been left in ruins.The hurricane passed over Necker Island, also causing severe damage and destroying the mansion of Richard Branson.\n\nMost homes and businesses were destroyed on the island of Jost Van Dyke, the smallest of the B.V.I.\'s four main islands.The Governor, Gus Jaspert, who had only been sworn into office 13 days previously, declared a state of emergency - the first time this has ever happened in the Territory.After the storm, restoration of electricity took approximately 5 months.\n\nIrma\'s effects in the U.S. Virgin Islands were most profound on Saint Thomas, where at least of rain fell, and on Saint John.Saint Thomas island suffered widespread structural damage, including to its police station and airport.Patients from the fourth and third floors of Charlotte Amalie\'s hospital had to be relocated to lower floors due to flooding from roof leaks.Three deaths were attributed to Irma on the island.On nearby Saint Croix, there were communication issues and some damage to the infrastructure.Saint John lost access to ferry and cargo services, along with access to the local airport.Due to its normal reliance on electricity from Saint Thomas, the island was left without power.Total damage from the three islands was at least $1.1 billion.\n\nThe hurricane passed north of Puerto Rico, but still caused significant damage to the United States territory.Along the coast, a tide gauge observed waves up to mean higher high water.Much of the main island experienced sustained tropical storm force winds, with a peak sustained wind speed of at a weather station along San Juan Bay, while the same site observed a peak wind gust of .However, on the island of Culebra, a wind gust of was reported.Mainly due to strong winds, approximately 1.1 million out of 1.5 million of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority\'s customers lost electricity.Portions of Puerto Rico received heavy rainfall, with a peak total of in Bayamón, causing seven rivers to reach flood stage, widespread flash flooding, and at least six landslides.\n\nThe most severely affected areas included the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques, as well as the northeastern, northern, and mountainous portions of the main island.On Culebra, the island suffered an almost complete loss of electrical and water services.At least 30 homes on the island were destroyed, while about 30 other experienced substantial damage.High winds also toppled a number of trees.The only telecommunications tower on Culebra sustained damage, cutting off outside communications for several hours.In rural Loíza, 79 homes were destroyed.Throughout Puerto Rico, 781 out of 1,600 telecommunications towers went out of commission, primarily due to power outages.At least 362,000 customers lost water services.Debris, mostly fallen trees, blocked at least 72 roads.Approximately 25% to 30% of banana, coffee, papaya, and plantain crops were damaged by strong winds, with losses to farmers estimated at $30.6 million.Approximately 1,530 homes experienced at least moderate damage, with 1,448 homes moderately damaged, 32 extensively damaged, and 50 completely destroyed.\n\nHurricane Irma was attributed to around $1 billion in damage, and the NHC attributed three fatalities to Irma in Puerto Rico, though four deaths were related to the storm.Two people died due to rainstorms ahead of the hurricane: one man died in Orocovis after falling off his ladder while repairing his roof; another man on the coast in Capitanejo died after being struck by lightning.Three nearby fishermen were burned by the same lightning strike, but survived.Two other people died during the hurricane: a woman died while being evacuated from her house in a wheelchair and fell, hitting her head; another person died in a car accident in Canóvanas.Governor Ricardo Rosselló declared the islands of Culebra and Vieques to be disaster areas.\n\nAlthough spared a direct hit, both the Dominican Republic and Haiti were affected by high winds and heavy rains.A bridge over the Dajabón River connecting the two countries was broken.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, the fishing community of Nagua sustained damage from waves that destroyed homes.55,000 soldiers were deployed to affected areas to help with the clean-up efforts.By the evening of September 7, the government had counted 2,721 damaged homes.\n\nIn Haiti, flooding one meter deep sat in residential neighborhoods in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives.Mudslides, destroyed homes, flooded crops, and infrastructure damage were reported in the northern part of the country.The total expanse of the flooding stretched from Môle-Saint-Nicolas in the west to the eastern border with the Dominican Republic.\n\nOn the evening of September 7, at 7:30 pm AST (23:30 UTC), Hurricane Irma reached the Turks and Caicos Islands.While the eye passed just south of the main islands, crossing over South Caicos and the Ambergris Cays, the most powerful winds on the northern side of the eye swept all of the islands for more than two hours.Communications infrastructure was destroyed.\n\nOn September 8, Minister of Infrastructure Goldray Ewing confirmed that damage to Providenciales was extensive, with the northwestern neighborhood of Blue Hill being ""gone"".The hospital in the capital, Cockburn Town, was heavily damaged.On South Caicos, 75% of roofs were lost.Total damage was estimated at over $500 million.\n\nIn the Bahamas, the eye of the storm passed over Duncan Town, the major settlement of the Ragged Islands chain, on September 8.It also passed ""almost directly over"" Inagua and South Acklins, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.\n\nDamages were largely confined to the southern islands starting the morning of September 8.On Mayaguana and Great Inagua, downed power lines knocked out communications.On Great Inagua, 70% of homes sustained roof damage, and the island\'s school lost its roof entirely.The Morton Salt Company\'s signature production facility, one of the major employers in the country, experienced millions of dollars in damages.The Acklins settlement of Salina Point was cut off from the rest of the island by flooding, while Crooked Island had widespread roof damage.In the northern Bahamas, the worst property damage came on September 10 as the outer bands of the system produced tornadic activity on Grand Bahama and Bimini.Damage and losses across The Bahamas amounted to $135 million.\n\nWhile Irma was making landfall in Florida, the ocean was drawn away from some western shorelines of the Bahamas due to strong easterly winds.\n\nEarly on September 9, Irma made landfall on the Camagüey Archipelago off the northern coast of Cuba, with sustained winds of .The strongest official sustained wind speed was , while the highest wind gust reached ; both were observed near Camila in Ciego de Ávila Province.The weather station at Esmeralda, Camagüey, was damaged, with the wind gauge destroyed.The north coast of Cuba experienced significant coastal flooding due to storm surge and abnormally high tides generated by the storm.Wave heights at Cayo Romano exceeded .Storm surge penetrated as far as inland in some areas of Villa Clara Province.Multiple locations on the island observed at least of rainfall, with a peak total of of precipitation at Topes de Collantes.\n\nA total of 158,554 homes experienced some degree of damage, of which 14,657 were destroyed; approximately 1.9 million people experienced the direct effects of Irma.The storm partially deroofed 103,691 homes, while 23,560 were completely deroofed.Irma damaged or destroyed 980 health facilities and 2,264 schools.Approximately 3.1 million people experienced disruptions to the water supply, while 246,707 people lost telephone service.About of roads were damaged.Crops also suffered extensively, with nearly affected by the storm.Throughout the country, the hurricane inflicted $13.185 billion in damage and killed 10 people, making Irma the costliest tropical cyclone in Cuban history.\n\nThe tourist areas of Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and Cayo Santa María and the nearby town of Caibarién received the brunt of the storm, with waves rolling through town and the characteristic one-story homes completely flooded.The storm most severely Ciego de Ávila and Villa Clara provinces.Flooding worsened as the hurricane moved west, pushing the storm surge along to the regions around Havana.By the afternoon, limited flooding was occurring in Havana, including around the Malecón.Portions of province coastal flooding surpassing that which was experienced during the Storm of the Century in 1993 and Hurricane Wilma in 2005.In the city of Santa Clara, 39 buildings collapsed.Rainfall resulted in several rivers reaching major flood stage.The town of Cabaiguán in Sancti Spíritus Province in particular suffered extensive inland flooding after the Zaza River swelled.\n\nHurricane Irma directly affected a major colony of American flamingos on Cuba\'s northern Cayo Coco.Early reports from Diario de Cuba indicated that several hundred flamingos had been killed by the storm, though other estimates ranged as high as several thousand birds.\n\nHurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida.Except for the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned.Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba, but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys.The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States.After surveying the aftermath of Irma, Florida governor Rick Scott said ""I thought we would see more damage""[on the mainland] but said ""he witnessed devastation in the Keys"".President Donald Trump commented on Twitter that the devastation in some places was ""far greater than anyone thought"".\n\nDamage in the United States was estimated at a minimum of $50 billion.At the time, Irma was the fourth costliest tropical cyclone in the United States, behind hurricanes Sandy in 2012, Harvey earlier that year, and Katrina in 2005.However, later in September 2017, Hurricane Maria became the third costliest United States tropical cyclone, causing Irma to fall to the fifth costliest.At least 92 people, 10 directly and 82 indirectly, died throughout the United States in relation to Irma: 84 in Florida, 3 in Georgia, 3 in South Carolina, and 2 in North Carolina.\n\nIrma struck the state less than two weeks after Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten had caused the worst flooding seen in western Florida in 20 years, which further worsened the impacts in the region.The storm\'s large wind field resulted in strong winds across much of Florida, except for the western Panhandle.The highest reported sustained wind speed was on Marco Island, while the strongest observed wind gust was , recorded near Naples, though wind gusts of likely occurred in the Middle Florida Keys.More than 7.7 million homes and businesses in Florida were left without electricity at some point – approximately 73% of state.Generally heavy amounts of rainfall were recorded to the east of the Irma\'s path, including a peak total of in Fort Pierce.Heavy precipitation – and storm surge, in some instances – overflowed at least 32 rivers and creeks, causing significant flooding, particularly along the St. Johns River and its tributaries.Many homes and businesses suffered damage or destruction, with more than 65,000 structures damaged to some degree in West Central and Southwest Florida alone.Agriculture experienced about $2.5 billion in damage.It was estimated that the cyclone caused at least $50 billion in damage, making Irma the costliest hurricane in Florida history, surpassing Hurricane Andrew, until it was itself surpassed by Hurricane Ian, 5 years later.\n\nThroughout Florida, at least 84 people died in storm-related incidents.About half of the deaths occurred from drowning, trauma, and carbon monoxide poisoning.Broward County had 21 fatalities, the most of any county in Florida.Among those deaths were 12 people at The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, a Hollywood nursing home.The patients died from sweltering heat worsened by the lack of air conditioning.The hurricane also left at least 14 deaths in Monroe County; 6 deaths in Orange County; 5 deaths each in Duval, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties; 4 deaths in both Highlands and Hillsborough counties; 3 deaths in both Marion and Polk counties; 2 deaths each in Collier, Hardee, Leon, Pinellas, St. Lucie, and Taylor counties; and 1 death in Hendry, Lake, Lee, Liberty, Manatee, Nassau, Okeechobee, Pasco, Seminole, St. Johns, and Volusia counties.\n\nWith Irma making landfall in Monroe County as a Category 4 hurricane, the Florida Keys were hardest hit area in the state.Strong winds and storm surge flooding caused major damage to buildings, trailer parks, boats, roads, the electricity supply, mobile phone coverage, internet access, sanitation, the water supply and the fuel supply throughout the island chain.An estimated storm surge occurred at Cudjoe Key, where Irma made landfall.Throughout the island, 625 homes sustained minor damage, 52 sustained major damage, and 81 were demolished.On Big Pine Key, one of the most devastated islands, 633 homes received minor impact, 299 homes received major impact, and 473 homes were completely destroyed.Overall in Monroe County, 27,649 homes experienced some degree of damage, including 1,179 homes being destroyed, 2,977 homes receiving major damage, and 5,361 suffering minor damage.\n\nAfter devastating the Keys, the storm then struck Collier County as a Category 3 hurricane.Several communities in the county suffered extensive damage, especially along the coast.Throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, 65 homes, including 44 mobile homes, were demolished, while 1,008 homes received major damage.Property damages in unincorporated areas alone reach about $320 million.Lee County was lashed by strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused prolonged flooding in some areas.More than 24,000 homes suffered some degree of damage, with almost 3,000 homes receiving major damage and 89 homes being destroyed.Damage in the county totaled about $857 million.\n\nImpact in much of the Miami metropolitan area was generally limited to extensive tree and fence damage, as well as widespread power outages.However, in Miami-Dade County, about 1,000 homes received major damage and about 50% of crops were lost.Storm surge caused coastal flooding from Homestead to Downtown Miami, as well as in portions of Miami Beach.Parts of the Florida Heartland were devastated by high winds and flooding, particularly Hendry and Highlands counties.In the former, which has most citrus trees of any county in Florida, about 60% of orange crops were lost.Throughout Hendry County, a total of 451 homes had minor damage, 131 homes suffered major damage, and 42 others were destroyed.In Highlands County, 13,138 businesses and homes were damaged to some degree, with 144 being destroyed, 963 sustaining major damage, and 2,408 receiving minor damage.In Orange County, wind gusts reached 79 mph at Orlando International Airport.A wind gust of 91 mph was also recorded in Orlando at the top of the Disney Contemporary Resort.Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central Florida left some wind damage and flooding, necessitating evacuations and rescues, including more than 200 people in Orlo Vista after hundreds of homes were flooded.A total of 2,999 business or homes were damaged in Lake County, 7,430 in Seminole County, and 3,457 in Volusia County.Additionally, eight tornadoes touched down in Brevard County, all of which caused damage.\n\nAlong much of the Gulf Coast of Florida, to the north of where Irma made landfall, negative storm surges were observed, with water retracting rather than pushing inland, causing little coastal flooding.However, on the opposite coast, extensive erosion and storm surge flooding occurred in the First Coast, especially in Duval and St. Johns counties.In Duval County, the St. Johns River crested at heights that exceeded records set during Hurricane Dora in 1964.Portions of Jacksonville experienced flooding, particularly the downtown area and the Riverside and San Marco neighborhoods, with about 350 people rescued in those sections of the city.Water reached about high in some homes.The city of Jacksonville suffered about $85 million in damage.\n\nIn St. Johns County, storm surge left extensive damage to oceanfront properties in Ponte Vedra Beach and Vilano Beach, with several becoming uninhabitable.Additionally, some riverfront businesses in St. Augustine\'s historic district were flooded due to storm surge from the Matanzas River.In nearby Clay County, rainfall and storm surge combined to cause extensive flooding along portions of the Black Creek and the St. Johns River, with record high crests at several locations along the former.About 350 people and 75 animals were rescued from floodwaters throughout the county.A total of 275 homes were destroyed, 175 were inflicted major damage, and 124 received minor damage.\n\nThree deaths were reported in Georgia due to falling trees and debris, along with widespread wind damage and power outages throughout the state primarily due to fallen trees.On Tybee Island, as well as St. Simons Island the storm surge caused extensive flooding.The tropical storm also did $54 million in damage in the state.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the third highest storm surge on record was recorded, reaching a height of approximately .By of September 12, almost 100,000 had lost power in Upstate South Carolina.Five people died in storm-related incidents across South Carolina, all from indirect incidents.The tropical storm caused damages totaling $500,000 in the state.\n\nLight damage occurred in other areas, including Tennessee.About 75,000 customers in North Carolina lost power due to Irma.It also caused $600,000 in damages in Alabama.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Irma\'s path through the West Indies and Caribbean, the devastation to roads, harbors and airports significantly impeded the transportation and distribution of relief supplies.Foreign countries moved to provide much of the initial aid.The British, Dutch, French, and United States governments sent warships and planes with supplies and manpower to the region.International leaders, including Dutch King Willem-Alexander and French President Emmanuel Macron, quickly moved to visit affected territories.\n\nSome of the affected countries and territories also offered assistance to each other.Cuba, which sustained extensive damage from the storm, sent 750 health workers to Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, Dominica, and Haiti.Government officials and members of the public in Puerto Rico delivered assistance and evacuated people stranded on other islands.The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services granted special 30-day humanitarian visas for British Virgin Islanders to stay in Puerto Rico.Hundreds of people stranded on Saint Martin were flown to the Dominican Republic on humanitarian grounds.\n\nIn response to Hurricane Jose\'s approach, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a mandatory evacuation on September 9 for any remaining residents on Barbuda.A Miami cargo plane landed on Antigua later that day, carrying over 60 tons (120,000 lbs) of relief supplies for the displaced storm victims—including bottled water, canned food and power generators.\n\nRFA Mounts Bay stationed itself near Anguilla and provided support and relief work to the island with its helicopters and 40 marines and army engineers.The ship delivered 6 tonnes of emergency aid to Anguilla and army engineers repaired a fuel leak at Anguilla\'s main petrol dump, restored power to the island\'s hospital and provided shelters for those left homeless by the hurricane.The ship arrived in the British Virgin Islands on September 8, 2017, to provide emergency relief to the islands, including providing shelters, food and water.HMS Ocean was diverted from the Mediterranean to provide relief from Gibraltar to the affected British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos on September 7, and aid was also supplied by the Department for International Development from their disaster response centre at Kemble Airfield.As part of a £32 million operation named Operation Ruman, nearly 500 UK military personnel with emergency relief were dispatched from RAF Brize Norton.This included the first deployment of No. 38 Expeditionary Air Wing with 3 RAF aircraft; 2 Airbus A400M Atlas and 1 C130J hercules to support relief efforts.\n\nThe British government also drafted 2 members of the UK police calibre into the region on September 10, and 53 police officers were drafted from RAF Brize Norton to the affected British Overseas Territories on September 15 to help maintain order.UK politicians, including the chairs of the foreign affairs and development select committees, criticized both the government\'s preparations for the storm and its response as inadequate.\n\nBy September 12, the Department for International Development had delivered more than 40 tonnes of aid into the region, including into Turks and Caicos, and 1,000 UK military troops were deployed in the region as part of relief efforts.The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, pledged an additional £25 million worth of funding as part of relief efforts in the region on September 13, 2017, and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Boris Johnson, said that a further 250 UK military personnel would be deployed into the area within the next few days.Anguilla\'s Chief Minister, Victor Banks, praised the British government\'s response to the storm and said that Boris Johnson\'s visit to the island ""sends a very positive signal to Anguillans that the British are serious about their response to this very severe hurricane"", but went on to say that the current financial commitment from the UK was not substantial enough.\n\nBy September 15, the United Kingdom had over 70 military personnel and 4 police officers in Anguilla and had delivered 15 tonnes of aid to the island.In the British Virgin Islands, Royal Marines had cleared the airfield so that it was operational for the delivery of aid into the islands, with more than 200 British military personnel and 54 UK police officers on the ground and 8 tonnes of aid delivered to the islands.120 British military personnel were on the ground in Turks and Caicos, and over 150 shelter kits and 720 liters of water were delivered to the islands on September 15.\n\nAmendments to international aid rules by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (or OECD) allowed for the UK government to provide access to £13 billion worth of aid to the affected British Overseas Territories, through the UK\'s Official Development Assistance (ODA) by November 2017.\n\nBy the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage.The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by Irma\'s eye, remained largely inaccessible for days.Assessments showed that 15% of the national telecommunications network had been affected, with at least one tower destroyed.Bahamasair resumed a limited domestic schedule on September 10, with international flights still cancelled due to existing and anticipated destruction at other destinations.\n\nThe worst devastation occurred on Ragged Island, over which Irma\'s eye had directly passed.After days of the National Emergency Management Agency not being able to physically reach the island, officials were finally able to inspect it; they promptly declared it uninhabitable.Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said that it was the worst disaster area he or his officials had ever seen, and that all remaining residents would need to leave, potentially permanently.Business leaders and other officials called for a new long-term development model to shift the population away from such sparsely-settled islands.\n\nOn Grand Bahama and Bimini, where tornadoes associated with Irma touched down on September 10, more than 100 people were left displaced.Infrastructure damage included docks, parks, and the power system.\n\nAside from tangible asset losses, Irma brought significant economic damages.International freight shipping was projected to be offline for a week, and costs for rebuilding supplies were inflated due to demand in the U.S.\n\nSwollen rivers contributed to worsening flooding in the days after the storm system left, resulting in additional evacuations.Officials resorted to using inflatable rafts to access affected areas.The national electrical infrastructure was said to be extensively damaged.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, flooding worsened following Irma\'s departure, leading the number of displaced persons to increase to more than 24,000 by September 8.President Danilo Medina ordered further evacuations due to at-risk dams, while the government banned swimming in rivers and ordered boats kept in port.More than 422,000 people were left without water due to 28 aqueducts being damaged.\n\nIn Haiti, officials stated that losses were greater than they could have been since people largely did not heed early preparation and evacuation warnings.At least 5,000 homes were flooded.One man died trying to cross a flooded river; another went missing and 17 were injured.The trash- and waste-contaminated floodwaters in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives led to fears of cholera outbreaks.Flooding continued to worsen days after the storm, as runoff from the mountains swelled rivers in low-lying farming communities.United Nations peacekeepers from Brazil were able to gain access to the flooded northwest region to provide urgent aid, but non-governmental organizations and Haitian economists warned that the estimated 30,000 victims would need longer-term assistance as well.Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant appointed a government commission to address Irma\'s effects, with Action Against Hunger in charge of humanitarian coordination.\n\nIn the USVI, residents and tourists alike were described as being in a state of traumatic shock.By September 7, the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship had arrived in the USVI to provide supplies, damage assessment, and evacuation assistance.Four additional warships, some of which had already been on their way to Texas to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief, were redirected to the region.At a September 10 news conference, Governor Kenneth Mapp described Irma as a ""horrific disaster"" for which ""[t]here will be no restorations or solutions in days or weeks.""The Federal Emergency Management Agency airlifted in goods for residents, who were subjected to a curfew.Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line agreed to transport tourists to Florida, contingent upon port availability following the state\'s own experience with Irma.\n\nOn Saint John, described as ""perhaps the site of Irma\'s worst devastation on American soil,"" it took six days for an active-theater disaster zone to be established, leading to criticism of the U.S. government response.The National Guard was delayed in reaching Saint John due to the number of overturned boats left in the harbor.The National Guard was brought in to maintain order, while the Coast Guard brought evacuees to cruise ships bound for San Juan and Miami.There was still no electricity on St. John in the middle of October 2017.\n\nBy September 9, more than one million Puerto Ricans were still without power, tens of thousands were without water, and several thousand were still in shelters.Hospitals were operating on generator power.The government was struggling to establish contact with the islands of Culebra and Vieques.By September 10, the main island had recovered enough to serve as a refuge for people stranded on other islands, including 1,200 tourists from Saint Martin and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Airlifts had brought more than 50 patients to Puerto Rico.\n\nFive months after Irma, two-thirds of the hospital beds on Saint Thomas were still unavailable, due to extensive physical damage and staffing shortages.\n\nDamage to Sint Maarten\'s harbour and to Princess Juliana International Airport left the Dutch part of Saint Martin unreachable, although the smaller Grand Case-Espérance Airport on the French side could be reopened by September 7 for supply aid by helicopter and airplane.The French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops on board a CASA/IPTN CN-235 aircraft.\n\nThe following day, the Dutch military was able to airlift dialysis patients off the island while also dropping leaflets to warn islanders about the rapidly approaching Hurricane Jose.Although the airport was closed, 435 students and faculty of the American University of the Caribbean were evacuated by the U.S. military.On September 10, Dutch King Willem-Alexander departed for the region, with intentions to visit Sint Maarten and other affected Dutch territories and commonwealth members.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron followed this announcement by stating his intentions to visit the French part of the island on September 12 in order to bring aid supplies.In response to criticism of the French handling of the disaster, 1,000 troops, police, and other emergency workers were sent to Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.\n\nOn both sides of Saint Martin, desperate conditions combined with food and water shortages in Irma\'s aftermath led to reports of violence, scavenging, and theft.In response, the French government increased its troop deployment to 2,200 and the Dutch government sent more than 600 military and police personnel.\n\nThe day after the hurricane hit Saint Barthelemy the French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops into the reopened Grand Case-Espérance Airport.On September 7 and 9, equipment and personnel were flown from France to Guadeloupe and Martinique.\n\nSporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm.\n\nOn September 11, Florida Governor Rick Scott conducted an aerial tour to survey the damage to the Keys.The Overseas Highway remained closed while authorities assessed the integrity of the 42 bridges along the route.Residents returning to the Keys were faced with a police roadblock, to the south of Florida City.USS Iwo Jima, USS New York and aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were sent to the Keys area to aid with the recovery.\n\nOn September 12, some residents were allowed to return into the Keys as far as Islamorada.Although road damage blocked entry any farther than Islamorada, bridges had been inspected and found safe to Sugarloaf Key.By late on September 12, the Overseas Highway had been repaired and the bridges inspected as safe for first responders to travel to Key West.On September 16, residents were free to return to Marathon.Residents were allowed to return to Key West the following day, although the Keys remained closed to tourists and a checkpoint remained in place in Florida City.\n\nDue mainly to the widespread loss of power, cell phone service was also reduced after battery backup power for cell phone towers ran out and backup generators ran out of fuel.In an impact report by the FCC, as of 11 AM EDT on September 12, 89 of 108 (82%) cell phone towers were non-functioning in Monroe County (Florida Keys), 154 of 212 (73%) were non-functioning in Collier County (Naples), 36 of 46 (78%) were non-functioning in Hendry County, and an additional six counties had 41-60% of cell phone towers not functioning, including Lee County (Fort Myers) and Miami-Dade County.\n\nNOAA released map-format aerial reconnaissance image data of damage from the storm.The imagery featured several areas of Florida: including the Florida Keys, the southwest coast of Florida from Marco Island to Punta Gorda, much of the northeast coast of Florida, and portions of the Jacksonville area.Portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts were also photographed.Additionally, the Sun-Sentinel published before and after photos of several landmarks in the Florida Keys.\n\nIn the days after the hurricane, due to the heavy rainfall, numerous rivers had flooded, including residential areas.Public health risks, such as diarrheal infections and mosquito-borne illnesses, remain from the flooding that resulted in the aftermath of the hurricane.A large concern from flooding is contamination because people become exposed to dirty floodwaters and the potential for contaminated water to enter the local water supply is significant.One example of an illness that can enter the water supply is leptospirosis, which is rat urine carries into the floodwaters.Untreated exposure to leptospirosis can cause kidney damage, meningitis, and liver failure.Noroviruses and other infections are also a risk.\n\nFollowing Irma\'s passage, a hand-carved wooden canoe was discovered on the banks of the Indian River and could be several hundred years old.The state has removed the canoe for examination and safe keeping.\n\nDue to Irma\'s and Hurricane Harvey\'s impact in Florida and Texas, U.S. employment declined in September 2017 for the first time since September 2010.The leisure and hospitality industries were especially hard hit, losing 111,000 jobs in September.\n\nIrma set multiple records for intensity, especially at easterly longitudes, time spent at such an intensity, and its intensity at landfall.When Irma reached Category 5 intensity with winds of at 11:45 UTC on September 5 at 57.7°W, it became the easternmost Atlantic hurricane of this strength on record, surpassing Hurricane David of 1979, later beaten by Hurricane Lorenzo 2 years later.By 00:15 UTC on September 6, Irma reached peak intensity with () winds and a minimum pressure of .This ties it with Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and Hurricane Rita of 2005 as the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed.Only five other Atlantic hurricanes have been recorded with wind speeds higher than Irma: Hurricane Allen of 1980, which had maximum sustained winds of , and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Gilbert of 1988, Hurricane Wilma of 2005, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, all of which had peak winds of .At the time, Irma was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; later surpassed by Hurricane Dorian, and was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007.In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category 5 strength winds, and the third-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, with a value of 64.9 units.Only the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane and Hurricane Ivan in 2004 achieved higher values.\n\nOn September 6, Irma made landfall on the islands of Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Virgin Gorda at peak strength.This ties Irma with cyclones Monica of 2006 and Winston of 2016, and typhoons Zeb of 1998 and Megi of 2010 as the seventh-strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall globally – in terms of sustained winds – trailing only Typhoon Goni of 2020 which bore winds of at landfall, Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 and Typhoon Meranti of 2016, which bore winds of at landfall, and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Typhoon Joan of 1959, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, which bore winds of at landfall.Irma is second to the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin, and is the first hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic at Category 5 status since Felix in 2007.Irma is the first recorded Category 5 hurricane to affect the northern Leeward Islands, and was one of the worst storms to hit the region on record, along with Hurricane Donna in 1960 and Hurricane Luis in 1995.In addition, Irma is only the second hurricane on record to make landfall in Cuba at Category 5 intensity, with the other being a hurricane in 1924.Furthermore, when Irma made landfall on Barbuda, Saint Martin, Virgin Gorda, and Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane, it became one of only two recorded Atlantic storms to make landfall in multiple nations at this strength; the other was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which struck both Eleuthera and the United States as a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nIrma made landfall in the Florida Keys with winds of and a pressure of , making it the strongest hurricane to strike Florida in terms of wind speed since Charley in 2004, and the most intense to strike the state in terms of barometric pressure since Andrew in 1992.In the span of two weeks, two Category 4 hurricanes—Harvey and Irma—struck the continental United States, the first time on record two Atlantic tropical cyclones of such strength made landfall on the country in the same hurricane season.This also marked only the third occurrence of two consecutive Atlantic storms making landfall in the United States as major hurricanes.The other two instances were the Great Charleston and Cheniere Caminada hurricanes in 1893, and hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne in 2004.\n\nBecause of the extensive damage and loss of life the hurricane caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Irma from its rotating naming lists in April 2018, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane.It was replaced with Idalia for the 2023 season.\n\nWeather of 2017 Tropical cyclones in 2017 List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes Operation RUMAN – UK military-civil disaster relief response to Hurricane Irma.List of Cuba hurricanes List

42,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Hurricane Irma', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'Hurricane Irma was an extremely powerful Cape Verde hurricane that caused widespread destruction across its path in early September 2017.Irma was the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the Leeward Islands on record, followed by Maria two weeks later.At the time, it was considered the most powerful hurricane on record in the open Atlantic region, outside of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, until it was surpassed by Hurricane Dorian two years later.It was also the third-strongest Atlantic hurricane at landfall ever recorded, just behind the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane and Dorian.The ninth named storm, fourth hurricane, second major hurricane, and first Category 5 hurricane of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Irma caused widespread and catastrophic damage throughout its long lifetime, particularly in the northeastern Caribbean and the Florida Keys.It was also the most intense hurricane to strike the continental United States since Katrina in 2005, the first major hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Wilma in the same year, and the first Category 4 hurricane to strike the state since Charley in 2004.The word Irmageddon was coined soon after the hurricane to describe the damage caused by the hurricane.\n\nIrma developed from a tropical wave near the Cape Verde Islands on August 30.Favorable conditions allowed Irma to rapidly intensify into a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson wind scale by late on August 31.The storm\'s intensity fluctuated between Categories 2 and 3 for the next several days, due to a series of eyewall replacement cycles.On September 4, Irma resumed intensifying, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by early on the next day.Early on September 6, Irma peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of and a minimum pressure of .Irma was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017 in terms of barometric pressure, and the strongest worldwide in 2017 in terms of wind speed.Another eyewall replacement cycle caused Irma to weaken back to a Category 4 hurricane, but the storm re-attained Category 5 status before making landfall in Cuba.Although Irma briefly weakened to a Category 2 storm while making landfall on Cuba, the system re-intensified to Category 4 status as it crossed the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, before making landfall on Cudjoe Key on September 10.Irma then weakened to Category 3 status, prior to another landfall in Florida on Marco Island later that day.The system degraded into a remnant low over Alabama and ultimately dissipated on September 13 over Missouri.\n\nThe storm caused catastrophic damage in Barbuda, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Anguilla, and the Virgin Islands as a Category 5 hurricane.The hurricane caused at least 134 deaths: one in Anguilla; one in Barbados; three in Barbuda; four in the British Virgin Islands; 10 in Cuba; 11 in the French West Indies; one in Haiti; three in Puerto Rico; four on the Dutch side of Sint Maarten; 92 in the contiguous United States, and four in the U.S. Virgin Islands.Hurricane Irma was the top Google searched term in the U.S. and globally in 2017.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa on August 26.The tropical wave moved off the coast of the continent late on August 27.Throughout the next two days, showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low-pressure area, as the system passed just south of and then through the Cape Verde Islands on August 29.Around 00:00 UTC on the following day, the system developed into a tropical depression just west of the Cape Verde Islands.Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Irma, based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates.With warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, strengthening was anticipated, with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier air.\n\nThe nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow, as an anticyclone became established over the system, with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images.Early on August 31, shortly after the development of a central dense overcast (CDO) and an eye feature, Irma underwent rapid intensification, becoming a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 UTC and then a Category 3 hurricane, becoming a major hurricane – around 00:00 UTC on September 1.Within a 48-hour period, the hurricane\'s intensity had increased by .On September 2, a ship passed to the west of the center of Irma, recording maximum winds of , which indicated that the eye of Irma remained compact.A strong high pressure system to the north of Irma caused the storm to move west-southwestward between September 2 and September 4.The first aircraft reconnaissance mission departed from Barbados on the afternoon of September 3, discovering an eye in diameter and surface winds of .\n\nOn September 4, after moving into more favorable conditions, Irma strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane.As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by 12:00 UTC on the following day, with winds of .The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at near 18:00 UTC on September 5. Irma acquired annular characteristics around this time, with the storm exhibiting a large, symmetric CDO and an impressive satellite appearance.Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern Leeward Islands.Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of Barbuda at peak intensity, with the storm\'s central minimum pressure having bottomed out at – this was the lowest in the Atlantic since Dean in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of .Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15 UTC on Sint Maarten, and at 16:30 UTC on Virgin Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands, though the storm\'s central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall.\n\nAs the hurricane moved away from the Virgin Islands late on September 6, observations from reconnaissance flights, as well as Doppler radar in San Juan, Puerto Rico, indicated an elliptical eye and double eyewalls.Late on September 6, the cyclone passed about north of Puerto Rico.Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of Hispaniola throughout the day on September 7.After beginning an eyewall replacement cycle, Irma weakened to a Category 4 hurricane as it passed south of the Turks and Caicos Islands early on September 8.This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category 5 intensity, the second-longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above – behind only the 1932 Cuba hurricane.At 05:00 UTC on September 8, Irma made landfall on the island of Little Inagua in the Bahamas with sustained winds of .The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a subtropical ridge to its north.Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category 5 intensity at 18:00 UTC that day east of Cuba as deep convection became more pronounced and organized.The hurricane then made landfall in Cayo Romano, Cuba, at 03:00 UTC on September 9, with winds of .This made Irma only the second Category 5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the 1924 Cuba hurricane.As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category 2 storm later on September 9.\n\nAfter slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards Florida around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental United States.Moving over the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, Irma quickly restrengthened to a Category 4 hurricane at 06:00 UTC on September 10, as deep convection improved and the eye became better defined.In addition, Irma\'s wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of and gale-force winds spanning in diameter.The cyclone made landfall in Cudjoe Key, Florida, at 13:00 UTC on September 10, at Category 4 intensity, with winds of .Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category 3 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30 UTC, in Marco Island, Florida, with sustained winds of .Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category 3 intensity hours after landfall.Passing east of Tampa as a weakening Category 1 hurricane around 06:00 UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation – though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds.The system finally weakened to a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC that day as it entered southern Georgia, while acquiring some extratropical characteristics.At 06:00 UTC on September 12, Irma degenerated to a remnant low just as it entered Alabama, as most of the deep convection had diminished.The remnants persisted for another day or so before dissipating over Missouri on September 13.\n\nGiven that Irma\'s forecast track was along much of the Caribbean island chain, hurricane warnings were issued for the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and parts of Hispaniola on September 5.\n\nIn Antigua and Barbuda, residents safeguarded their homes and cleaned up their properties in anticipation of strong winds.Emergency crews were put on standby at public shelters and hospitals by September 5 to assist with any evacuations.Expecting a direct hit, more than half of the residents on Barbuda took shelter, and relief supplies were preemptively mobilized.The National Emergency Management Organization on Saint Lucia urged small craft operators and swimmers to be mindful of forecasts for high surf.Small Craft Warnings and High Surf Advisories were hoisted for Dominica, where residents were urged to remain vigilant of the potential for high waves, landslides, and flooding.\n\nIn Guadeloupe, low-lying and cliff-edge homes were evacuated at the threat of flooding and erosion.Schools and public businesses closed on September 5 and 6.Hospitals stocked up on three days\' worth of supplies and checked the functionality of their generators.Of the island\'s 32 communes, 22 activated their emergency plans; 1,500 people were urged to take shelter.The island sustained relatively minor damage and became the base for relief efforts on Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.Though the core of the hurricane was expected to remain north of the island, a yellow alert was issued for Martinique due to the likelihood of rough seas.The island dispatched relief supplies and military reinforcements to its neighboring islands of Guadeloupe, Saint Martin.and Saint Barthélemy, which faced a greater risk of a direct impact.\n\nOn September 4, Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency.By September 6, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency had deployed response teams in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.Supplies, including food rations, medical supplies, and blankets, were pre-staged in strategic locations on the islands for distribution.\n\nOn September 5, the Dominican Republic activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage; the United States and Haiti followed suit two days later.According to officials, 11,200 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas prior to the storm\'s arrival.Approximately 7,400 tourists were moved to Santo Domingo, away from beach resorts.In Haiti, government officials and aid organizations struggled with early preparation and evacuation efforts.While some officials blamed reluctance and indifference on the part of the population, others ""admitted they were not prepared for the onslaught and no mandatory evacuation orders were in place ahead of Irma\'s approach.""Local officials contended that they had not received promised funds, supplies, or equipment from the national government.The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti prepared its 1,000 peacekeepers and engineers to assist.\n\nIn the Turks and Caicos, evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas starting September 5. Schools were closed, government buildings were boarded up, and shelters were opened.Officials spread warnings to residents in English, Creole, and Spanish via social media, radio, SMS text, and WhatsApp.In The Bahamas, the government began preparations the week prior to the hurricane\'s arrival, including securing national sports facilities to use as shelters.By September 7, the government had evacuated 1,609 people by air from the southern islands, including 365 from Bimini.Controlled cutting of the power supply to southern and central Bahamian islands was conducted in advance of the storm.Shelters were made available, though usage was low due to most evacuees staying with family on other islands.Of the 2,679 foreign tourists still in The Bahamas on September 7, about 1,200 were being housed at Atlantis Paradise Island, one of the most hurricane-ready structures in the country.\n\nIn Cuba, meteorologists did not initially predict a direct hit.Fuel conservation was enacted in Camagüey Province to ensure that enough would be available during post-storm power outages.The Civil Defense evacuated nearly one million people from low-lying areas, including thousands of Canadian and European tourists in the Jardines del Rey.Dolphins at a Cayo Guillermo resort were evacuated by helicopter.\n\nThe NHC issued several watches and warnings for the Southeastern United States.The first watches and warnings were issued at 15:00 UTC on September 7, which was a hurricane watch from the Jupiter Inlet to Bonita Beach, including the Florida Keys and Lake Okeechobee.The watches and warnings were extended into Georgia and South Carolina on September 9.At 21:00 UTC on that day, the advisories reached their maximum extent, with a hurricane warning covering the entire east coast of the state, the west coast from Indian Pass southward, and the Florida Keys; a hurricane watch was in place from the Florida–Georgia state line to Edisto Beach, South Carolina; and there were two tropical storm warnings, one in Florida from Indian Pass to the Okaloosa–Walton county line and the other from the Florida–Georgia state line to the South Santee River in South Carolina.Watches and warnings were gradually discontinued as Irma moved inland and weakened, with all of them canceled by early on September 12.\n\nOn September 4, Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency.Governor Scott placed 100 members of the Florida National Guard on duty to assist in preparations.All 7,000 troops were ordered to be on duty by September 8.Officials advised residents to stock their hurricane kits.The state coordinated with electrical companies in order for power outages to be restored as quickly as possible, extending resources such as equipment, fuel, and lodging for the approximately 24,000 restoration personnel who had been activated.Governor Scott suspended tolls on all toll roads in Florida, including the turnpike.All state offices in Florida were closed from September 8 to September 11, while public schools, state colleges, and state universities in all 67 counties were closed during the same period.The Florida Department of Education coordinated with school districts as the need for transportation by school buses and opening shelters arose.By September 9, more than 150 state parks were closed.Throughout the state, almost 700 emergency shelters were opened.The shelters collectively housed about 191,764 people, with more than 40% of them staying in a shelter in South Florida.Additionally, more than 60 special needs shelters were opened, which housed more than 5,000 people by September 9.\n\nMany airports across the state, particularly in Central and South Florida, were closed.Nearly 9,000 flights intending to arrive in or depart from Florida were canceled.Along Florida\'s coasts, most seaports were closed or opened with restricted access.For the fifth time in its 45-year history, the Walt Disney World Resort was completely closed due to the storm.Its theme parks, water parks, and Disney Springs were all closed by 9:00 p.m. on September 9 and remained closed until September 12.Other Orlando-area theme parks, including Universal Orlando Resort and SeaWorld Orlando, were also closed.The Kennedy Space Center was closed from September 8 to September 15.\n\nAn estimated 6.5 million Floridians were ordered to evacuate, mostly those living on barrier islands or in coastal areas; in mobile or sub-standard homes; and in low-lying or flood prone areas.Mandatory evacuations were ordered for portions of Brevard, Broward, Citrus, Collier, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Glades, Hendry, Hernando, Indian River, Lee, Martin, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Lucie, Sumter, and Volusia counties.All of Monroe County, where the Florida Keys are located, was placed under a mandatory evacuation.Residents in communities near the southern half of Lake Okeechobee were also ordered to leave.Additionally, voluntary evacuation notices were issued for all or parts of Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Charlotte, Columbia, Desoto, Hardee, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lake, Manatee, Okeechobee, Osceola, and Polk counties.\n\nA record 6.5 million Floridians evacuated, making it the largest evacuation in the state\'s history.Evacuees caused significant traffic congestion on northbound Interstate 95, Interstate 75, and Florida\'s Turnpike, exacerbated by the fact that the entire Florida peninsula was within the cone of uncertainty in the NHC\'s forecast path in the days before the storm, so evacuees from both coasts headed north, as evacuees would not be safer by fleeing to the opposite coast.Fuel was in short supply throughout peninsular Florida during the week before Irma\'s arrival, especially along evacuation routes, leading to hours-long lines at fuel stations and even escorts of fuel trucks by the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nUse of the left shoulder as a lane for moving traffic was allowed on northbound Interstate 75 from Wildwood to the Georgia state line beginning September 8 and on eastbound Interstate 4 from Tampa to State Road 429 near Celebration for a few hours on September 9.It was the first time that the shoulder-use plan, which was introduced at the start of the 2017 hurricane season, was implemented by the state for hurricane evacuations.The shoulder-use plan was implemented in place of labor- and resource-intensive contraflow lane reversal, in which both sides of an interstate highway are used for one direction of traffic.\n\nOfficials from the Environmental Protection Agency, which had been criticized for its response to Hurricane Harvey, took special measures to inspect and secure hazardous materials, especially at Superfund sites.Direct Relief, a disaster relief organization, coordinated with local health centers and provided resources to help facilities on the front lines of Floridian and Puerto Rican communities.\n\nGeorgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency initially for all six coastal counties on September 6, but eventually expanded the declaration to 94 counties south of Atlanta metropolitan area, and then the entire state on September 10.Atlanta was placed under its first-ever tropical storm warning.Governor Deal ordered mandatory evacuations for all areas east of Interstate 95 on September 7, before extending the order to the entirety of Chatham County and low-lying areas west of I-95 on the following day.In total, 540,000 people on the Georgia coast were ordered to leave.Contraflow lane reversal for Interstate 16 took effect on the morning of September 9 from Savannah to Dublin, Georgia.All Georgia state parks were open for free to evacuees, as was the 800-acre camping area at Atlanta Motor Speedway.Reversible HOT lanes on Interstate 75 in Georgia through south metro Atlanta were open 24 hours northbound with no tolls.\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on September 6, with South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster following suit the same day.Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency on September 8 in order to protect Virginia residents and to mobilize resources in support of neighboring states.Officials in New Orleans stated that there would not be much time for preparations if Irma failed to make the projected northward turn, but that South Texas or Florida would not be a good evacuation destination.On September 10, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam issued an executive order allowing medical professionals in other states to practice in Tennessee to aid Hurricane Irma evacuees.This order also allowed pharmacies to give out 14-day supplies of medicine, and gave women and children from outside the state the ability to participate in the Tennessee Department of Health programs.Bristol Motor Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway, and Charlotte Motor Speedway all opened their campgrounds to evacuees free of charge.\n\nIn professional sports, the Miami Dolphins–Tampa Bay Buccaneers game scheduled for September 10 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was postponed to November 19 due to the storm\'s threat.The Dolphins left early for their road game against the Los Angeles Chargers.The Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees moved their September 11–13 series from Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg to Citi Field in Queens.Minor League Baseball\'s Florida State League, Carolina League, and Southern League called off their championship finals and as a result, named their division series winners league co-champions.The Miami FC versus San Francisco Deltas match on September 10 was cancelled so the players and staff could prepare for the storm with their families.The Orlando Pride of the National Women\'s Soccer League rescheduled their September 9 match to September 7. Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer did not have any scheduled home games in September, but was unable to return to training facilities in Orlando due to Hurricane Irma.\n\nIn college football, the UCF Knights-Memphis Tigers game scheduled for September 9 was moved to September 30, replacing UCF\'s game against Maine and Memphis game against Georgia State.UCF also cancelled their game against Georgia Tech on September 16, as UCF\'s stadium hosted the National Guard.The USF Bulls-Connecticut Huskies football game was also cancelled.The Miami Hurricanes–Arkansas State Redwolves game scheduled for September 9 at Centennial Bank Stadium in Arkansas was canceled due to travel concerns for the University of Miami.The Florida Gators-Northern Colorado Bears match in Gainesville scheduled for September 9 was cancelled.The Florida State Seminoles contest against the Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks was canceled on September 8.The Seminoles\' rivalry game with the Hurricanes in Tallahassee, originally scheduled for September 16, was postponed tp October 7.The FIU Panthers game against the Alcorn State Braves was moved up a day and relocated to Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.The Georgia Southern Eagles game against the New Hampshire Wildcats on September 9 was also moved to Legion Field for that day.\n\nAs of September 5, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding was running dangerously low, due to its response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas the previous week, prompting the Trump administration to request an immediate $8 billion in additional funding as Irma approached Florida.Given the rate that current funds are being consumed and the catastrophic damage, the United States Senate almost doubled the requested amount to $15.3 billion, with the understanding that this would only be about 10% of what will be required for responding to Harvey.\n\nHurricane Irma\'s path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating, with landfalls in Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Martin, the Bahamas, Cuba, and the United States, all at major hurricane intensity.Furthermore, the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences.Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria.\n\nThe eyewall of the hurricane moved over Barbuda near its record peak intensity early on September 6; a weather station observed a wind gust of .The same station also recorded a minimum barometric pressure of .The exact state of the island remained unclear for hours after Irma\'s passage, as downed phone lines ceased all communication with nearby islands.Later that afternoon, Prime Minister Gaston Browne surveyed the territory by helicopter, revealing an effectively uninhabitable island.Irma damaged or destroyed 95% of the structures on Barbuda, including its hospital, schools, and both of its hotels; it completely flattened some residential blocks while submerging others.The destruction rendered the island\'s sole airport and much of its infrastructure inoperative—including water and telecommunication services—which further hampered relief efforts.Property damage on Barbuda ranged from $150 million to $300 million.A total of three storm-related deaths were reported on the island.\n\nIn addition to the catastrophic impact on Barbuda\'s human residents, concern turned to the storm\'s effects on the island\'s wildlife.The island\'s only endemic bird, the near-threatened Barbuda warbler, numbered less than 2,000 individuals prior to the hurricane.For some time it was unknown if the warbler survived the hurricane or its aftermath; however within a few months it was confirmed that not only did the species survive, but the most of the birds survived the storm.Barbuda\'s Codrington Lagoon, home to the largest colony of magnificent frigatebirds in the Caribbean, with an estimated 2,500 nesting pairs, was also inundated by the storm surge.\n\nRemaining just outside of Irma\'s strongest windfield, Antigua sustained less severe damage, in the form of leveled roofs and fences, downed power poles and lines, and uprooted trees.Some street flooding also took place in low-lying areas.Three people were treated for minor storm-related injuries.Forensic disaster analysts from the Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM), a Germany-based risk management agency, estimate that economic losses for Antigua and Barbuda will exceed $120 million.\n\nOn the morning of September 6, Irma\'s center crossed the island of Saint Martin while the storm was at peak intensity, sweeping away entire structures, submerging roads and cars, and triggering an island-wide blackout.Irma\'s extreme winds ripped trees out of the ground and sent vehicles and debris from damaged structures scattered across the territory.On the French side of Saint-Martin, entire marinas around Marigot were left in ruins, littered with the stranded remnants of boats that had smashed into each other.A hotel caught on fire, but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze.Another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor.Media images depicted devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds had shattered their windows.Irma killed four people on the French side of the island and injured 50 others, one of whom was in critical condition.As many as 95% of the buildings there were damaged to some degree; 60% of those were totally uninhabitable.Estimates from CEDIM indicate a minimum of $950 million worth of economic losses.Total losses exceeded €3.5 billion (US$4.17 billion).\n\nA similar situation unfolded in Sint Maarten, Saint Martin\'s Dutch half, as intense winds ripped through buildings and lifted vehicles aloft ""as if they were matches"".The hurricane wreaked havoc on Princess Juliana International Airport, with ""huge chunks of the building [strewn] across the runway and a jet bridge snapped in half.""It demolished or severely damaged about 70% of Sint Maarten\'s houses, forcing thousands of residents into public shelters.There were 4 deaths and 23 injuries, 11 of which were serious, in the Dutch territory.Irma is considered the worst natural disaster to hit Sint Maarten; the extent of its damage far exceeded that of any previous hurricane.Total damages were estimated at €2.5 billion (US$2.98 billion).\n\nIrma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the French island of Saint Barthélemy, southeast of Saint Martin.Describing the extent of the destruction, one local compared it to ""a bomb that burned all vegetation,"" while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively ""erased the island from the map"".Violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments, with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation.Streets in the capital of Gustavia were turned into rushing rivers, which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture.The island\'s fire station was inundated with up to of flood waters.With scores of homes and much of the infrastructure destroyed, the majority of the island\'s population was left stranded and without water, electricity or phone service.The associated economic losses could exceed $480 million according to CEDIM\'s analysts.\n\nPreliminary assessments from the French government indicate that Hurricane Irma caused a combined €1.2 billion (US$1.43 billion) in insured losses across the French territories of Saint-Martin and Saint Barts.This total covered private property such as homes, vehicles and businesses (including lost revenue); the extent of the damage to infrastructural and public facilities remains undetermined.Nonetheless, this made Irma one of the costliest natural disasters to hit the French Republic in 50 years.\n\nOn January 30, 2018, roughly five months after Irma, an analysis was published indicating that an anemometer on the island recorded an unofficial gust to before failing.\n\nThe British Overseas Territory of Anguilla saw the eyewall of the storm pass over it on September 6.Many homes and schools were destroyed, and the island\'s only hospital was badly damaged.The devastation was particularly severe in East End, where the winds uprooted scores of trees and power poles and demolished a number of houses.In The Valley, the island\'s capital, the hurricane blew out the windows of government buildings.Rough seas inflicted heavy damage upon several bays and harbors, and a seaside restaurant was completely eradicated.About 90% of roads were left impassable.The island\'s air traffic control tower was damaged, exacerbating the already poor communication with the island.One death was reported on the island.Estimates of losses on the island total at least $190 million.\n\nLarge swells ahead of Irma washed ashore debris and sea life in Castries, Saint Lucia, blocking some roads.Seaside roads were inundated with water.One surfer was killed amid rough surf in Barbados after hitting a reef and breaking his neck.Trees were also destroyed.The hurricane\'s effects, such as violent seas and rattling trees, were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in Guadeloupe.Several houses were damaged.Around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm, leaving several communes in the dark without running water.Overall damage was limited to external parts of houses and trees that were blown onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seas.\n\nSaint Kitts and Nevis endured similar conditions to other islands.Blustery rainstorms triggered scattered power outages and disabled the island\'s water system, but per the International Red Cross, the islands were spared the level of destruction seen elsewhere.Still, Prime Minister Timothy Harris stated that property and infrastructure had sustained ""significant damage.""The Dutch territories of Saba and Sint Eustatius were also struck by the hurricane\'s winds, resulting in infrastructural damage, water shortages and telecommunication outages.Several houses were left uninhabitable.On Saba, the hurricane also defoliated trees and injured a few people.CEDIM\'s analysts expect economic losses of $20–65 million for the two islands.\n\nDamage in the British Virgin Islands was extensive.Numerous buildings and roads were destroyed on the island of Tortola, which bore the brunt of the hurricane\'s core.Four people were confirmed dead.Along Cane Garden Bay, the storm surge submerged several seaside bars and a gas station.Satellite images revealed many of the island\'s residential zones had been left in ruins.The hurricane passed over Necker Island, also causing severe damage and destroying the mansion of Richard Branson.\n\nMost homes and businesses were destroyed on the island of Jost Van Dyke, the smallest of the B.V.I.\'s four main islands.The Governor, Gus Jaspert, who had only been sworn into office 13 days previously, declared a state of emergency - the first time this has ever happened in the Territory.After the storm, restoration of electricity took approximately 5 months.\n\nIrma\'s effects in the U.S. Virgin Islands were most profound on Saint Thomas, where at least of rain fell, and on Saint John.Saint Thomas island suffered widespread structural damage, including to its police station and airport.Patients from the fourth and third floors of Charlotte Amalie\'s hospital had to be relocated to lower floors due to flooding from roof leaks.Three deaths were attributed to Irma on the island.On nearby Saint Croix, there were communication issues and some damage to the infrastructure.Saint John lost access to ferry and cargo services, along with access to the local airport.Due to its normal reliance on electricity from Saint Thomas, the island was left without power.Total damage from the three islands was at least $1.1 billion.\n\nThe hurricane passed north of Puerto Rico, but still caused significant damage to the United States territory.Along the coast, a tide gauge observed waves up to mean higher high water.Much of the main island experienced sustained tropical storm force winds, with a peak sustained wind speed of at a weather station along San Juan Bay, while the same site observed a peak wind gust of .However, on the island of Culebra, a wind gust of was reported.Mainly due to strong winds, approximately 1.1 million out of 1.5 million of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority\'s customers lost electricity.Portions of Puerto Rico received heavy rainfall, with a peak total of in Bayamón, causing seven rivers to reach flood stage, widespread flash flooding, and at least six landslides.\n\nThe most severely affected areas included the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques, as well as the northeastern, northern, and mountainous portions of the main island.On Culebra, the island suffered an almost complete loss of electrical and water services.At least 30 homes on the island were destroyed, while about 30 other experienced substantial damage.High winds also toppled a number of trees.The only telecommunications tower on Culebra sustained damage, cutting off outside communications for several hours.In rural Loíza, 79 homes were destroyed.Throughout Puerto Rico, 781 out of 1,600 telecommunications towers went out of commission, primarily due to power outages.At least 362,000 customers lost water services.Debris, mostly fallen trees, blocked at least 72 roads.Approximately 25% to 30% of banana, coffee, papaya, and plantain crops were damaged by strong winds, with losses to farmers estimated at $30.6 million.Approximately 1,530 homes experienced at least moderate damage, with 1,448 homes moderately damaged, 32 extensively damaged, and 50 completely destroyed.\n\nHurricane Irma was attributed to around $1 billion in damage, and the NHC attributed three fatalities to Irma in Puerto Rico, though four deaths were related to the storm.Two people died due to rainstorms ahead of the hurricane: one man died in Orocovis after falling off his ladder while repairing his roof; another man on the coast in Capitanejo died after being struck by lightning.Three nearby fishermen were burned by the same lightning strike, but survived.Two other people died during the hurricane: a woman died while being evacuated from her house in a wheelchair and fell, hitting her head; another person died in a car accident in Canóvanas.Governor Ricardo Rosselló declared the islands of Culebra and Vieques to be disaster areas.\n\nAlthough spared a direct hit, both the Dominican Republic and Haiti were affected by high winds and heavy rains.A bridge over the Dajabón River connecting the two countries was broken.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, the fishing community of Nagua sustained damage from waves that destroyed homes.55,000 soldiers were deployed to affected areas to help with the clean-up efforts.By the evening of September 7, the government had counted 2,721 damaged homes.\n\nIn Haiti, flooding one meter deep sat in residential neighborhoods in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives.Mudslides, destroyed homes, flooded crops, and infrastructure damage were reported in the northern part of the country.The total expanse of the flooding stretched from Môle-Saint-Nicolas in the west to the eastern border with the Dominican Republic.\n\nOn the evening of September 7, at 7:30 pm AST (23:30 UTC), Hurricane Irma reached the Turks and Caicos Islands.While the eye passed just south of the main islands, crossing over South Caicos and the Ambergris Cays, the most powerful winds on the northern side of the eye swept all of the islands for more than two hours.Communications infrastructure was destroyed.\n\nOn September 8, Minister of Infrastructure Goldray Ewing confirmed that damage to Providenciales was extensive, with the northwestern neighborhood of Blue Hill being ""gone"".The hospital in the capital, Cockburn Town, was heavily damaged.On South Caicos, 75% of roofs were lost.Total damage was estimated at over $500 million.\n\nIn the Bahamas, the eye of the storm passed over Duncan Town, the major settlement of the Ragged Islands chain, on September 8.It also passed ""almost directly over"" Inagua and South Acklins, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.\n\nDamages were largely confined to the southern islands starting the morning of September 8.On Mayaguana and Great Inagua, downed power lines knocked out communications.On Great Inagua, 70% of homes sustained roof damage, and the island\'s school lost its roof entirely.The Morton Salt Company\'s signature production facility, one of the major employers in the country, experienced millions of dollars in damages.The Acklins settlement of Salina Point was cut off from the rest of the island by flooding, while Crooked Island had widespread roof damage.In the northern Bahamas, the worst property damage came on September 10 as the outer bands of the system produced tornadic activity on Grand Bahama and Bimini.Damage and losses across The Bahamas amounted to $135 million.\n\nWhile Irma was making landfall in Florida, the ocean was drawn away from some western shorelines of the Bahamas due to strong easterly winds.\n\nEarly on September 9, Irma made landfall on the Camagüey Archipelago off the northern coast of Cuba, with sustained winds of .The strongest official sustained wind speed was , while the highest wind gust reached ; both were observed near Camila in Ciego de Ávila Province.The weather station at Esmeralda, Camagüey, was damaged, with the wind gauge destroyed.The north coast of Cuba experienced significant coastal flooding due to storm surge and abnormally high tides generated by the storm.Wave heights at Cayo Romano exceeded .Storm surge penetrated as far as inland in some areas of Villa Clara Province.Multiple locations on the island observed at least of rainfall, with a peak total of of precipitation at Topes de Collantes.\n\nA total of 158,554 homes experienced some degree of damage, of which 14,657 were destroyed; approximately 1.9 million people experienced the direct effects of Irma.The storm partially deroofed 103,691 homes, while 23,560 were completely deroofed.Irma damaged or destroyed 980 health facilities and 2,264 schools.Approximately 3.1 million people experienced disruptions to the water supply, while 246,707 people lost telephone service.About of roads were damaged.Crops also suffered extensively, with nearly affected by the storm.Throughout the country, the hurricane inflicted $13.185 billion in damage and killed 10 people, making Irma the costliest tropical cyclone in Cuban history.\n\nThe tourist areas of Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and Cayo Santa María and the nearby town of Caibarién received the brunt of the storm, with waves rolling through town and the characteristic one-story homes completely flooded.The storm most severely Ciego de Ávila and Villa Clara provinces.Flooding worsened as the hurricane moved west, pushing the storm surge along to the regions around Havana.By the afternoon, limited flooding was occurring in Havana, including around the Malecón.Portions of province coastal flooding surpassing that which was experienced during the Storm of the Century in 1993 and Hurricane Wilma in 2005.In the city of Santa Clara, 39 buildings collapsed.Rainfall resulted in several rivers reaching major flood stage.The town of Cabaiguán in Sancti Spíritus Province in particular suffered extensive inland flooding after the Zaza River swelled.\n\nHurricane Irma directly affected a major colony of American flamingos on Cuba\'s northern Cayo Coco.Early reports from Diario de Cuba indicated that several hundred flamingos had been killed by the storm, though other estimates ranged as high as several thousand birds.\n\nHurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida.Except for the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned.Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba, but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys.The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States.After surveying the aftermath of Irma, Florida governor Rick Scott said ""I thought we would see more damage""[on the mainland] but said ""he witnessed devastation in the Keys"".President Donald Trump commented on Twitter that the devastation in some places was ""far greater than anyone thought"".\n\nDamage in the United States was estimated at a minimum of $50 billion.At the time, Irma was the fourth costliest tropical cyclone in the United States, behind hurricanes Sandy in 2012, Harvey earlier that year, and Katrina in 2005.However, later in September 2017, Hurricane Maria became the third costliest United States tropical cyclone, causing Irma to fall to the fifth costliest.At least 92 people, 10 directly and 82 indirectly, died throughout the United States in relation to Irma: 84 in Florida, 3 in Georgia, 3 in South Carolina, and 2 in North Carolina.\n\nIrma struck the state less than two weeks after Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten had caused the worst flooding seen in western Florida in 20 years, which further worsened the impacts in the region.The storm\'s large wind field resulted in strong winds across much of Florida, except for the western Panhandle.The highest reported sustained wind speed was on Marco Island, while the strongest observed wind gust was , recorded near Naples, though wind gusts of likely occurred in the Middle Florida Keys.More than 7.7 million homes and businesses in Florida were left without electricity at some point – approximately 73% of state.Generally heavy amounts of rainfall were recorded to the east of the Irma\'s path, including a peak total of in Fort Pierce.Heavy precipitation – and storm surge, in some instances – overflowed at least 32 rivers and creeks, causing significant flooding, particularly along the St. Johns River and its tributaries.Many homes and businesses suffered damage or destruction, with more than 65,000 structures damaged to some degree in West Central and Southwest Florida alone.Agriculture experienced about $2.5 billion in damage.It was estimated that the cyclone caused at least $50 billion in damage, making Irma the costliest hurricane in Florida history, surpassing Hurricane Andrew, until it was itself surpassed by Hurricane Ian, 5 years later.\n\nThroughout Florida, at least 84 people died in storm-related incidents.About half of the deaths occurred from drowning, trauma, and carbon monoxide poisoning.Broward County had 21 fatalities, the most of any county in Florida.Among those deaths were 12 people at The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, a Hollywood nursing home.The patients died from sweltering heat worsened by the lack of air conditioning.The hurricane also left at least 14 deaths in Monroe County; 6 deaths in Orange County; 5 deaths each in Duval, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties; 4 deaths in both Highlands and Hillsborough counties; 3 deaths in both Marion and Polk counties; 2 deaths each in Collier, Hardee, Leon, Pinellas, St. Lucie, and Taylor counties; and 1 death in Hendry, Lake, Lee, Liberty, Manatee, Nassau, Okeechobee, Pasco, Seminole, St. Johns, and Volusia counties.\n\nWith Irma making landfall in Monroe County as a Category 4 hurricane, the Florida Keys were hardest hit area in the state.Strong winds and storm surge flooding caused major damage to buildings, trailer parks, boats, roads, the electricity supply, mobile phone coverage, internet access, sanitation, the water supply and the fuel supply throughout the island chain.An estimated storm surge occurred at Cudjoe Key, where Irma made landfall.Throughout the island, 625 homes sustained minor damage, 52 sustained major damage, and 81 were demolished.On Big Pine Key, one of the most devastated islands, 633 homes received minor impact, 299 homes received major impact, and 473 homes were completely destroyed.Overall in Monroe County, 27,649 homes experienced some degree of damage, including 1,179 homes being destroyed, 2,977 homes receiving major damage, and 5,361 suffering minor damage.\n\nAfter devastating the Keys, the storm then struck Collier County as a Category 3 hurricane.Several communities in the county suffered extensive damage, especially along the coast.Throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, 65 homes, including 44 mobile homes, were demolished, while 1,008 homes received major damage.Property damages in unincorporated areas alone reach about $320 million.Lee County was lashed by strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused prolonged flooding in some areas.More than 24,000 homes suffered some degree of damage, with almost 3,000 homes receiving major damage and 89 homes being destroyed.Damage in the county totaled about $857 million.\n\nImpact in much of the Miami metropolitan area was generally limited to extensive tree and fence damage, as well as widespread power outages.However, in Miami-Dade County, about 1,000 homes received major damage and about 50% of crops were lost.Storm surge caused coastal flooding from Homestead to Downtown Miami, as well as in portions of Miami Beach.Parts of the Florida Heartland were devastated by high winds and flooding, particularly Hendry and Highlands counties.In the former, which has most citrus trees of any county in Florida, about 60% of orange crops were lost.Throughout Hendry County, a total of 451 homes had minor damage, 131 homes suffered major damage, and 42 others were destroyed.In Highlands County, 13,138 businesses and homes were damaged to some degree, with 144 being destroyed, 963 sustaining major damage, and 2,408 receiving minor damage.In Orange County, wind gusts reached 79 mph at Orlando International Airport.A wind gust of 91 mph was also recorded in Orlando at the top of the Disney Contemporary Resort.Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central Florida left some wind damage and flooding, necessitating evacuations and rescues, including more than 200 people in Orlo Vista after hundreds of homes were flooded.A total of 2,999 business or homes were damaged in Lake County, 7,430 in Seminole County, and 3,457 in Volusia County.Additionally, eight tornadoes touched down in Brevard County, all of which caused damage.\n\nAlong much of the Gulf Coast of Florida, to the north of where Irma made landfall, negative storm surges were observed, with water retracting rather than pushing inland, causing little coastal flooding.However, on the opposite coast, extensive erosion and storm surge flooding occurred in the First Coast, especially in Duval and St. Johns counties.In Duval County, the St. Johns River crested at heights that exceeded records set during Hurricane Dora in 1964.Portions of Jacksonville experienced flooding, particularly the downtown area and the Riverside and San Marco neighborhoods, with about 350 people rescued in those sections of the city.Water reached about high in some homes.The city of Jacksonville suffered about $85 million in damage.\n\nIn St. Johns County, storm surge left extensive damage to oceanfront properties in Ponte Vedra Beach and Vilano Beach, with several becoming uninhabitable.Additionally, some riverfront businesses in St. Augustine\'s historic district were flooded due to storm surge from the Matanzas River.In nearby Clay County, rainfall and storm surge combined to cause extensive flooding along portions of the Black Creek and the St. Johns River, with record high crests at several locations along the former.About 350 people and 75 animals were rescued from floodwaters throughout the county.A total of 275 homes were destroyed, 175 were inflicted major damage, and 124 received minor damage.\n\nThree deaths were reported in Georgia due to falling trees and debris, along with widespread wind damage and power outages throughout the state primarily due to fallen trees.On Tybee Island, as well as St. Simons Island the storm surge caused extensive flooding.The tropical storm also did $54 million in damage in the state.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the third highest storm surge on record was recorded, reaching a height of approximately .By of September 12, almost 100,000 had lost power in Upstate South Carolina.Five people died in storm-related incidents across South Carolina, all from indirect incidents.The tropical storm caused damages totaling $500,000 in the state.\n\nLight damage occurred in other areas, including Tennessee.About 75,000 customers in North Carolina lost power due to Irma.It also caused $600,000 in damages in Alabama.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Irma\'s path through the West Indies and Caribbean, the devastation to roads, harbors and airports significantly impeded the transportation and distribution of relief supplies.Foreign countries moved to provide much of the initial aid.The British, Dutch, French, and United States governments sent warships and planes with supplies and manpower to the region.International leaders, including Dutch King Willem-Alexander and French President Emmanuel Macron, quickly moved to visit affected territories.\n\nSome of the affected countries and territories also offered assistance to each other.Cuba, which sustained extensive damage from the storm, sent 750 health workers to Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, Dominica, and Haiti.Government officials and members of the public in Puerto Rico delivered assistance and evacuated people stranded on other islands.The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services granted special 30-day humanitarian visas for British Virgin Islanders to stay in Puerto Rico.Hundreds of people stranded on Saint Martin were flown to the Dominican Republic on humanitarian grounds.\n\nIn response to Hurricane Jose\'s approach, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a mandatory evacuation on September 9 for any remaining residents on Barbuda.A Miami cargo plane landed on Antigua later that day, carrying over 60 tons (120,000 lbs) of relief supplies for the displaced storm victims—including bottled water, canned food and power generators.\n\nRFA Mounts Bay stationed itself near Anguilla and provided support and relief work to the island with its helicopters and 40 marines and army engineers.The ship delivered 6 tonnes of emergency aid to Anguilla and army engineers repaired a fuel leak at Anguilla\'s main petrol dump, restored power to the island\'s hospital and provided shelters for those left homeless by the hurricane.The ship arrived in the British Virgin Islands on September 8, 2017, to provide emergency relief to the islands, including providing shelters, food and water.HMS Ocean was diverted from the Mediterranean to provide relief from Gibraltar to the affected British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos on September 7, and aid was also supplied by the Department for International Development from their disaster response centre at Kemble Airfield.As part of a £32 million operation named Operation Ruman, nearly 500 UK military personnel with emergency relief were dispatched from RAF Brize Norton.This included the first deployment of No. 38 Expeditionary Air Wing with 3 RAF aircraft; 2 Airbus A400M Atlas and 1 C130J hercules to support relief efforts.\n\nThe British government also drafted 2 members of the UK police calibre into the region on September 10, and 53 police officers were drafted from RAF Brize Norton to the affected British Overseas Territories on September 15 to help maintain order.UK politicians, including the chairs of the foreign affairs and development select committees, criticized both the government\'s preparations for the storm and its response as inadequate.\n\nBy September 12, the Department for International Development had delivered more than 40 tonnes of aid into the region, including into Turks and Caicos, and 1,000 UK military troops were deployed in the region as part of relief efforts.The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, pledged an additional £25 million worth of funding as part of relief efforts in the region on September 13, 2017, and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Boris Johnson, said that a further 250 UK military personnel would be deployed into the area within the next few days.Anguilla\'s Chief Minister, Victor Banks, praised the British government\'s response to the storm and said that Boris Johnson\'s visit to the island ""sends a very positive signal to Anguillans that the British are serious about their response to this very severe hurricane"", but went on to say that the current financial commitment from the UK was not substantial enough.\n\nBy September 15, the United Kingdom had over 70 military personnel and 4 police officers in Anguilla and had delivered 15 tonnes of aid to the island.In the British Virgin Islands, Royal Marines had cleared the airfield so that it was operational for the delivery of aid into the islands, with more than 200 British military personnel and 54 UK police officers on the ground and 8 tonnes of aid delivered to the islands.120 British military personnel were on the ground in Turks and Caicos, and over 150 shelter kits and 720 liters of water were delivered to the islands on September 15.\n\nAmendments to international aid rules by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (or OECD) allowed for the UK government to provide access to £13 billion worth of aid to the affected British Overseas Territories, through the UK\'s Official Development Assistance (ODA) by November 2017.\n\nBy the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage.The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by Irma\'s eye, remained largely inaccessible for days.Assessments showed that 15% of the national telecommunications network had been affected, with at least one tower destroyed.Bahamasair resumed a limited domestic schedule on September 10, with international flights still cancelled due to existing and anticipated destruction at other destinations.\n\nThe worst devastation occurred on Ragged Island, over which Irma\'s eye had directly passed.After days of the National Emergency Management Agency not being able to physically reach the island, officials were finally able to inspect it; they promptly declared it uninhabitable.Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said that it was the worst disaster area he or his officials had ever seen, and that all remaining residents would need to leave, potentially permanently.Business leaders and other officials called for a new long-term development model to shift the population away from such sparsely-settled islands.\n\nOn Grand Bahama and Bimini, where tornadoes associated with Irma touched down on September 10, more than 100 people were left displaced.Infrastructure damage included docks, parks, and the power system.\n\nAside from tangible asset losses, Irma brought significant economic damages.International freight shipping was projected to be offline for a week, and costs for rebuilding supplies were inflated due to demand in the U.S.\n\nSwollen rivers contributed to worsening flooding in the days after the storm system left, resulting in additional evacuations.Officials resorted to using inflatable rafts to access affected areas.The national electrical infrastructure was said to be extensively damaged.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, flooding worsened following Irma\'s departure, leading the number of displaced persons to increase to more than 24,000 by September 8.President Danilo Medina ordered further evacuations due to at-risk dams, while the government banned swimming in rivers and ordered boats kept in port.More than 422,000 people were left without water due to 28 aqueducts being damaged.\n\nIn Haiti, officials stated that losses were greater than they could have been since people largely did not heed early preparation and evacuation warnings.At least 5,000 homes were flooded.One man died trying to cross a flooded river; another went missing and 17 were injured.The trash- and waste-contaminated floodwaters in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives led to fears of cholera outbreaks.Flooding continued to worsen days after the storm, as runoff from the mountains swelled rivers in low-lying farming communities.United Nations peacekeepers from Brazil were able to gain access to the flooded northwest region to provide urgent aid, but non-governmental organizations and Haitian economists warned that the estimated 30,000 victims would need longer-term assistance as well.Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant appointed a government commission to address Irma\'s effects, with Action Against Hunger in charge of humanitarian coordination.\n\nIn the USVI, residents and tourists alike were described as being in a state of traumatic shock.By September 7, the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship had arrived in the USVI to provide supplies, damage assessment, and evacuation assistance.Four additional warships, some of which had already been on their way to Texas to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief, were redirected to the region.At a September 10 news conference, Governor Kenneth Mapp described Irma as a ""horrific disaster"" for which ""[t]here will be no restorations or solutions in days or weeks.""The Federal Emergency Management Agency airlifted in goods for residents, who were subjected to a curfew.Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line agreed to transport tourists to Florida, contingent upon port availability following the state\'s own experience with Irma.\n\nOn Saint John, described as ""perhaps the site of Irma\'s worst devastation on American soil,"" it took six days for an active-theater disaster zone to be established, leading to criticism of the U.S. government response.The National Guard was delayed in reaching Saint John due to the number of overturned boats left in the harbor.The National Guard was brought in to maintain order, while the Coast Guard brought evacuees to cruise ships bound for San Juan and Miami.There was still no electricity on St. John in the middle of October 2017.\n\nBy September 9, more than one million Puerto Ricans were still without power, tens of thousands were without water, and several thousand were still in shelters.Hospitals were operating on generator power.The government was struggling to establish contact with the islands of Culebra and Vieques.By September 10, the main island had recovered enough to serve as a refuge for people stranded on other islands, including 1,200 tourists from Saint Martin and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Airlifts had brought more than 50 patients to Puerto Rico.\n\nFive months after Irma, two-thirds of the hospital beds on Saint Thomas were still unavailable, due to extensive physical damage and staffing shortages.\n\nDamage to Sint Maarten\'s harbour and to Princess Juliana International Airport left the Dutch part of Saint Martin unreachable, although the smaller Grand Case-Espérance Airport on the French side could be reopened by September 7 for supply aid by helicopter and airplane.The French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops on board a CASA/IPTN CN-235 aircraft.\n\nThe following day, the Dutch military was able to airlift dialysis patients off the island while also dropping leaflets to warn islanders about the rapidly approaching Hurricane Jose.Although the airport was closed, 435 students and faculty of the American University of the Caribbean were evacuated by the U.S. military.On September 10, Dutch King Willem-Alexander departed for the region, with intentions to visit Sint Maarten and other affected Dutch territories and commonwealth members.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron followed this announcement by stating his intentions to visit the French part of the island on September 12 in order to bring aid supplies.In response to criticism of the French handling of the disaster, 1,000 troops, police, and other emergency workers were sent to Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.\n\nOn both sides of Saint Martin, desperate conditions combined with food and water shortages in Irma\'s aftermath led to reports of violence, scavenging, and theft.In response, the French government increased its troop deployment to 2,200 and the Dutch government sent more than 600 military and police personnel.\n\nThe day after the hurricane hit Saint Barthelemy the French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops into the reopened Grand Case-Espérance Airport.On September 7 and 9, equipment and personnel were flown from France to Guadeloupe and Martinique.\n\nSporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm.\n\nOn September 11, Florida Governor Rick Scott conducted an aerial tour to survey the damage to the Keys.The Overseas Highway remained closed while authorities assessed the integrity of the 42 bridges along the route.Residents returning to the Keys were faced with a police roadblock, to the south of Florida City.USS Iwo Jima, USS New York and aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were sent to the Keys area to aid with the recovery.\n\nOn September 12, some residents were allowed to return into the Keys as far as Islamorada.Although road damage blocked entry any farther than Islamorada, bridges had been inspected and found safe to Sugarloaf Key.By late on September 12, the Overseas Highway had been repaired and the bridges inspected as safe for first responders to travel to Key West.On September 16, residents were free to return to Marathon.Residents were allowed to return to Key West the following day, although the Keys remained closed to tourists and a checkpoint remained in place in Florida City.\n\nDue mainly to the widespread loss of power, cell phone service was also reduced after battery backup power for cell phone towers ran out and backup generators ran out of fuel.In an impact report by the FCC, as of 11 AM EDT on September 12, 89 of 108 (82%) cell phone towers were non-functioning in Monroe County (Florida Keys), 154 of 212 (73%) were non-functioning in Collier County (Naples), 36 of 46 (78%) were non-functioning in Hendry County, and an additional six counties had 41-60% of cell phone towers not functioning, including Lee County (Fort Myers) and Miami-Dade County.\n\nNOAA released map-format aerial reconnaissance image data of damage from the storm.The imagery featured several areas of Florida: including the Florida Keys, the southwest coast of Florida from Marco Island to Punta Gorda, much of the northeast coast of Florida, and portions of the Jacksonville area.Portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts were also photographed.Additionally, the Sun-Sentinel published before and after photos of several landmarks in the Florida Keys.\n\nIn the days after the hurricane, due to the heavy rainfall, numerous rivers had flooded, including residential areas.Public health risks, such as diarrheal infections and mosquito-borne illnesses, remain from the flooding that resulted in the aftermath of the hurricane.A large concern from flooding is contamination because people become exposed to dirty floodwaters and the potential for contaminated water to enter the local water supply is significant.One example of an illness that can enter the water supply is leptospirosis, which is rat urine carries into the floodwaters.Untreated exposure to leptospirosis can cause kidney damage, meningitis, and liver failure.Noroviruses and other infections are also a risk.\n\nFollowing Irma\'s passage, a hand-carved wooden canoe was discovered on the banks of the Indian River and could be several hundred years old.The state has removed the canoe for examination and safe keeping.\n\nDue to Irma\'s and Hurricane Harvey\'s impact in Florida and Texas, U.S. employment declined in September 2017 for the first time since September 2010.The leisure and hospitality industries were especially hard hit, losing 111,000 jobs in September.\n\nIrma set multiple records for intensity, especially at easterly longitudes, time spent at such an intensity, and its intensity at landfall.When Irma reached Category 5 intensity with winds of at 11:45 UTC on September 5 at 57.7°W, it became the easternmost Atlantic hurricane of this strength on record, surpassing Hurricane David of 1979, later beaten by Hurricane Lorenzo 2 years later.By 00:15 UTC on September 6, Irma reached peak intensity with () winds and a minimum pressure of .This ties it with Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and Hurricane Rita of 2005 as the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed.Only five other Atlantic hurricanes have been recorded with wind speeds higher than Irma: Hurricane Allen of 1980, which had maximum sustained winds of , and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Gilbert of 1988, Hurricane Wilma of 2005, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, all of which had peak winds of .At the time, Irma was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; later surpassed by Hurricane Dorian, and was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007.In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category 5 strength winds, and the third-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, with a value of 64.9 units.Only the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane and Hurricane Ivan in 2004 achieved higher values.\n\nOn September 6, Irma made landfall on the islands of Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Virgin Gorda at peak strength.This ties Irma with cyclones Monica of 2006 and Winston of 2016, and typhoons Zeb of 1998 and Megi of 2010 as the seventh-strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall globally – in terms of sustained winds – trailing only Typhoon Goni of 2020 which bore winds of at landfall, Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 and Typhoon Meranti of 2016, which bore winds of at landfall, and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Typhoon Joan of 1959, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, which bore winds of at landfall.Irma is second to the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin, and is the first hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic at Category 5 status since Felix in 2007.Irma is the first recorded Category 5 hurricane to affect the northern Leeward Islands, and was one of the worst storms to hit the region on record, along with Hurricane Donna in 1960 and Hurricane Luis in 1995.In addition, Irma is only the second hurricane on record to make landfall in Cuba at Category 5 intensity, with the other being a hurricane in 1924.Furthermore, when Irma made landfall on Barbuda, Saint Martin, Virgin Gorda, and Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane, it became one of only two recorded Atlantic storms to make landfall in multiple nations at this strength; the other was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which struck both Eleuthera and the United States as a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nIrma made landfall in the Florida Keys with winds of and a pressure of , making it the strongest hurricane to strike Florida in terms of wind speed since Charley in 2004, and the most intense to strike the state in terms of barometric pressure since Andrew in 1992.In the span of two weeks, two Category 4 hurricanes—Harvey and Irma—struck the continental United States, the first time on record two Atlantic tropical cyclones of such strength made landfall on the country in the same hurricane season.This also marked only the third occurrence of two consecutive Atlantic storms making landfall in the United States as major hurricanes.The other two instances were the Great Charleston and Cheniere Caminada hurricanes in 1893, and hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne in 2004.\n\nBecause of the extensive damage and loss of life the hurricane caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Irma from its rotating naming lists in April 2018, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane.It was replaced with Idalia for the 2023 season.\n\nWeather of 2017 Tropical cyclones in 2017 List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes Operation RUMAN – UK military-civil disaster relief response to Hurricane Irma.List of Cuba hurricanes List

43,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Hurricane Irma', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'Hurricane Irma was an extremely powerful Cape Verde hurricane that caused widespread destruction across its path in early September 2017.Irma was the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the Leeward Islands on record, followed by Maria two weeks later.At the time, it was considered the most powerful hurricane on record in the open Atlantic region, outside of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, until it was surpassed by Hurricane Dorian two years later.It was also the third-strongest Atlantic hurricane at landfall ever recorded, just behind the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane and Dorian.The ninth named storm, fourth hurricane, second major hurricane, and first Category 5 hurricane of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Irma caused widespread and catastrophic damage throughout its long lifetime, particularly in the northeastern Caribbean and the Florida Keys.It was also the most intense hurricane to strike the continental United States since Katrina in 2005, the first major hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Wilma in the same year, and the first Category 4 hurricane to strike the state since Charley in 2004.The word Irmageddon was coined soon after the hurricane to describe the damage caused by the hurricane.\n\nIrma developed from a tropical wave near the Cape Verde Islands on August 30.Favorable conditions allowed Irma to rapidly intensify into a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson wind scale by late on August 31.The storm\'s intensity fluctuated between Categories 2 and 3 for the next several days, due to a series of eyewall replacement cycles.On September 4, Irma resumed intensifying, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by early on the next day.Early on September 6, Irma peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of and a minimum pressure of .Irma was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017 in terms of barometric pressure, and the strongest worldwide in 2017 in terms of wind speed.Another eyewall replacement cycle caused Irma to weaken back to a Category 4 hurricane, but the storm re-attained Category 5 status before making landfall in Cuba.Although Irma briefly weakened to a Category 2 storm while making landfall on Cuba, the system re-intensified to Category 4 status as it crossed the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, before making landfall on Cudjoe Key on September 10.Irma then weakened to Category 3 status, prior to another landfall in Florida on Marco Island later that day.The system degraded into a remnant low over Alabama and ultimately dissipated on September 13 over Missouri.\n\nThe storm caused catastrophic damage in Barbuda, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Anguilla, and the Virgin Islands as a Category 5 hurricane.The hurricane caused at least 134 deaths: one in Anguilla; one in Barbados; three in Barbuda; four in the British Virgin Islands; 10 in Cuba; 11 in the French West Indies; one in Haiti; three in Puerto Rico; four on the Dutch side of Sint Maarten; 92 in the contiguous United States, and four in the U.S. Virgin Islands.Hurricane Irma was the top Google searched term in the U.S. and globally in 2017.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa on August 26.The tropical wave moved off the coast of the continent late on August 27.Throughout the next two days, showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low-pressure area, as the system passed just south of and then through the Cape Verde Islands on August 29.Around 00:00 UTC on the following day, the system developed into a tropical depression just west of the Cape Verde Islands.Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Irma, based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates.With warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, strengthening was anticipated, with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier air.\n\nThe nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow, as an anticyclone became established over the system, with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images.Early on August 31, shortly after the development of a central dense overcast (CDO) and an eye feature, Irma underwent rapid intensification, becoming a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 UTC and then a Category 3 hurricane, becoming a major hurricane – around 00:00 UTC on September 1.Within a 48-hour period, the hurricane\'s intensity had increased by .On September 2, a ship passed to the west of the center of Irma, recording maximum winds of , which indicated that the eye of Irma remained compact.A strong high pressure system to the north of Irma caused the storm to move west-southwestward between September 2 and September 4.The first aircraft reconnaissance mission departed from Barbados on the afternoon of September 3, discovering an eye in diameter and surface winds of .\n\nOn September 4, after moving into more favorable conditions, Irma strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane.As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by 12:00 UTC on the following day, with winds of .The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at near 18:00 UTC on September 5. Irma acquired annular characteristics around this time, with the storm exhibiting a large, symmetric CDO and an impressive satellite appearance.Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern Leeward Islands.Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of Barbuda at peak intensity, with the storm\'s central minimum pressure having bottomed out at – this was the lowest in the Atlantic since Dean in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of .Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15 UTC on Sint Maarten, and at 16:30 UTC on Virgin Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands, though the storm\'s central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall.\n\nAs the hurricane moved away from the Virgin Islands late on September 6, observations from reconnaissance flights, as well as Doppler radar in San Juan, Puerto Rico, indicated an elliptical eye and double eyewalls.Late on September 6, the cyclone passed about north of Puerto Rico.Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of Hispaniola throughout the day on September 7.After beginning an eyewall replacement cycle, Irma weakened to a Category 4 hurricane as it passed south of the Turks and Caicos Islands early on September 8.This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category 5 intensity, the second-longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above – behind only the 1932 Cuba hurricane.At 05:00 UTC on September 8, Irma made landfall on the island of Little Inagua in the Bahamas with sustained winds of .The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a subtropical ridge to its north.Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category 5 intensity at 18:00 UTC that day east of Cuba as deep convection became more pronounced and organized.The hurricane then made landfall in Cayo Romano, Cuba, at 03:00 UTC on September 9, with winds of .This made Irma only the second Category 5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the 1924 Cuba hurricane.As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category 2 storm later on September 9.\n\nAfter slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards Florida around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental United States.Moving over the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, Irma quickly restrengthened to a Category 4 hurricane at 06:00 UTC on September 10, as deep convection improved and the eye became better defined.In addition, Irma\'s wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of and gale-force winds spanning in diameter.The cyclone made landfall in Cudjoe Key, Florida, at 13:00 UTC on September 10, at Category 4 intensity, with winds of .Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category 3 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30 UTC, in Marco Island, Florida, with sustained winds of .Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category 3 intensity hours after landfall.Passing east of Tampa as a weakening Category 1 hurricane around 06:00 UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation – though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds.The system finally weakened to a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC that day as it entered southern Georgia, while acquiring some extratropical characteristics.At 06:00 UTC on September 12, Irma degenerated to a remnant low just as it entered Alabama, as most of the deep convection had diminished.The remnants persisted for another day or so before dissipating over Missouri on September 13.\n\nGiven that Irma\'s forecast track was along much of the Caribbean island chain, hurricane warnings were issued for the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and parts of Hispaniola on September 5.\n\nIn Antigua and Barbuda, residents safeguarded their homes and cleaned up their properties in anticipation of strong winds.Emergency crews were put on standby at public shelters and hospitals by September 5 to assist with any evacuations.Expecting a direct hit, more than half of the residents on Barbuda took shelter, and relief supplies were preemptively mobilized.The National Emergency Management Organization on Saint Lucia urged small craft operators and swimmers to be mindful of forecasts for high surf.Small Craft Warnings and High Surf Advisories were hoisted for Dominica, where residents were urged to remain vigilant of the potential for high waves, landslides, and flooding.\n\nIn Guadeloupe, low-lying and cliff-edge homes were evacuated at the threat of flooding and erosion.Schools and public businesses closed on September 5 and 6.Hospitals stocked up on three days\' worth of supplies and checked the functionality of their generators.Of the island\'s 32 communes, 22 activated their emergency plans; 1,500 people were urged to take shelter.The island sustained relatively minor damage and became the base for relief efforts on Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.Though the core of the hurricane was expected to remain north of the island, a yellow alert was issued for Martinique due to the likelihood of rough seas.The island dispatched relief supplies and military reinforcements to its neighboring islands of Guadeloupe, Saint Martin.and Saint Barthélemy, which faced a greater risk of a direct impact.\n\nOn September 4, Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency.By September 6, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency had deployed response teams in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.Supplies, including food rations, medical supplies, and blankets, were pre-staged in strategic locations on the islands for distribution.\n\nOn September 5, the Dominican Republic activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage; the United States and Haiti followed suit two days later.According to officials, 11,200 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas prior to the storm\'s arrival.Approximately 7,400 tourists were moved to Santo Domingo, away from beach resorts.In Haiti, government officials and aid organizations struggled with early preparation and evacuation efforts.While some officials blamed reluctance and indifference on the part of the population, others ""admitted they were not prepared for the onslaught and no mandatory evacuation orders were in place ahead of Irma\'s approach.""Local officials contended that they had not received promised funds, supplies, or equipment from the national government.The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti prepared its 1,000 peacekeepers and engineers to assist.\n\nIn the Turks and Caicos, evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas starting September 5. Schools were closed, government buildings were boarded up, and shelters were opened.Officials spread warnings to residents in English, Creole, and Spanish via social media, radio, SMS text, and WhatsApp.In The Bahamas, the government began preparations the week prior to the hurricane\'s arrival, including securing national sports facilities to use as shelters.By September 7, the government had evacuated 1,609 people by air from the southern islands, including 365 from Bimini.Controlled cutting of the power supply to southern and central Bahamian islands was conducted in advance of the storm.Shelters were made available, though usage was low due to most evacuees staying with family on other islands.Of the 2,679 foreign tourists still in The Bahamas on September 7, about 1,200 were being housed at Atlantis Paradise Island, one of the most hurricane-ready structures in the country.\n\nIn Cuba, meteorologists did not initially predict a direct hit.Fuel conservation was enacted in Camagüey Province to ensure that enough would be available during post-storm power outages.The Civil Defense evacuated nearly one million people from low-lying areas, including thousands of Canadian and European tourists in the Jardines del Rey.Dolphins at a Cayo Guillermo resort were evacuated by helicopter.\n\nThe NHC issued several watches and warnings for the Southeastern United States.The first watches and warnings were issued at 15:00 UTC on September 7, which was a hurricane watch from the Jupiter Inlet to Bonita Beach, including the Florida Keys and Lake Okeechobee.The watches and warnings were extended into Georgia and South Carolina on September 9.At 21:00 UTC on that day, the advisories reached their maximum extent, with a hurricane warning covering the entire east coast of the state, the west coast from Indian Pass southward, and the Florida Keys; a hurricane watch was in place from the Florida–Georgia state line to Edisto Beach, South Carolina; and there were two tropical storm warnings, one in Florida from Indian Pass to the Okaloosa–Walton county line and the other from the Florida–Georgia state line to the South Santee River in South Carolina.Watches and warnings were gradually discontinued as Irma moved inland and weakened, with all of them canceled by early on September 12.\n\nOn September 4, Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency.Governor Scott placed 100 members of the Florida National Guard on duty to assist in preparations.All 7,000 troops were ordered to be on duty by September 8.Officials advised residents to stock their hurricane kits.The state coordinated with electrical companies in order for power outages to be restored as quickly as possible, extending resources such as equipment, fuel, and lodging for the approximately 24,000 restoration personnel who had been activated.Governor Scott suspended tolls on all toll roads in Florida, including the turnpike.All state offices in Florida were closed from September 8 to September 11, while public schools, state colleges, and state universities in all 67 counties were closed during the same period.The Florida Department of Education coordinated with school districts as the need for transportation by school buses and opening shelters arose.By September 9, more than 150 state parks were closed.Throughout the state, almost 700 emergency shelters were opened.The shelters collectively housed about 191,764 people, with more than 40% of them staying in a shelter in South Florida.Additionally, more than 60 special needs shelters were opened, which housed more than 5,000 people by September 9.\n\nMany airports across the state, particularly in Central and South Florida, were closed.Nearly 9,000 flights intending to arrive in or depart from Florida were canceled.Along Florida\'s coasts, most seaports were closed or opened with restricted access.For the fifth time in its 45-year history, the Walt Disney World Resort was completely closed due to the storm.Its theme parks, water parks, and Disney Springs were all closed by 9:00 p.m. on September 9 and remained closed until September 12.Other Orlando-area theme parks, including Universal Orlando Resort and SeaWorld Orlando, were also closed.The Kennedy Space Center was closed from September 8 to September 15.\n\nAn estimated 6.5 million Floridians were ordered to evacuate, mostly those living on barrier islands or in coastal areas; in mobile or sub-standard homes; and in low-lying or flood prone areas.Mandatory evacuations were ordered for portions of Brevard, Broward, Citrus, Collier, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Glades, Hendry, Hernando, Indian River, Lee, Martin, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Lucie, Sumter, and Volusia counties.All of Monroe County, where the Florida Keys are located, was placed under a mandatory evacuation.Residents in communities near the southern half of Lake Okeechobee were also ordered to leave.Additionally, voluntary evacuation notices were issued for all or parts of Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Charlotte, Columbia, Desoto, Hardee, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lake, Manatee, Okeechobee, Osceola, and Polk counties.\n\nA record 6.5 million Floridians evacuated, making it the largest evacuation in the state\'s history.Evacuees caused significant traffic congestion on northbound Interstate 95, Interstate 75, and Florida\'s Turnpike, exacerbated by the fact that the entire Florida peninsula was within the cone of uncertainty in the NHC\'s forecast path in the days before the storm, so evacuees from both coasts headed north, as evacuees would not be safer by fleeing to the opposite coast.Fuel was in short supply throughout peninsular Florida during the week before Irma\'s arrival, especially along evacuation routes, leading to hours-long lines at fuel stations and even escorts of fuel trucks by the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nUse of the left shoulder as a lane for moving traffic was allowed on northbound Interstate 75 from Wildwood to the Georgia state line beginning September 8 and on eastbound Interstate 4 from Tampa to State Road 429 near Celebration for a few hours on September 9.It was the first time that the shoulder-use plan, which was introduced at the start of the 2017 hurricane season, was implemented by the state for hurricane evacuations.The shoulder-use plan was implemented in place of labor- and resource-intensive contraflow lane reversal, in which both sides of an interstate highway are used for one direction of traffic.\n\nOfficials from the Environmental Protection Agency, which had been criticized for its response to Hurricane Harvey, took special measures to inspect and secure hazardous materials, especially at Superfund sites.Direct Relief, a disaster relief organization, coordinated with local health centers and provided resources to help facilities on the front lines of Floridian and Puerto Rican communities.\n\nGeorgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency initially for all six coastal counties on September 6, but eventually expanded the declaration to 94 counties south of Atlanta metropolitan area, and then the entire state on September 10.Atlanta was placed under its first-ever tropical storm warning.Governor Deal ordered mandatory evacuations for all areas east of Interstate 95 on September 7, before extending the order to the entirety of Chatham County and low-lying areas west of I-95 on the following day.In total, 540,000 people on the Georgia coast were ordered to leave.Contraflow lane reversal for Interstate 16 took effect on the morning of September 9 from Savannah to Dublin, Georgia.All Georgia state parks were open for free to evacuees, as was the 800-acre camping area at Atlanta Motor Speedway.Reversible HOT lanes on Interstate 75 in Georgia through south metro Atlanta were open 24 hours northbound with no tolls.\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on September 6, with South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster following suit the same day.Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency on September 8 in order to protect Virginia residents and to mobilize resources in support of neighboring states.Officials in New Orleans stated that there would not be much time for preparations if Irma failed to make the projected northward turn, but that South Texas or Florida would not be a good evacuation destination.On September 10, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam issued an executive order allowing medical professionals in other states to practice in Tennessee to aid Hurricane Irma evacuees.This order also allowed pharmacies to give out 14-day supplies of medicine, and gave women and children from outside the state the ability to participate in the Tennessee Department of Health programs.Bristol Motor Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway, and Charlotte Motor Speedway all opened their campgrounds to evacuees free of charge.\n\nIn professional sports, the Miami Dolphins–Tampa Bay Buccaneers game scheduled for September 10 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was postponed to November 19 due to the storm\'s threat.The Dolphins left early for their road game against the Los Angeles Chargers.The Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees moved their September 11–13 series from Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg to Citi Field in Queens.Minor League Baseball\'s Florida State League, Carolina League, and Southern League called off their championship finals and as a result, named their division series winners league co-champions.The Miami FC versus San Francisco Deltas match on September 10 was cancelled so the players and staff could prepare for the storm with their families.The Orlando Pride of the National Women\'s Soccer League rescheduled their September 9 match to September 7. Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer did not have any scheduled home games in September, but was unable to return to training facilities in Orlando due to Hurricane Irma.\n\nIn college football, the UCF Knights-Memphis Tigers game scheduled for September 9 was moved to September 30, replacing UCF\'s game against Maine and Memphis game against Georgia State.UCF also cancelled their game against Georgia Tech on September 16, as UCF\'s stadium hosted the National Guard.The USF Bulls-Connecticut Huskies football game was also cancelled.The Miami Hurricanes–Arkansas State Redwolves game scheduled for September 9 at Centennial Bank Stadium in Arkansas was canceled due to travel concerns for the University of Miami.The Florida Gators-Northern Colorado Bears match in Gainesville scheduled for September 9 was cancelled.The Florida State Seminoles contest against the Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks was canceled on September 8.The Seminoles\' rivalry game with the Hurricanes in Tallahassee, originally scheduled for September 16, was postponed tp October 7.The FIU Panthers game against the Alcorn State Braves was moved up a day and relocated to Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.The Georgia Southern Eagles game against the New Hampshire Wildcats on September 9 was also moved to Legion Field for that day.\n\nAs of September 5, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding was running dangerously low, due to its response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas the previous week, prompting the Trump administration to request an immediate $8 billion in additional funding as Irma approached Florida.Given the rate that current funds are being consumed and the catastrophic damage, the United States Senate almost doubled the requested amount to $15.3 billion, with the understanding that this would only be about 10% of what will be required for responding to Harvey.\n\nHurricane Irma\'s path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating, with landfalls in Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Martin, the Bahamas, Cuba, and the United States, all at major hurricane intensity.Furthermore, the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences.Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria.\n\nThe eyewall of the hurricane moved over Barbuda near its record peak intensity early on September 6; a weather station observed a wind gust of .The same station also recorded a minimum barometric pressure of .The exact state of the island remained unclear for hours after Irma\'s passage, as downed phone lines ceased all communication with nearby islands.Later that afternoon, Prime Minister Gaston Browne surveyed the territory by helicopter, revealing an effectively uninhabitable island.Irma damaged or destroyed 95% of the structures on Barbuda, including its hospital, schools, and both of its hotels; it completely flattened some residential blocks while submerging others.The destruction rendered the island\'s sole airport and much of its infrastructure inoperative—including water and telecommunication services—which further hampered relief efforts.Property damage on Barbuda ranged from $150 million to $300 million.A total of three storm-related deaths were reported on the island.\n\nIn addition to the catastrophic impact on Barbuda\'s human residents, concern turned to the storm\'s effects on the island\'s wildlife.The island\'s only endemic bird, the near-threatened Barbuda warbler, numbered less than 2,000 individuals prior to the hurricane.For some time it was unknown if the warbler survived the hurricane or its aftermath; however within a few months it was confirmed that not only did the species survive, but the most of the birds survived the storm.Barbuda\'s Codrington Lagoon, home to the largest colony of magnificent frigatebirds in the Caribbean, with an estimated 2,500 nesting pairs, was also inundated by the storm surge.\n\nRemaining just outside of Irma\'s strongest windfield, Antigua sustained less severe damage, in the form of leveled roofs and fences, downed power poles and lines, and uprooted trees.Some street flooding also took place in low-lying areas.Three people were treated for minor storm-related injuries.Forensic disaster analysts from the Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM), a Germany-based risk management agency, estimate that economic losses for Antigua and Barbuda will exceed $120 million.\n\nOn the morning of September 6, Irma\'s center crossed the island of Saint Martin while the storm was at peak intensity, sweeping away entire structures, submerging roads and cars, and triggering an island-wide blackout.Irma\'s extreme winds ripped trees out of the ground and sent vehicles and debris from damaged structures scattered across the territory.On the French side of Saint-Martin, entire marinas around Marigot were left in ruins, littered with the stranded remnants of boats that had smashed into each other.A hotel caught on fire, but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze.Another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor.Media images depicted devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds had shattered their windows.Irma killed four people on the French side of the island and injured 50 others, one of whom was in critical condition.As many as 95% of the buildings there were damaged to some degree; 60% of those were totally uninhabitable.Estimates from CEDIM indicate a minimum of $950 million worth of economic losses.Total losses exceeded €3.5 billion (US$4.17 billion).\n\nA similar situation unfolded in Sint Maarten, Saint Martin\'s Dutch half, as intense winds ripped through buildings and lifted vehicles aloft ""as if they were matches"".The hurricane wreaked havoc on Princess Juliana International Airport, with ""huge chunks of the building [strewn] across the runway and a jet bridge snapped in half.""It demolished or severely damaged about 70% of Sint Maarten\'s houses, forcing thousands of residents into public shelters.There were 4 deaths and 23 injuries, 11 of which were serious, in the Dutch territory.Irma is considered the worst natural disaster to hit Sint Maarten; the extent of its damage far exceeded that of any previous hurricane.Total damages were estimated at €2.5 billion (US$2.98 billion).\n\nIrma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the French island of Saint Barthélemy, southeast of Saint Martin.Describing the extent of the destruction, one local compared it to ""a bomb that burned all vegetation,"" while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively ""erased the island from the map"".Violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments, with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation.Streets in the capital of Gustavia were turned into rushing rivers, which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture.The island\'s fire station was inundated with up to of flood waters.With scores of homes and much of the infrastructure destroyed, the majority of the island\'s population was left stranded and without water, electricity or phone service.The associated economic losses could exceed $480 million according to CEDIM\'s analysts.\n\nPreliminary assessments from the French government indicate that Hurricane Irma caused a combined €1.2 billion (US$1.43 billion) in insured losses across the French territories of Saint-Martin and Saint Barts.This total covered private property such as homes, vehicles and businesses (including lost revenue); the extent of the damage to infrastructural and public facilities remains undetermined.Nonetheless, this made Irma one of the costliest natural disasters to hit the French Republic in 50 years.\n\nOn January 30, 2018, roughly five months after Irma, an analysis was published indicating that an anemometer on the island recorded an unofficial gust to before failing.\n\nThe British Overseas Territory of Anguilla saw the eyewall of the storm pass over it on September 6.Many homes and schools were destroyed, and the island\'s only hospital was badly damaged.The devastation was particularly severe in East End, where the winds uprooted scores of trees and power poles and demolished a number of houses.In The Valley, the island\'s capital, the hurricane blew out the windows of government buildings.Rough seas inflicted heavy damage upon several bays and harbors, and a seaside restaurant was completely eradicated.About 90% of roads were left impassable.The island\'s air traffic control tower was damaged, exacerbating the already poor communication with the island.One death was reported on the island.Estimates of losses on the island total at least $190 million.\n\nLarge swells ahead of Irma washed ashore debris and sea life in Castries, Saint Lucia, blocking some roads.Seaside roads were inundated with water.One surfer was killed amid rough surf in Barbados after hitting a reef and breaking his neck.Trees were also destroyed.The hurricane\'s effects, such as violent seas and rattling trees, were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in Guadeloupe.Several houses were damaged.Around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm, leaving several communes in the dark without running water.Overall damage was limited to external parts of houses and trees that were blown onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seas.\n\nSaint Kitts and Nevis endured similar conditions to other islands.Blustery rainstorms triggered scattered power outages and disabled the island\'s water system, but per the International Red Cross, the islands were spared the level of destruction seen elsewhere.Still, Prime Minister Timothy Harris stated that property and infrastructure had sustained ""significant damage.""The Dutch territories of Saba and Sint Eustatius were also struck by the hurricane\'s winds, resulting in infrastructural damage, water shortages and telecommunication outages.Several houses were left uninhabitable.On Saba, the hurricane also defoliated trees and injured a few people.CEDIM\'s analysts expect economic losses of $20–65 million for the two islands.\n\nDamage in the British Virgin Islands was extensive.Numerous buildings and roads were destroyed on the island of Tortola, which bore the brunt of the hurricane\'s core.Four people were confirmed dead.Along Cane Garden Bay, the storm surge submerged several seaside bars and a gas station.Satellite images revealed many of the island\'s residential zones had been left in ruins.The hurricane passed over Necker Island, also causing severe damage and destroying the mansion of Richard Branson.\n\nMost homes and businesses were destroyed on the island of Jost Van Dyke, the smallest of the B.V.I.\'s four main islands.The Governor, Gus Jaspert, who had only been sworn into office 13 days previously, declared a state of emergency - the first time this has ever happened in the Territory.After the storm, restoration of electricity took approximately 5 months.\n\nIrma\'s effects in the U.S. Virgin Islands were most profound on Saint Thomas, where at least of rain fell, and on Saint John.Saint Thomas island suffered widespread structural damage, including to its police station and airport.Patients from the fourth and third floors of Charlotte Amalie\'s hospital had to be relocated to lower floors due to flooding from roof leaks.Three deaths were attributed to Irma on the island.On nearby Saint Croix, there were communication issues and some damage to the infrastructure.Saint John lost access to ferry and cargo services, along with access to the local airport.Due to its normal reliance on electricity from Saint Thomas, the island was left without power.Total damage from the three islands was at least $1.1 billion.\n\nThe hurricane passed north of Puerto Rico, but still caused significant damage to the United States territory.Along the coast, a tide gauge observed waves up to mean higher high water.Much of the main island experienced sustained tropical storm force winds, with a peak sustained wind speed of at a weather station along San Juan Bay, while the same site observed a peak wind gust of .However, on the island of Culebra, a wind gust of was reported.Mainly due to strong winds, approximately 1.1 million out of 1.5 million of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority\'s customers lost electricity.Portions of Puerto Rico received heavy rainfall, with a peak total of in Bayamón, causing seven rivers to reach flood stage, widespread flash flooding, and at least six landslides.\n\nThe most severely affected areas included the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques, as well as the northeastern, northern, and mountainous portions of the main island.On Culebra, the island suffered an almost complete loss of electrical and water services.At least 30 homes on the island were destroyed, while about 30 other experienced substantial damage.High winds also toppled a number of trees.The only telecommunications tower on Culebra sustained damage, cutting off outside communications for several hours.In rural Loíza, 79 homes were destroyed.Throughout Puerto Rico, 781 out of 1,600 telecommunications towers went out of commission, primarily due to power outages.At least 362,000 customers lost water services.Debris, mostly fallen trees, blocked at least 72 roads.Approximately 25% to 30% of banana, coffee, papaya, and plantain crops were damaged by strong winds, with losses to farmers estimated at $30.6 million.Approximately 1,530 homes experienced at least moderate damage, with 1,448 homes moderately damaged, 32 extensively damaged, and 50 completely destroyed.\n\nHurricane Irma was attributed to around $1 billion in damage, and the NHC attributed three fatalities to Irma in Puerto Rico, though four deaths were related to the storm.Two people died due to rainstorms ahead of the hurricane: one man died in Orocovis after falling off his ladder while repairing his roof; another man on the coast in Capitanejo died after being struck by lightning.Three nearby fishermen were burned by the same lightning strike, but survived.Two other people died during the hurricane: a woman died while being evacuated from her house in a wheelchair and fell, hitting her head; another person died in a car accident in Canóvanas.Governor Ricardo Rosselló declared the islands of Culebra and Vieques to be disaster areas.\n\nAlthough spared a direct hit, both the Dominican Republic and Haiti were affected by high winds and heavy rains.A bridge over the Dajabón River connecting the two countries was broken.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, the fishing community of Nagua sustained damage from waves that destroyed homes.55,000 soldiers were deployed to affected areas to help with the clean-up efforts.By the evening of September 7, the government had counted 2,721 damaged homes.\n\nIn Haiti, flooding one meter deep sat in residential neighborhoods in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives.Mudslides, destroyed homes, flooded crops, and infrastructure damage were reported in the northern part of the country.The total expanse of the flooding stretched from Môle-Saint-Nicolas in the west to the eastern border with the Dominican Republic.\n\nOn the evening of September 7, at 7:30 pm AST (23:30 UTC), Hurricane Irma reached the Turks and Caicos Islands.While the eye passed just south of the main islands, crossing over South Caicos and the Ambergris Cays, the most powerful winds on the northern side of the eye swept all of the islands for more than two hours.Communications infrastructure was destroyed.\n\nOn September 8, Minister of Infrastructure Goldray Ewing confirmed that damage to Providenciales was extensive, with the northwestern neighborhood of Blue Hill being ""gone"".The hospital in the capital, Cockburn Town, was heavily damaged.On South Caicos, 75% of roofs were lost.Total damage was estimated at over $500 million.\n\nIn the Bahamas, the eye of the storm passed over Duncan Town, the major settlement of the Ragged Islands chain, on September 8.It also passed ""almost directly over"" Inagua and South Acklins, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.\n\nDamages were largely confined to the southern islands starting the morning of September 8.On Mayaguana and Great Inagua, downed power lines knocked out communications.On Great Inagua, 70% of homes sustained roof damage, and the island\'s school lost its roof entirely.The Morton Salt Company\'s signature production facility, one of the major employers in the country, experienced millions of dollars in damages.The Acklins settlement of Salina Point was cut off from the rest of the island by flooding, while Crooked Island had widespread roof damage.In the northern Bahamas, the worst property damage came on September 10 as the outer bands of the system produced tornadic activity on Grand Bahama and Bimini.Damage and losses across The Bahamas amounted to $135 million.\n\nWhile Irma was making landfall in Florida, the ocean was drawn away from some western shorelines of the Bahamas due to strong easterly winds.\n\nEarly on September 9, Irma made landfall on the Camagüey Archipelago off the northern coast of Cuba, with sustained winds of .The strongest official sustained wind speed was , while the highest wind gust reached ; both were observed near Camila in Ciego de Ávila Province.The weather station at Esmeralda, Camagüey, was damaged, with the wind gauge destroyed.The north coast of Cuba experienced significant coastal flooding due to storm surge and abnormally high tides generated by the storm.Wave heights at Cayo Romano exceeded .Storm surge penetrated as far as inland in some areas of Villa Clara Province.Multiple locations on the island observed at least of rainfall, with a peak total of of precipitation at Topes de Collantes.\n\nA total of 158,554 homes experienced some degree of damage, of which 14,657 were destroyed; approximately 1.9 million people experienced the direct effects of Irma.The storm partially deroofed 103,691 homes, while 23,560 were completely deroofed.Irma damaged or destroyed 980 health facilities and 2,264 schools.Approximately 3.1 million people experienced disruptions to the water supply, while 246,707 people lost telephone service.About of roads were damaged.Crops also suffered extensively, with nearly affected by the storm.Throughout the country, the hurricane inflicted $13.185 billion in damage and killed 10 people, making Irma the costliest tropical cyclone in Cuban history.\n\nThe tourist areas of Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and Cayo Santa María and the nearby town of Caibarién received the brunt of the storm, with waves rolling through town and the characteristic one-story homes completely flooded.The storm most severely Ciego de Ávila and Villa Clara provinces.Flooding worsened as the hurricane moved west, pushing the storm surge along to the regions around Havana.By the afternoon, limited flooding was occurring in Havana, including around the Malecón.Portions of province coastal flooding surpassing that which was experienced during the Storm of the Century in 1993 and Hurricane Wilma in 2005.In the city of Santa Clara, 39 buildings collapsed.Rainfall resulted in several rivers reaching major flood stage.The town of Cabaiguán in Sancti Spíritus Province in particular suffered extensive inland flooding after the Zaza River swelled.\n\nHurricane Irma directly affected a major colony of American flamingos on Cuba\'s northern Cayo Coco.Early reports from Diario de Cuba indicated that several hundred flamingos had been killed by the storm, though other estimates ranged as high as several thousand birds.\n\nHurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida.Except for the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned.Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba, but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys.The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States.After surveying the aftermath of Irma, Florida governor Rick Scott said ""I thought we would see more damage""[on the mainland] but said ""he witnessed devastation in the Keys"".President Donald Trump commented on Twitter that the devastation in some places was ""far greater than anyone thought"".\n\nDamage in the United States was estimated at a minimum of $50 billion.At the time, Irma was the fourth costliest tropical cyclone in the United States, behind hurricanes Sandy in 2012, Harvey earlier that year, and Katrina in 2005.However, later in September 2017, Hurricane Maria became the third costliest United States tropical cyclone, causing Irma to fall to the fifth costliest.At least 92 people, 10 directly and 82 indirectly, died throughout the United States in relation to Irma: 84 in Florida, 3 in Georgia, 3 in South Carolina, and 2 in North Carolina.\n\nIrma struck the state less than two weeks after Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten had caused the worst flooding seen in western Florida in 20 years, which further worsened the impacts in the region.The storm\'s large wind field resulted in strong winds across much of Florida, except for the western Panhandle.The highest reported sustained wind speed was on Marco Island, while the strongest observed wind gust was , recorded near Naples, though wind gusts of likely occurred in the Middle Florida Keys.More than 7.7 million homes and businesses in Florida were left without electricity at some point – approximately 73% of state.Generally heavy amounts of rainfall were recorded to the east of the Irma\'s path, including a peak total of in Fort Pierce.Heavy precipitation – and storm surge, in some instances – overflowed at least 32 rivers and creeks, causing significant flooding, particularly along the St. Johns River and its tributaries.Many homes and businesses suffered damage or destruction, with more than 65,000 structures damaged to some degree in West Central and Southwest Florida alone.Agriculture experienced about $2.5 billion in damage.It was estimated that the cyclone caused at least $50 billion in damage, making Irma the costliest hurricane in Florida history, surpassing Hurricane Andrew, until it was itself surpassed by Hurricane Ian, 5 years later.\n\nThroughout Florida, at least 84 people died in storm-related incidents.About half of the deaths occurred from drowning, trauma, and carbon monoxide poisoning.Broward County had 21 fatalities, the most of any county in Florida.Among those deaths were 12 people at The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, a Hollywood nursing home.The patients died from sweltering heat worsened by the lack of air conditioning.The hurricane also left at least 14 deaths in Monroe County; 6 deaths in Orange County; 5 deaths each in Duval, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties; 4 deaths in both Highlands and Hillsborough counties; 3 deaths in both Marion and Polk counties; 2 deaths each in Collier, Hardee, Leon, Pinellas, St. Lucie, and Taylor counties; and 1 death in Hendry, Lake, Lee, Liberty, Manatee, Nassau, Okeechobee, Pasco, Seminole, St. Johns, and Volusia counties.\n\nWith Irma making landfall in Monroe County as a Category 4 hurricane, the Florida Keys were hardest hit area in the state.Strong winds and storm surge flooding caused major damage to buildings, trailer parks, boats, roads, the electricity supply, mobile phone coverage, internet access, sanitation, the water supply and the fuel supply throughout the island chain.An estimated storm surge occurred at Cudjoe Key, where Irma made landfall.Throughout the island, 625 homes sustained minor damage, 52 sustained major damage, and 81 were demolished.On Big Pine Key, one of the most devastated islands, 633 homes received minor impact, 299 homes received major impact, and 473 homes were completely destroyed.Overall in Monroe County, 27,649 homes experienced some degree of damage, including 1,179 homes being destroyed, 2,977 homes receiving major damage, and 5,361 suffering minor damage.\n\nAfter devastating the Keys, the storm then struck Collier County as a Category 3 hurricane.Several communities in the county suffered extensive damage, especially along the coast.Throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, 65 homes, including 44 mobile homes, were demolished, while 1,008 homes received major damage.Property damages in unincorporated areas alone reach about $320 million.Lee County was lashed by strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused prolonged flooding in some areas.More than 24,000 homes suffered some degree of damage, with almost 3,000 homes receiving major damage and 89 homes being destroyed.Damage in the county totaled about $857 million.\n\nImpact in much of the Miami metropolitan area was generally limited to extensive tree and fence damage, as well as widespread power outages.However, in Miami-Dade County, about 1,000 homes received major damage and about 50% of crops were lost.Storm surge caused coastal flooding from Homestead to Downtown Miami, as well as in portions of Miami Beach.Parts of the Florida Heartland were devastated by high winds and flooding, particularly Hendry and Highlands counties.In the former, which has most citrus trees of any county in Florida, about 60% of orange crops were lost.Throughout Hendry County, a total of 451 homes had minor damage, 131 homes suffered major damage, and 42 others were destroyed.In Highlands County, 13,138 businesses and homes were damaged to some degree, with 144 being destroyed, 963 sustaining major damage, and 2,408 receiving minor damage.In Orange County, wind gusts reached 79 mph at Orlando International Airport.A wind gust of 91 mph was also recorded in Orlando at the top of the Disney Contemporary Resort.Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central Florida left some wind damage and flooding, necessitating evacuations and rescues, including more than 200 people in Orlo Vista after hundreds of homes were flooded.A total of 2,999 business or homes were damaged in Lake County, 7,430 in Seminole County, and 3,457 in Volusia County.Additionally, eight tornadoes touched down in Brevard County, all of which caused damage.\n\nAlong much of the Gulf Coast of Florida, to the north of where Irma made landfall, negative storm surges were observed, with water retracting rather than pushing inland, causing little coastal flooding.However, on the opposite coast, extensive erosion and storm surge flooding occurred in the First Coast, especially in Duval and St. Johns counties.In Duval County, the St. Johns River crested at heights that exceeded records set during Hurricane Dora in 1964.Portions of Jacksonville experienced flooding, particularly the downtown area and the Riverside and San Marco neighborhoods, with about 350 people rescued in those sections of the city.Water reached about high in some homes.The city of Jacksonville suffered about $85 million in damage.\n\nIn St. Johns County, storm surge left extensive damage to oceanfront properties in Ponte Vedra Beach and Vilano Beach, with several becoming uninhabitable.Additionally, some riverfront businesses in St. Augustine\'s historic district were flooded due to storm surge from the Matanzas River.In nearby Clay County, rainfall and storm surge combined to cause extensive flooding along portions of the Black Creek and the St. Johns River, with record high crests at several locations along the former.About 350 people and 75 animals were rescued from floodwaters throughout the county.A total of 275 homes were destroyed, 175 were inflicted major damage, and 124 received minor damage.\n\nThree deaths were reported in Georgia due to falling trees and debris, along with widespread wind damage and power outages throughout the state primarily due to fallen trees.On Tybee Island, as well as St. Simons Island the storm surge caused extensive flooding.The tropical storm also did $54 million in damage in the state.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the third highest storm surge on record was recorded, reaching a height of approximately .By of September 12, almost 100,000 had lost power in Upstate South Carolina.Five people died in storm-related incidents across South Carolina, all from indirect incidents.The tropical storm caused damages totaling $500,000 in the state.\n\nLight damage occurred in other areas, including Tennessee.About 75,000 customers in North Carolina lost power due to Irma.It also caused $600,000 in damages in Alabama.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Irma\'s path through the West Indies and Caribbean, the devastation to roads, harbors and airports significantly impeded the transportation and distribution of relief supplies.Foreign countries moved to provide much of the initial aid.The British, Dutch, French, and United States governments sent warships and planes with supplies and manpower to the region.International leaders, including Dutch King Willem-Alexander and French President Emmanuel Macron, quickly moved to visit affected territories.\n\nSome of the affected countries and territories also offered assistance to each other.Cuba, which sustained extensive damage from the storm, sent 750 health workers to Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, Dominica, and Haiti.Government officials and members of the public in Puerto Rico delivered assistance and evacuated people stranded on other islands.The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services granted special 30-day humanitarian visas for British Virgin Islanders to stay in Puerto Rico.Hundreds of people stranded on Saint Martin were flown to the Dominican Republic on humanitarian grounds.\n\nIn response to Hurricane Jose\'s approach, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a mandatory evacuation on September 9 for any remaining residents on Barbuda.A Miami cargo plane landed on Antigua later that day, carrying over 60 tons (120,000 lbs) of relief supplies for the displaced storm victims—including bottled water, canned food and power generators.\n\nRFA Mounts Bay stationed itself near Anguilla and provided support and relief work to the island with its helicopters and 40 marines and army engineers.The ship delivered 6 tonnes of emergency aid to Anguilla and army engineers repaired a fuel leak at Anguilla\'s main petrol dump, restored power to the island\'s hospital and provided shelters for those left homeless by the hurricane.The ship arrived in the British Virgin Islands on September 8, 2017, to provide emergency relief to the islands, including providing shelters, food and water.HMS Ocean was diverted from the Mediterranean to provide relief from Gibraltar to the affected British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos on September 7, and aid was also supplied by the Department for International Development from their disaster response centre at Kemble Airfield.As part of a £32 million operation named Operation Ruman, nearly 500 UK military personnel with emergency relief were dispatched from RAF Brize Norton.This included the first deployment of No. 38 Expeditionary Air Wing with 3 RAF aircraft; 2 Airbus A400M Atlas and 1 C130J hercules to support relief efforts.\n\nThe British government also drafted 2 members of the UK police calibre into the region on September 10, and 53 police officers were drafted from RAF Brize Norton to the affected British Overseas Territories on September 15 to help maintain order.UK politicians, including the chairs of the foreign affairs and development select committees, criticized both the government\'s preparations for the storm and its response as inadequate.\n\nBy September 12, the Department for International Development had delivered more than 40 tonnes of aid into the region, including into Turks and Caicos, and 1,000 UK military troops were deployed in the region as part of relief efforts.The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, pledged an additional £25 million worth of funding as part of relief efforts in the region on September 13, 2017, and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Boris Johnson, said that a further 250 UK military personnel would be deployed into the area within the next few days.Anguilla\'s Chief Minister, Victor Banks, praised the British government\'s response to the storm and said that Boris Johnson\'s visit to the island ""sends a very positive signal to Anguillans that the British are serious about their response to this very severe hurricane"", but went on to say that the current financial commitment from the UK was not substantial enough.\n\nBy September 15, the United Kingdom had over 70 military personnel and 4 police officers in Anguilla and had delivered 15 tonnes of aid to the island.In the British Virgin Islands, Royal Marines had cleared the airfield so that it was operational for the delivery of aid into the islands, with more than 200 British military personnel and 54 UK police officers on the ground and 8 tonnes of aid delivered to the islands.120 British military personnel were on the ground in Turks and Caicos, and over 150 shelter kits and 720 liters of water were delivered to the islands on September 15.\n\nAmendments to international aid rules by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (or OECD) allowed for the UK government to provide access to £13 billion worth of aid to the affected British Overseas Territories, through the UK\'s Official Development Assistance (ODA) by November 2017.\n\nBy the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage.The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by Irma\'s eye, remained largely inaccessible for days.Assessments showed that 15% of the national telecommunications network had been affected, with at least one tower destroyed.Bahamasair resumed a limited domestic schedule on September 10, with international flights still cancelled due to existing and anticipated destruction at other destinations.\n\nThe worst devastation occurred on Ragged Island, over which Irma\'s eye had directly passed.After days of the National Emergency Management Agency not being able to physically reach the island, officials were finally able to inspect it; they promptly declared it uninhabitable.Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said that it was the worst disaster area he or his officials had ever seen, and that all remaining residents would need to leave, potentially permanently.Business leaders and other officials called for a new long-term development model to shift the population away from such sparsely-settled islands.\n\nOn Grand Bahama and Bimini, where tornadoes associated with Irma touched down on September 10, more than 100 people were left displaced.Infrastructure damage included docks, parks, and the power system.\n\nAside from tangible asset losses, Irma brought significant economic damages.International freight shipping was projected to be offline for a week, and costs for rebuilding supplies were inflated due to demand in the U.S.\n\nSwollen rivers contributed to worsening flooding in the days after the storm system left, resulting in additional evacuations.Officials resorted to using inflatable rafts to access affected areas.The national electrical infrastructure was said to be extensively damaged.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, flooding worsened following Irma\'s departure, leading the number of displaced persons to increase to more than 24,000 by September 8.President Danilo Medina ordered further evacuations due to at-risk dams, while the government banned swimming in rivers and ordered boats kept in port.More than 422,000 people were left without water due to 28 aqueducts being damaged.\n\nIn Haiti, officials stated that losses were greater than they could have been since people largely did not heed early preparation and evacuation warnings.At least 5,000 homes were flooded.One man died trying to cross a flooded river; another went missing and 17 were injured.The trash- and waste-contaminated floodwaters in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives led to fears of cholera outbreaks.Flooding continued to worsen days after the storm, as runoff from the mountains swelled rivers in low-lying farming communities.United Nations peacekeepers from Brazil were able to gain access to the flooded northwest region to provide urgent aid, but non-governmental organizations and Haitian economists warned that the estimated 30,000 victims would need longer-term assistance as well.Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant appointed a government commission to address Irma\'s effects, with Action Against Hunger in charge of humanitarian coordination.\n\nIn the USVI, residents and tourists alike were described as being in a state of traumatic shock.By September 7, the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship had arrived in the USVI to provide supplies, damage assessment, and evacuation assistance.Four additional warships, some of which had already been on their way to Texas to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief, were redirected to the region.At a September 10 news conference, Governor Kenneth Mapp described Irma as a ""horrific disaster"" for which ""[t]here will be no restorations or solutions in days or weeks.""The Federal Emergency Management Agency airlifted in goods for residents, who were subjected to a curfew.Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line agreed to transport tourists to Florida, contingent upon port availability following the state\'s own experience with Irma.\n\nOn Saint John, described as ""perhaps the site of Irma\'s worst devastation on American soil,"" it took six days for an active-theater disaster zone to be established, leading to criticism of the U.S. government response.The National Guard was delayed in reaching Saint John due to the number of overturned boats left in the harbor.The National Guard was brought in to maintain order, while the Coast Guard brought evacuees to cruise ships bound for San Juan and Miami.There was still no electricity on St. John in the middle of October 2017.\n\nBy September 9, more than one million Puerto Ricans were still without power, tens of thousands were without water, and several thousand were still in shelters.Hospitals were operating on generator power.The government was struggling to establish contact with the islands of Culebra and Vieques.By September 10, the main island had recovered enough to serve as a refuge for people stranded on other islands, including 1,200 tourists from Saint Martin and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Airlifts had brought more than 50 patients to Puerto Rico.\n\nFive months after Irma, two-thirds of the hospital beds on Saint Thomas were still unavailable, due to extensive physical damage and staffing shortages.\n\nDamage to Sint Maarten\'s harbour and to Princess Juliana International Airport left the Dutch part of Saint Martin unreachable, although the smaller Grand Case-Espérance Airport on the French side could be reopened by September 7 for supply aid by helicopter and airplane.The French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops on board a CASA/IPTN CN-235 aircraft.\n\nThe following day, the Dutch military was able to airlift dialysis patients off the island while also dropping leaflets to warn islanders about the rapidly approaching Hurricane Jose.Although the airport was closed, 435 students and faculty of the American University of the Caribbean were evacuated by the U.S. military.On September 10, Dutch King Willem-Alexander departed for the region, with intentions to visit Sint Maarten and other affected Dutch territories and commonwealth members.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron followed this announcement by stating his intentions to visit the French part of the island on September 12 in order to bring aid supplies.In response to criticism of the French handling of the disaster, 1,000 troops, police, and other emergency workers were sent to Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.\n\nOn both sides of Saint Martin, desperate conditions combined with food and water shortages in Irma\'s aftermath led to reports of violence, scavenging, and theft.In response, the French government increased its troop deployment to 2,200 and the Dutch government sent more than 600 military and police personnel.\n\nThe day after the hurricane hit Saint Barthelemy the French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops into the reopened Grand Case-Espérance Airport.On September 7 and 9, equipment and personnel were flown from France to Guadeloupe and Martinique.\n\nSporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm.\n\nOn September 11, Florida Governor Rick Scott conducted an aerial tour to survey the damage to the Keys.The Overseas Highway remained closed while authorities assessed the integrity of the 42 bridges along the route.Residents returning to the Keys were faced with a police roadblock, to the south of Florida City.USS Iwo Jima, USS New York and aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were sent to the Keys area to aid with the recovery.\n\nOn September 12, some residents were allowed to return into the Keys as far as Islamorada.Although road damage blocked entry any farther than Islamorada, bridges had been inspected and found safe to Sugarloaf Key.By late on September 12, the Overseas Highway had been repaired and the bridges inspected as safe for first responders to travel to Key West.On September 16, residents were free to return to Marathon.Residents were allowed to return to Key West the following day, although the Keys remained closed to tourists and a checkpoint remained in place in Florida City.\n\nDue mainly to the widespread loss of power, cell phone service was also reduced after battery backup power for cell phone towers ran out and backup generators ran out of fuel.In an impact report by the FCC, as of 11 AM EDT on September 12, 89 of 108 (82%) cell phone towers were non-functioning in Monroe County (Florida Keys), 154 of 212 (73%) were non-functioning in Collier County (Naples), 36 of 46 (78%) were non-functioning in Hendry County, and an additional six counties had 41-60% of cell phone towers not functioning, including Lee County (Fort Myers) and Miami-Dade County.\n\nNOAA released map-format aerial reconnaissance image data of damage from the storm.The imagery featured several areas of Florida: including the Florida Keys, the southwest coast of Florida from Marco Island to Punta Gorda, much of the northeast coast of Florida, and portions of the Jacksonville area.Portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts were also photographed.Additionally, the Sun-Sentinel published before and after photos of several landmarks in the Florida Keys.\n\nIn the days after the hurricane, due to the heavy rainfall, numerous rivers had flooded, including residential areas.Public health risks, such as diarrheal infections and mosquito-borne illnesses, remain from the flooding that resulted in the aftermath of the hurricane.A large concern from flooding is contamination because people become exposed to dirty floodwaters and the potential for contaminated water to enter the local water supply is significant.One example of an illness that can enter the water supply is leptospirosis, which is rat urine carries into the floodwaters.Untreated exposure to leptospirosis can cause kidney damage, meningitis, and liver failure.Noroviruses and other infections are also a risk.\n\nFollowing Irma\'s passage, a hand-carved wooden canoe was discovered on the banks of the Indian River and could be several hundred years old.The state has removed the canoe for examination and safe keeping.\n\nDue to Irma\'s and Hurricane Harvey\'s impact in Florida and Texas, U.S. employment declined in September 2017 for the first time since September 2010.The leisure and hospitality industries were especially hard hit, losing 111,000 jobs in September.\n\nIrma set multiple records for intensity, especially at easterly longitudes, time spent at such an intensity, and its intensity at landfall.When Irma reached Category 5 intensity with winds of at 11:45 UTC on September 5 at 57.7°W, it became the easternmost Atlantic hurricane of this strength on record, surpassing Hurricane David of 1979, later beaten by Hurricane Lorenzo 2 years later.By 00:15 UTC on September 6, Irma reached peak intensity with () winds and a minimum pressure of .This ties it with Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and Hurricane Rita of 2005 as the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed.Only five other Atlantic hurricanes have been recorded with wind speeds higher than Irma: Hurricane Allen of 1980, which had maximum sustained winds of , and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Gilbert of 1988, Hurricane Wilma of 2005, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, all of which had peak winds of .At the time, Irma was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; later surpassed by Hurricane Dorian, and was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007.In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category 5 strength winds, and the third-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, with a value of 64.9 units.Only the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane and Hurricane Ivan in 2004 achieved higher values.\n\nOn September 6, Irma made landfall on the islands of Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Virgin Gorda at peak strength.This ties Irma with cyclones Monica of 2006 and Winston of 2016, and typhoons Zeb of 1998 and Megi of 2010 as the seventh-strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall globally – in terms of sustained winds – trailing only Typhoon Goni of 2020 which bore winds of at landfall, Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 and Typhoon Meranti of 2016, which bore winds of at landfall, and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Typhoon Joan of 1959, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, which bore winds of at landfall.Irma is second to the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin, and is the first hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic at Category 5 status since Felix in 2007.Irma is the first recorded Category 5 hurricane to affect the northern Leeward Islands, and was one of the worst storms to hit the region on record, along with Hurricane Donna in 1960 and Hurricane Luis in 1995.In addition, Irma is only the second hurricane on record to make landfall in Cuba at Category 5 intensity, with the other being a hurricane in 1924.Furthermore, when Irma made landfall on Barbuda, Saint Martin, Virgin Gorda, and Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane, it became one of only two recorded Atlantic storms to make landfall in multiple nations at this strength; the other was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which struck both Eleuthera and the United States as a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nIrma made landfall in the Florida Keys with winds of and a pressure of , making it the strongest hurricane to strike Florida in terms of wind speed since Charley in 2004, and the most intense to strike the state in terms of barometric pressure since Andrew in 1992.In the span of two weeks, two Category 4 hurricanes—Harvey and Irma—struck the continental United States, the first time on record two Atlantic tropical cyclones of such strength made landfall on the country in the same hurricane season.This also marked only the third occurrence of two consecutive Atlantic storms making landfall in the United States as major hurricanes.The other two instances were the Great Charleston and Cheniere Caminada hurricanes in 1893, and hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne in 2004.\n\nBecause of the extensive damage and loss of life the hurricane caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Irma from its rotating naming lists in April 2018, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane.It was replaced with Idalia for the 2023 season.\n\nWeather of 2017 Tropical cyclones in 2017 List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes Operation RUMAN – UK military-civil disaster relief response to Hurricane Irma.List of Cuba hurricanes List

44,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Hurricane Irma', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'Hurricane Irma was an extremely powerful Cape Verde hurricane that caused widespread destruction across its path in early September 2017.Irma was the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the Leeward Islands on record, followed by Maria two weeks later.At the time, it was considered the most powerful hurricane on record in the open Atlantic region, outside of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, until it was surpassed by Hurricane Dorian two years later.It was also the third-strongest Atlantic hurricane at landfall ever recorded, just behind the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane and Dorian.The ninth named storm, fourth hurricane, second major hurricane, and first Category 5 hurricane of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Irma caused widespread and catastrophic damage throughout its long lifetime, particularly in the northeastern Caribbean and the Florida Keys.It was also the most intense hurricane to strike the continental United States since Katrina in 2005, the first major hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Wilma in the same year, and the first Category 4 hurricane to strike the state since Charley in 2004.The word Irmageddon was coined soon after the hurricane to describe the damage caused by the hurricane.\n\nIrma developed from a tropical wave near the Cape Verde Islands on August 30.Favorable conditions allowed Irma to rapidly intensify into a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson wind scale by late on August 31.The storm\'s intensity fluctuated between Categories 2 and 3 for the next several days, due to a series of eyewall replacement cycles.On September 4, Irma resumed intensifying, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by early on the next day.Early on September 6, Irma peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of and a minimum pressure of .Irma was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017 in terms of barometric pressure, and the strongest worldwide in 2017 in terms of wind speed.Another eyewall replacement cycle caused Irma to weaken back to a Category 4 hurricane, but the storm re-attained Category 5 status before making landfall in Cuba.Although Irma briefly weakened to a Category 2 storm while making landfall on Cuba, the system re-intensified to Category 4 status as it crossed the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, before making landfall on Cudjoe Key on September 10.Irma then weakened to Category 3 status, prior to another landfall in Florida on Marco Island later that day.The system degraded into a remnant low over Alabama and ultimately dissipated on September 13 over Missouri.\n\nThe storm caused catastrophic damage in Barbuda, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Anguilla, and the Virgin Islands as a Category 5 hurricane.The hurricane caused at least 134 deaths: one in Anguilla; one in Barbados; three in Barbuda; four in the British Virgin Islands; 10 in Cuba; 11 in the French West Indies; one in Haiti; three in Puerto Rico; four on the Dutch side of Sint Maarten; 92 in the contiguous United States, and four in the U.S. Virgin Islands.Hurricane Irma was the top Google searched term in the U.S. and globally in 2017.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa on August 26.The tropical wave moved off the coast of the continent late on August 27.Throughout the next two days, showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low-pressure area, as the system passed just south of and then through the Cape Verde Islands on August 29.Around 00:00 UTC on the following day, the system developed into a tropical depression just west of the Cape Verde Islands.Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Irma, based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates.With warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, strengthening was anticipated, with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier air.\n\nThe nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow, as an anticyclone became established over the system, with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images.Early on August 31, shortly after the development of a central dense overcast (CDO) and an eye feature, Irma underwent rapid intensification, becoming a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 UTC and then a Category 3 hurricane, becoming a major hurricane – around 00:00 UTC on September 1.Within a 48-hour period, the hurricane\'s intensity had increased by .On September 2, a ship passed to the west of the center of Irma, recording maximum winds of , which indicated that the eye of Irma remained compact.A strong high pressure system to the north of Irma caused the storm to move west-southwestward between September 2 and September 4.The first aircraft reconnaissance mission departed from Barbados on the afternoon of September 3, discovering an eye in diameter and surface winds of .\n\nOn September 4, after moving into more favorable conditions, Irma strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane.As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by 12:00 UTC on the following day, with winds of .The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at near 18:00 UTC on September 5. Irma acquired annular characteristics around this time, with the storm exhibiting a large, symmetric CDO and an impressive satellite appearance.Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern Leeward Islands.Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of Barbuda at peak intensity, with the storm\'s central minimum pressure having bottomed out at – this was the lowest in the Atlantic since Dean in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of .Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15 UTC on Sint Maarten, and at 16:30 UTC on Virgin Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands, though the storm\'s central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall.\n\nAs the hurricane moved away from the Virgin Islands late on September 6, observations from reconnaissance flights, as well as Doppler radar in San Juan, Puerto Rico, indicated an elliptical eye and double eyewalls.Late on September 6, the cyclone passed about north of Puerto Rico.Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of Hispaniola throughout the day on September 7.After beginning an eyewall replacement cycle, Irma weakened to a Category 4 hurricane as it passed south of the Turks and Caicos Islands early on September 8.This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category 5 intensity, the second-longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above – behind only the 1932 Cuba hurricane.At 05:00 UTC on September 8, Irma made landfall on the island of Little Inagua in the Bahamas with sustained winds of .The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a subtropical ridge to its north.Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category 5 intensity at 18:00 UTC that day east of Cuba as deep convection became more pronounced and organized.The hurricane then made landfall in Cayo Romano, Cuba, at 03:00 UTC on September 9, with winds of .This made Irma only the second Category 5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the 1924 Cuba hurricane.As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category 2 storm later on September 9.\n\nAfter slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards Florida around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental United States.Moving over the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, Irma quickly restrengthened to a Category 4 hurricane at 06:00 UTC on September 10, as deep convection improved and the eye became better defined.In addition, Irma\'s wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of and gale-force winds spanning in diameter.The cyclone made landfall in Cudjoe Key, Florida, at 13:00 UTC on September 10, at Category 4 intensity, with winds of .Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category 3 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30 UTC, in Marco Island, Florida, with sustained winds of .Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category 3 intensity hours after landfall.Passing east of Tampa as a weakening Category 1 hurricane around 06:00 UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation – though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds.The system finally weakened to a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC that day as it entered southern Georgia, while acquiring some extratropical characteristics.At 06:00 UTC on September 12, Irma degenerated to a remnant low just as it entered Alabama, as most of the deep convection had diminished.The remnants persisted for another day or so before dissipating over Missouri on September 13.\n\nGiven that Irma\'s forecast track was along much of the Caribbean island chain, hurricane warnings were issued for the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and parts of Hispaniola on September 5.\n\nIn Antigua and Barbuda, residents safeguarded their homes and cleaned up their properties in anticipation of strong winds.Emergency crews were put on standby at public shelters and hospitals by September 5 to assist with any evacuations.Expecting a direct hit, more than half of the residents on Barbuda took shelter, and relief supplies were preemptively mobilized.The National Emergency Management Organization on Saint Lucia urged small craft operators and swimmers to be mindful of forecasts for high surf.Small Craft Warnings and High Surf Advisories were hoisted for Dominica, where residents were urged to remain vigilant of the potential for high waves, landslides, and flooding.\n\nIn Guadeloupe, low-lying and cliff-edge homes were evacuated at the threat of flooding and erosion.Schools and public businesses closed on September 5 and 6.Hospitals stocked up on three days\' worth of supplies and checked the functionality of their generators.Of the island\'s 32 communes, 22 activated their emergency plans; 1,500 people were urged to take shelter.The island sustained relatively minor damage and became the base for relief efforts on Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.Though the core of the hurricane was expected to remain north of the island, a yellow alert was issued for Martinique due to the likelihood of rough seas.The island dispatched relief supplies and military reinforcements to its neighboring islands of Guadeloupe, Saint Martin.and Saint Barthélemy, which faced a greater risk of a direct impact.\n\nOn September 4, Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency.By September 6, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency had deployed response teams in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.Supplies, including food rations, medical supplies, and blankets, were pre-staged in strategic locations on the islands for distribution.\n\nOn September 5, the Dominican Republic activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage; the United States and Haiti followed suit two days later.According to officials, 11,200 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas prior to the storm\'s arrival.Approximately 7,400 tourists were moved to Santo Domingo, away from beach resorts.In Haiti, government officials and aid organizations struggled with early preparation and evacuation efforts.While some officials blamed reluctance and indifference on the part of the population, others ""admitted they were not prepared for the onslaught and no mandatory evacuation orders were in place ahead of Irma\'s approach.""Local officials contended that they had not received promised funds, supplies, or equipment from the national government.The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti prepared its 1,000 peacekeepers and engineers to assist.\n\nIn the Turks and Caicos, evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas starting September 5. Schools were closed, government buildings were boarded up, and shelters were opened.Officials spread warnings to residents in English, Creole, and Spanish via social media, radio, SMS text, and WhatsApp.In The Bahamas, the government began preparations the week prior to the hurricane\'s arrival, including securing national sports facilities to use as shelters.By September 7, the government had evacuated 1,609 people by air from the southern islands, including 365 from Bimini.Controlled cutting of the power supply to southern and central Bahamian islands was conducted in advance of the storm.Shelters were made available, though usage was low due to most evacuees staying with family on other islands.Of the 2,679 foreign tourists still in The Bahamas on September 7, about 1,200 were being housed at Atlantis Paradise Island, one of the most hurricane-ready structures in the country.\n\nIn Cuba, meteorologists did not initially predict a direct hit.Fuel conservation was enacted in Camagüey Province to ensure that enough would be available during post-storm power outages.The Civil Defense evacuated nearly one million people from low-lying areas, including thousands of Canadian and European tourists in the Jardines del Rey.Dolphins at a Cayo Guillermo resort were evacuated by helicopter.\n\nThe NHC issued several watches and warnings for the Southeastern United States.The first watches and warnings were issued at 15:00 UTC on September 7, which was a hurricane watch from the Jupiter Inlet to Bonita Beach, including the Florida Keys and Lake Okeechobee.The watches and warnings were extended into Georgia and South Carolina on September 9.At 21:00 UTC on that day, the advisories reached their maximum extent, with a hurricane warning covering the entire east coast of the state, the west coast from Indian Pass southward, and the Florida Keys; a hurricane watch was in place from the Florida–Georgia state line to Edisto Beach, South Carolina; and there were two tropical storm warnings, one in Florida from Indian Pass to the Okaloosa–Walton county line and the other from the Florida–Georgia state line to the South Santee River in South Carolina.Watches and warnings were gradually discontinued as Irma moved inland and weakened, with all of them canceled by early on September 12.\n\nOn September 4, Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency.Governor Scott placed 100 members of the Florida National Guard on duty to assist in preparations.All 7,000 troops were ordered to be on duty by September 8.Officials advised residents to stock their hurricane kits.The state coordinated with electrical companies in order for power outages to be restored as quickly as possible, extending resources such as equipment, fuel, and lodging for the approximately 24,000 restoration personnel who had been activated.Governor Scott suspended tolls on all toll roads in Florida, including the turnpike.All state offices in Florida were closed from September 8 to September 11, while public schools, state colleges, and state universities in all 67 counties were closed during the same period.The Florida Department of Education coordinated with school districts as the need for transportation by school buses and opening shelters arose.By September 9, more than 150 state parks were closed.Throughout the state, almost 700 emergency shelters were opened.The shelters collectively housed about 191,764 people, with more than 40% of them staying in a shelter in South Florida.Additionally, more than 60 special needs shelters were opened, which housed more than 5,000 people by September 9.\n\nMany airports across the state, particularly in Central and South Florida, were closed.Nearly 9,000 flights intending to arrive in or depart from Florida were canceled.Along Florida\'s coasts, most seaports were closed or opened with restricted access.For the fifth time in its 45-year history, the Walt Disney World Resort was completely closed due to the storm.Its theme parks, water parks, and Disney Springs were all closed by 9:00 p.m. on September 9 and remained closed until September 12.Other Orlando-area theme parks, including Universal Orlando Resort and SeaWorld Orlando, were also closed.The Kennedy Space Center was closed from September 8 to September 15.\n\nAn estimated 6.5 million Floridians were ordered to evacuate, mostly those living on barrier islands or in coastal areas; in mobile or sub-standard homes; and in low-lying or flood prone areas.Mandatory evacuations were ordered for portions of Brevard, Broward, Citrus, Collier, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Glades, Hendry, Hernando, Indian River, Lee, Martin, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Lucie, Sumter, and Volusia counties.All of Monroe County, where the Florida Keys are located, was placed under a mandatory evacuation.Residents in communities near the southern half of Lake Okeechobee were also ordered to leave.Additionally, voluntary evacuation notices were issued for all or parts of Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Charlotte, Columbia, Desoto, Hardee, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lake, Manatee, Okeechobee, Osceola, and Polk counties.\n\nA record 6.5 million Floridians evacuated, making it the largest evacuation in the state\'s history.Evacuees caused significant traffic congestion on northbound Interstate 95, Interstate 75, and Florida\'s Turnpike, exacerbated by the fact that the entire Florida peninsula was within the cone of uncertainty in the NHC\'s forecast path in the days before the storm, so evacuees from both coasts headed north, as evacuees would not be safer by fleeing to the opposite coast.Fuel was in short supply throughout peninsular Florida during the week before Irma\'s arrival, especially along evacuation routes, leading to hours-long lines at fuel stations and even escorts of fuel trucks by the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nUse of the left shoulder as a lane for moving traffic was allowed on northbound Interstate 75 from Wildwood to the Georgia state line beginning September 8 and on eastbound Interstate 4 from Tampa to State Road 429 near Celebration for a few hours on September 9.It was the first time that the shoulder-use plan, which was introduced at the start of the 2017 hurricane season, was implemented by the state for hurricane evacuations.The shoulder-use plan was implemented in place of labor- and resource-intensive contraflow lane reversal, in which both sides of an interstate highway are used for one direction of traffic.\n\nOfficials from the Environmental Protection Agency, which had been criticized for its response to Hurricane Harvey, took special measures to inspect and secure hazardous materials, especially at Superfund sites.Direct Relief, a disaster relief organization, coordinated with local health centers and provided resources to help facilities on the front lines of Floridian and Puerto Rican communities.\n\nGeorgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency initially for all six coastal counties on September 6, but eventually expanded the declaration to 94 counties south of Atlanta metropolitan area, and then the entire state on September 10.Atlanta was placed under its first-ever tropical storm warning.Governor Deal ordered mandatory evacuations for all areas east of Interstate 95 on September 7, before extending the order to the entirety of Chatham County and low-lying areas west of I-95 on the following day.In total, 540,000 people on the Georgia coast were ordered to leave.Contraflow lane reversal for Interstate 16 took effect on the morning of September 9 from Savannah to Dublin, Georgia.All Georgia state parks were open for free to evacuees, as was the 800-acre camping area at Atlanta Motor Speedway.Reversible HOT lanes on Interstate 75 in Georgia through south metro Atlanta were open 24 hours northbound with no tolls.\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on September 6, with South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster following suit the same day.Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency on September 8 in order to protect Virginia residents and to mobilize resources in support of neighboring states.Officials in New Orleans stated that there would not be much time for preparations if Irma failed to make the projected northward turn, but that South Texas or Florida would not be a good evacuation destination.On September 10, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam issued an executive order allowing medical professionals in other states to practice in Tennessee to aid Hurricane Irma evacuees.This order also allowed pharmacies to give out 14-day supplies of medicine, and gave women and children from outside the state the ability to participate in the Tennessee Department of Health programs.Bristol Motor Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway, and Charlotte Motor Speedway all opened their campgrounds to evacuees free of charge.\n\nIn professional sports, the Miami Dolphins–Tampa Bay Buccaneers game scheduled for September 10 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was postponed to November 19 due to the storm\'s threat.The Dolphins left early for their road game against the Los Angeles Chargers.The Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees moved their September 11–13 series from Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg to Citi Field in Queens.Minor League Baseball\'s Florida State League, Carolina League, and Southern League called off their championship finals and as a result, named their division series winners league co-champions.The Miami FC versus San Francisco Deltas match on September 10 was cancelled so the players and staff could prepare for the storm with their families.The Orlando Pride of the National Women\'s Soccer League rescheduled their September 9 match to September 7. Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer did not have any scheduled home games in September, but was unable to return to training facilities in Orlando due to Hurricane Irma.\n\nIn college football, the UCF Knights-Memphis Tigers game scheduled for September 9 was moved to September 30, replacing UCF\'s game against Maine and Memphis game against Georgia State.UCF also cancelled their game against Georgia Tech on September 16, as UCF\'s stadium hosted the National Guard.The USF Bulls-Connecticut Huskies football game was also cancelled.The Miami Hurricanes–Arkansas State Redwolves game scheduled for September 9 at Centennial Bank Stadium in Arkansas was canceled due to travel concerns for the University of Miami.The Florida Gators-Northern Colorado Bears match in Gainesville scheduled for September 9 was cancelled.The Florida State Seminoles contest against the Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks was canceled on September 8.The Seminoles\' rivalry game with the Hurricanes in Tallahassee, originally scheduled for September 16, was postponed tp October 7.The FIU Panthers game against the Alcorn State Braves was moved up a day and relocated to Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.The Georgia Southern Eagles game against the New Hampshire Wildcats on September 9 was also moved to Legion Field for that day.\n\nAs of September 5, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding was running dangerously low, due to its response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas the previous week, prompting the Trump administration to request an immediate $8 billion in additional funding as Irma approached Florida.Given the rate that current funds are being consumed and the catastrophic damage, the United States Senate almost doubled the requested amount to $15.3 billion, with the understanding that this would only be about 10% of what will be required for responding to Harvey.\n\nHurricane Irma\'s path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating, with landfalls in Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Martin, the Bahamas, Cuba, and the United States, all at major hurricane intensity.Furthermore, the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences.Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria.\n\nThe eyewall of the hurricane moved over Barbuda near its record peak intensity early on September 6; a weather station observed a wind gust of .The same station also recorded a minimum barometric pressure of .The exact state of the island remained unclear for hours after Irma\'s passage, as downed phone lines ceased all communication with nearby islands.Later that afternoon, Prime Minister Gaston Browne surveyed the territory by helicopter, revealing an effectively uninhabitable island.Irma damaged or destroyed 95% of the structures on Barbuda, including its hospital, schools, and both of its hotels; it completely flattened some residential blocks while submerging others.The destruction rendered the island\'s sole airport and much of its infrastructure inoperative—including water and telecommunication services—which further hampered relief efforts.Property damage on Barbuda ranged from $150 million to $300 million.A total of three storm-related deaths were reported on the island.\n\nIn addition to the catastrophic impact on Barbuda\'s human residents, concern turned to the storm\'s effects on the island\'s wildlife.The island\'s only endemic bird, the near-threatened Barbuda warbler, numbered less than 2,000 individuals prior to the hurricane.For some time it was unknown if the warbler survived the hurricane or its aftermath; however within a few months it was confirmed that not only did the species survive, but the most of the birds survived the storm.Barbuda\'s Codrington Lagoon, home to the largest colony of magnificent frigatebirds in the Caribbean, with an estimated 2,500 nesting pairs, was also inundated by the storm surge.\n\nRemaining just outside of Irma\'s strongest windfield, Antigua sustained less severe damage, in the form of leveled roofs and fences, downed power poles and lines, and uprooted trees.Some street flooding also took place in low-lying areas.Three people were treated for minor storm-related injuries.Forensic disaster analysts from the Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM), a Germany-based risk management agency, estimate that economic losses for Antigua and Barbuda will exceed $120 million.\n\nOn the morning of September 6, Irma\'s center crossed the island of Saint Martin while the storm was at peak intensity, sweeping away entire structures, submerging roads and cars, and triggering an island-wide blackout.Irma\'s extreme winds ripped trees out of the ground and sent vehicles and debris from damaged structures scattered across the territory.On the French side of Saint-Martin, entire marinas around Marigot were left in ruins, littered with the stranded remnants of boats that had smashed into each other.A hotel caught on fire, but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze.Another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor.Media images depicted devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds had shattered their windows.Irma killed four people on the French side of the island and injured 50 others, one of whom was in critical condition.As many as 95% of the buildings there were damaged to some degree; 60% of those were totally uninhabitable.Estimates from CEDIM indicate a minimum of $950 million worth of economic losses.Total losses exceeded €3.5 billion (US$4.17 billion).\n\nA similar situation unfolded in Sint Maarten, Saint Martin\'s Dutch half, as intense winds ripped through buildings and lifted vehicles aloft ""as if they were matches"".The hurricane wreaked havoc on Princess Juliana International Airport, with ""huge chunks of the building [strewn] across the runway and a jet bridge snapped in half.""It demolished or severely damaged about 70% of Sint Maarten\'s houses, forcing thousands of residents into public shelters.There were 4 deaths and 23 injuries, 11 of which were serious, in the Dutch territory.Irma is considered the worst natural disaster to hit Sint Maarten; the extent of its damage far exceeded that of any previous hurricane.Total damages were estimated at €2.5 billion (US$2.98 billion).\n\nIrma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the French island of Saint Barthélemy, southeast of Saint Martin.Describing the extent of the destruction, one local compared it to ""a bomb that burned all vegetation,"" while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively ""erased the island from the map"".Violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments, with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation.Streets in the capital of Gustavia were turned into rushing rivers, which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture.The island\'s fire station was inundated with up to of flood waters.With scores of homes and much of the infrastructure destroyed, the majority of the island\'s population was left stranded and without water, electricity or phone service.The associated economic losses could exceed $480 million according to CEDIM\'s analysts.\n\nPreliminary assessments from the French government indicate that Hurricane Irma caused a combined €1.2 billion (US$1.43 billion) in insured losses across the French territories of Saint-Martin and Saint Barts.This total covered private property such as homes, vehicles and businesses (including lost revenue); the extent of the damage to infrastructural and public facilities remains undetermined.Nonetheless, this made Irma one of the costliest natural disasters to hit the French Republic in 50 years.\n\nOn January 30, 2018, roughly five months after Irma, an analysis was published indicating that an anemometer on the island recorded an unofficial gust to before failing.\n\nThe British Overseas Territory of Anguilla saw the eyewall of the storm pass over it on September 6.Many homes and schools were destroyed, and the island\'s only hospital was badly damaged.The devastation was particularly severe in East End, where the winds uprooted scores of trees and power poles and demolished a number of houses.In The Valley, the island\'s capital, the hurricane blew out the windows of government buildings.Rough seas inflicted heavy damage upon several bays and harbors, and a seaside restaurant was completely eradicated.About 90% of roads were left impassable.The island\'s air traffic control tower was damaged, exacerbating the already poor communication with the island.One death was reported on the island.Estimates of losses on the island total at least $190 million.\n\nLarge swells ahead of Irma washed ashore debris and sea life in Castries, Saint Lucia, blocking some roads.Seaside roads were inundated with water.One surfer was killed amid rough surf in Barbados after hitting a reef and breaking his neck.Trees were also destroyed.The hurricane\'s effects, such as violent seas and rattling trees, were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in Guadeloupe.Several houses were damaged.Around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm, leaving several communes in the dark without running water.Overall damage was limited to external parts of houses and trees that were blown onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seas.\n\nSaint Kitts and Nevis endured similar conditions to other islands.Blustery rainstorms triggered scattered power outages and disabled the island\'s water system, but per the International Red Cross, the islands were spared the level of destruction seen elsewhere.Still, Prime Minister Timothy Harris stated that property and infrastructure had sustained ""significant damage.""The Dutch territories of Saba and Sint Eustatius were also struck by the hurricane\'s winds, resulting in infrastructural damage, water shortages and telecommunication outages.Several houses were left uninhabitable.On Saba, the hurricane also defoliated trees and injured a few people.CEDIM\'s analysts expect economic losses of $20–65 million for the two islands.\n\nDamage in the British Virgin Islands was extensive.Numerous buildings and roads were destroyed on the island of Tortola, which bore the brunt of the hurricane\'s core.Four people were confirmed dead.Along Cane Garden Bay, the storm surge submerged several seaside bars and a gas station.Satellite images revealed many of the island\'s residential zones had been left in ruins.The hurricane passed over Necker Island, also causing severe damage and destroying the mansion of Richard Branson.\n\nMost homes and businesses were destroyed on the island of Jost Van Dyke, the smallest of the B.V.I.\'s four main islands.The Governor, Gus Jaspert, who had only been sworn into office 13 days previously, declared a state of emergency - the first time this has ever happened in the Territory.After the storm, restoration of electricity took approximately 5 months.\n\nIrma\'s effects in the U.S. Virgin Islands were most profound on Saint Thomas, where at least of rain fell, and on Saint John.Saint Thomas island suffered widespread structural damage, including to its police station and airport.Patients from the fourth and third floors of Charlotte Amalie\'s hospital had to be relocated to lower floors due to flooding from roof leaks.Three deaths were attributed to Irma on the island.On nearby Saint Croix, there were communication issues and some damage to the infrastructure.Saint John lost access to ferry and cargo services, along with access to the local airport.Due to its normal reliance on electricity from Saint Thomas, the island was left without power.Total damage from the three islands was at least $1.1 billion.\n\nThe hurricane passed north of Puerto Rico, but still caused significant damage to the United States territory.Along the coast, a tide gauge observed waves up to mean higher high water.Much of the main island experienced sustained tropical storm force winds, with a peak sustained wind speed of at a weather station along San Juan Bay, while the same site observed a peak wind gust of .However, on the island of Culebra, a wind gust of was reported.Mainly due to strong winds, approximately 1.1 million out of 1.5 million of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority\'s customers lost electricity.Portions of Puerto Rico received heavy rainfall, with a peak total of in Bayamón, causing seven rivers to reach flood stage, widespread flash flooding, and at least six landslides.\n\nThe most severely affected areas included the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques, as well as the northeastern, northern, and mountainous portions of the main island.On Culebra, the island suffered an almost complete loss of electrical and water services.At least 30 homes on the island were destroyed, while about 30 other experienced substantial damage.High winds also toppled a number of trees.The only telecommunications tower on Culebra sustained damage, cutting off outside communications for several hours.In rural Loíza, 79 homes were destroyed.Throughout Puerto Rico, 781 out of 1,600 telecommunications towers went out of commission, primarily due to power outages.At least 362,000 customers lost water services.Debris, mostly fallen trees, blocked at least 72 roads.Approximately 25% to 30% of banana, coffee, papaya, and plantain crops were damaged by strong winds, with losses to farmers estimated at $30.6 million.Approximately 1,530 homes experienced at least moderate damage, with 1,448 homes moderately damaged, 32 extensively damaged, and 50 completely destroyed.\n\nHurricane Irma was attributed to around $1 billion in damage, and the NHC attributed three fatalities to Irma in Puerto Rico, though four deaths were related to the storm.Two people died due to rainstorms ahead of the hurricane: one man died in Orocovis after falling off his ladder while repairing his roof; another man on the coast in Capitanejo died after being struck by lightning.Three nearby fishermen were burned by the same lightning strike, but survived.Two other people died during the hurricane: a woman died while being evacuated from her house in a wheelchair and fell, hitting her head; another person died in a car accident in Canóvanas.Governor Ricardo Rosselló declared the islands of Culebra and Vieques to be disaster areas.\n\nAlthough spared a direct hit, both the Dominican Republic and Haiti were affected by high winds and heavy rains.A bridge over the Dajabón River connecting the two countries was broken.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, the fishing community of Nagua sustained damage from waves that destroyed homes.55,000 soldiers were deployed to affected areas to help with the clean-up efforts.By the evening of September 7, the government had counted 2,721 damaged homes.\n\nIn Haiti, flooding one meter deep sat in residential neighborhoods in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives.Mudslides, destroyed homes, flooded crops, and infrastructure damage were reported in the northern part of the country.The total expanse of the flooding stretched from Môle-Saint-Nicolas in the west to the eastern border with the Dominican Republic.\n\nOn the evening of September 7, at 7:30 pm AST (23:30 UTC), Hurricane Irma reached the Turks and Caicos Islands.While the eye passed just south of the main islands, crossing over South Caicos and the Ambergris Cays, the most powerful winds on the northern side of the eye swept all of the islands for more than two hours.Communications infrastructure was destroyed.\n\nOn September 8, Minister of Infrastructure Goldray Ewing confirmed that damage to Providenciales was extensive, with the northwestern neighborhood of Blue Hill being ""gone"".The hospital in the capital, Cockburn Town, was heavily damaged.On South Caicos, 75% of roofs were lost.Total damage was estimated at over $500 million.\n\nIn the Bahamas, the eye of the storm passed over Duncan Town, the major settlement of the Ragged Islands chain, on September 8.It also passed ""almost directly over"" Inagua and South Acklins, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.\n\nDamages were largely confined to the southern islands starting the morning of September 8.On Mayaguana and Great Inagua, downed power lines knocked out communications.On Great Inagua, 70% of homes sustained roof damage, and the island\'s school lost its roof entirely.The Morton Salt Company\'s signature production facility, one of the major employers in the country, experienced millions of dollars in damages.The Acklins settlement of Salina Point was cut off from the rest of the island by flooding, while Crooked Island had widespread roof damage.In the northern Bahamas, the worst property damage came on September 10 as the outer bands of the system produced tornadic activity on Grand Bahama and Bimini.Damage and losses across The Bahamas amounted to $135 million.\n\nWhile Irma was making landfall in Florida, the ocean was drawn away from some western shorelines of the Bahamas due to strong easterly winds.\n\nEarly on September 9, Irma made landfall on the Camagüey Archipelago off the northern coast of Cuba, with sustained winds of .The strongest official sustained wind speed was , while the highest wind gust reached ; both were observed near Camila in Ciego de Ávila Province.The weather station at Esmeralda, Camagüey, was damaged, with the wind gauge destroyed.The north coast of Cuba experienced significant coastal flooding due to storm surge and abnormally high tides generated by the storm.Wave heights at Cayo Romano exceeded .Storm surge penetrated as far as inland in some areas of Villa Clara Province.Multiple locations on the island observed at least of rainfall, with a peak total of of precipitation at Topes de Collantes.\n\nA total of 158,554 homes experienced some degree of damage, of which 14,657 were destroyed; approximately 1.9 million people experienced the direct effects of Irma.The storm partially deroofed 103,691 homes, while 23,560 were completely deroofed.Irma damaged or destroyed 980 health facilities and 2,264 schools.Approximately 3.1 million people experienced disruptions to the water supply, while 246,707 people lost telephone service.About of roads were damaged.Crops also suffered extensively, with nearly affected by the storm.Throughout the country, the hurricane inflicted $13.185 billion in damage and killed 10 people, making Irma the costliest tropical cyclone in Cuban history.\n\nThe tourist areas of Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and Cayo Santa María and the nearby town of Caibarién received the brunt of the storm, with waves rolling through town and the characteristic one-story homes completely flooded.The storm most severely Ciego de Ávila and Villa Clara provinces.Flooding worsened as the hurricane moved west, pushing the storm surge along to the regions around Havana.By the afternoon, limited flooding was occurring in Havana, including around the Malecón.Portions of province coastal flooding surpassing that which was experienced during the Storm of the Century in 1993 and Hurricane Wilma in 2005.In the city of Santa Clara, 39 buildings collapsed.Rainfall resulted in several rivers reaching major flood stage.The town of Cabaiguán in Sancti Spíritus Province in particular suffered extensive inland flooding after the Zaza River swelled.\n\nHurricane Irma directly affected a major colony of American flamingos on Cuba\'s northern Cayo Coco.Early reports from Diario de Cuba indicated that several hundred flamingos had been killed by the storm, though other estimates ranged as high as several thousand birds.\n\nHurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida.Except for the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned.Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba, but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys.The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States.After surveying the aftermath of Irma, Florida governor Rick Scott said ""I thought we would see more damage""[on the mainland] but said ""he witnessed devastation in the Keys"".President Donald Trump commented on Twitter that the devastation in some places was ""far greater than anyone thought"".\n\nDamage in the United States was estimated at a minimum of $50 billion.At the time, Irma was the fourth costliest tropical cyclone in the United States, behind hurricanes Sandy in 2012, Harvey earlier that year, and Katrina in 2005.However, later in September 2017, Hurricane Maria became the third costliest United States tropical cyclone, causing Irma to fall to the fifth costliest.At least 92 people, 10 directly and 82 indirectly, died throughout the United States in relation to Irma: 84 in Florida, 3 in Georgia, 3 in South Carolina, and 2 in North Carolina.\n\nIrma struck the state less than two weeks after Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten had caused the worst flooding seen in western Florida in 20 years, which further worsened the impacts in the region.The storm\'s large wind field resulted in strong winds across much of Florida, except for the western Panhandle.The highest reported sustained wind speed was on Marco Island, while the strongest observed wind gust was , recorded near Naples, though wind gusts of likely occurred in the Middle Florida Keys.More than 7.7 million homes and businesses in Florida were left without electricity at some point – approximately 73% of state.Generally heavy amounts of rainfall were recorded to the east of the Irma\'s path, including a peak total of in Fort Pierce.Heavy precipitation – and storm surge, in some instances – overflowed at least 32 rivers and creeks, causing significant flooding, particularly along the St. Johns River and its tributaries.Many homes and businesses suffered damage or destruction, with more than 65,000 structures damaged to some degree in West Central and Southwest Florida alone.Agriculture experienced about $2.5 billion in damage.It was estimated that the cyclone caused at least $50 billion in damage, making Irma the costliest hurricane in Florida history, surpassing Hurricane Andrew, until it was itself surpassed by Hurricane Ian, 5 years later.\n\nThroughout Florida, at least 84 people died in storm-related incidents.About half of the deaths occurred from drowning, trauma, and carbon monoxide poisoning.Broward County had 21 fatalities, the most of any county in Florida.Among those deaths were 12 people at The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, a Hollywood nursing home.The patients died from sweltering heat worsened by the lack of air conditioning.The hurricane also left at least 14 deaths in Monroe County; 6 deaths in Orange County; 5 deaths each in Duval, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties; 4 deaths in both Highlands and Hillsborough counties; 3 deaths in both Marion and Polk counties; 2 deaths each in Collier, Hardee, Leon, Pinellas, St. Lucie, and Taylor counties; and 1 death in Hendry, Lake, Lee, Liberty, Manatee, Nassau, Okeechobee, Pasco, Seminole, St. Johns, and Volusia counties.\n\nWith Irma making landfall in Monroe County as a Category 4 hurricane, the Florida Keys were hardest hit area in the state.Strong winds and storm surge flooding caused major damage to buildings, trailer parks, boats, roads, the electricity supply, mobile phone coverage, internet access, sanitation, the water supply and the fuel supply throughout the island chain.An estimated storm surge occurred at Cudjoe Key, where Irma made landfall.Throughout the island, 625 homes sustained minor damage, 52 sustained major damage, and 81 were demolished.On Big Pine Key, one of the most devastated islands, 633 homes received minor impact, 299 homes received major impact, and 473 homes were completely destroyed.Overall in Monroe County, 27,649 homes experienced some degree of damage, including 1,179 homes being destroyed, 2,977 homes receiving major damage, and 5,361 suffering minor damage.\n\nAfter devastating the Keys, the storm then struck Collier County as a Category 3 hurricane.Several communities in the county suffered extensive damage, especially along the coast.Throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, 65 homes, including 44 mobile homes, were demolished, while 1,008 homes received major damage.Property damages in unincorporated areas alone reach about $320 million.Lee County was lashed by strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused prolonged flooding in some areas.More than 24,000 homes suffered some degree of damage, with almost 3,000 homes receiving major damage and 89 homes being destroyed.Damage in the county totaled about $857 million.\n\nImpact in much of the Miami metropolitan area was generally limited to extensive tree and fence damage, as well as widespread power outages.However, in Miami-Dade County, about 1,000 homes received major damage and about 50% of crops were lost.Storm surge caused coastal flooding from Homestead to Downtown Miami, as well as in portions of Miami Beach.Parts of the Florida Heartland were devastated by high winds and flooding, particularly Hendry and Highlands counties.In the former, which has most citrus trees of any county in Florida, about 60% of orange crops were lost.Throughout Hendry County, a total of 451 homes had minor damage, 131 homes suffered major damage, and 42 others were destroyed.In Highlands County, 13,138 businesses and homes were damaged to some degree, with 144 being destroyed, 963 sustaining major damage, and 2,408 receiving minor damage.In Orange County, wind gusts reached 79 mph at Orlando International Airport.A wind gust of 91 mph was also recorded in Orlando at the top of the Disney Contemporary Resort.Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central Florida left some wind damage and flooding, necessitating evacuations and rescues, including more than 200 people in Orlo Vista after hundreds of homes were flooded.A total of 2,999 business or homes were damaged in Lake County, 7,430 in Seminole County, and 3,457 in Volusia County.Additionally, eight tornadoes touched down in Brevard County, all of which caused damage.\n\nAlong much of the Gulf Coast of Florida, to the north of where Irma made landfall, negative storm surges were observed, with water retracting rather than pushing inland, causing little coastal flooding.However, on the opposite coast, extensive erosion and storm surge flooding occurred in the First Coast, especially in Duval and St. Johns counties.In Duval County, the St. Johns River crested at heights that exceeded records set during Hurricane Dora in 1964.Portions of Jacksonville experienced flooding, particularly the downtown area and the Riverside and San Marco neighborhoods, with about 350 people rescued in those sections of the city.Water reached about high in some homes.The city of Jacksonville suffered about $85 million in damage.\n\nIn St. Johns County, storm surge left extensive damage to oceanfront properties in Ponte Vedra Beach and Vilano Beach, with several becoming uninhabitable.Additionally, some riverfront businesses in St. Augustine\'s historic district were flooded due to storm surge from the Matanzas River.In nearby Clay County, rainfall and storm surge combined to cause extensive flooding along portions of the Black Creek and the St. Johns River, with record high crests at several locations along the former.About 350 people and 75 animals were rescued from floodwaters throughout the county.A total of 275 homes were destroyed, 175 were inflicted major damage, and 124 received minor damage.\n\nThree deaths were reported in Georgia due to falling trees and debris, along with widespread wind damage and power outages throughout the state primarily due to fallen trees.On Tybee Island, as well as St. Simons Island the storm surge caused extensive flooding.The tropical storm also did $54 million in damage in the state.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the third highest storm surge on record was recorded, reaching a height of approximately .By of September 12, almost 100,000 had lost power in Upstate South Carolina.Five people died in storm-related incidents across South Carolina, all from indirect incidents.The tropical storm caused damages totaling $500,000 in the state.\n\nLight damage occurred in other areas, including Tennessee.About 75,000 customers in North Carolina lost power due to Irma.It also caused $600,000 in damages in Alabama.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Irma\'s path through the West Indies and Caribbean, the devastation to roads, harbors and airports significantly impeded the transportation and distribution of relief supplies.Foreign countries moved to provide much of the initial aid.The British, Dutch, French, and United States governments sent warships and planes with supplies and manpower to the region.International leaders, including Dutch King Willem-Alexander and French President Emmanuel Macron, quickly moved to visit affected territories.\n\nSome of the affected countries and territories also offered assistance to each other.Cuba, which sustained extensive damage from the storm, sent 750 health workers to Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, Dominica, and Haiti.Government officials and members of the public in Puerto Rico delivered assistance and evacuated people stranded on other islands.The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services granted special 30-day humanitarian visas for British Virgin Islanders to stay in Puerto Rico.Hundreds of people stranded on Saint Martin were flown to the Dominican Republic on humanitarian grounds.\n\nIn response to Hurricane Jose\'s approach, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a mandatory evacuation on September 9 for any remaining residents on Barbuda.A Miami cargo plane landed on Antigua later that day, carrying over 60 tons (120,000 lbs) of relief supplies for the displaced storm victims—including bottled water, canned food and power generators.\n\nRFA Mounts Bay stationed itself near Anguilla and provided support and relief work to the island with its helicopters and 40 marines and army engineers.The ship delivered 6 tonnes of emergency aid to Anguilla and army engineers repaired a fuel leak at Anguilla\'s main petrol dump, restored power to the island\'s hospital and provided shelters for those left homeless by the hurricane.The ship arrived in the British Virgin Islands on September 8, 2017, to provide emergency relief to the islands, including providing shelters, food and water.HMS Ocean was diverted from the Mediterranean to provide relief from Gibraltar to the affected British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos on September 7, and aid was also supplied by the Department for International Development from their disaster response centre at Kemble Airfield.As part of a £32 million operation named Operation Ruman, nearly 500 UK military personnel with emergency relief were dispatched from RAF Brize Norton.This included the first deployment of No. 38 Expeditionary Air Wing with 3 RAF aircraft; 2 Airbus A400M Atlas and 1 C130J hercules to support relief efforts.\n\nThe British government also drafted 2 members of the UK police calibre into the region on September 10, and 53 police officers were drafted from RAF Brize Norton to the affected British Overseas Territories on September 15 to help maintain order.UK politicians, including the chairs of the foreign affairs and development select committees, criticized both the government\'s preparations for the storm and its response as inadequate.\n\nBy September 12, the Department for International Development had delivered more than 40 tonnes of aid into the region, including into Turks and Caicos, and 1,000 UK military troops were deployed in the region as part of relief efforts.The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, pledged an additional £25 million worth of funding as part of relief efforts in the region on September 13, 2017, and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Boris Johnson, said that a further 250 UK military personnel would be deployed into the area within the next few days.Anguilla\'s Chief Minister, Victor Banks, praised the British government\'s response to the storm and said that Boris Johnson\'s visit to the island ""sends a very positive signal to Anguillans that the British are serious about their response to this very severe hurricane"", but went on to say that the current financial commitment from the UK was not substantial enough.\n\nBy September 15, the United Kingdom had over 70 military personnel and 4 police officers in Anguilla and had delivered 15 tonnes of aid to the island.In the British Virgin Islands, Royal Marines had cleared the airfield so that it was operational for the delivery of aid into the islands, with more than 200 British military personnel and 54 UK police officers on the ground and 8 tonnes of aid delivered to the islands.120 British military personnel were on the ground in Turks and Caicos, and over 150 shelter kits and 720 liters of water were delivered to the islands on September 15.\n\nAmendments to international aid rules by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (or OECD) allowed for the UK government to provide access to £13 billion worth of aid to the affected British Overseas Territories, through the UK\'s Official Development Assistance (ODA) by November 2017.\n\nBy the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage.The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by Irma\'s eye, remained largely inaccessible for days.Assessments showed that 15% of the national telecommunications network had been affected, with at least one tower destroyed.Bahamasair resumed a limited domestic schedule on September 10, with international flights still cancelled due to existing and anticipated destruction at other destinations.\n\nThe worst devastation occurred on Ragged Island, over which Irma\'s eye had directly passed.After days of the National Emergency Management Agency not being able to physically reach the island, officials were finally able to inspect it; they promptly declared it uninhabitable.Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said that it was the worst disaster area he or his officials had ever seen, and that all remaining residents would need to leave, potentially permanently.Business leaders and other officials called for a new long-term development model to shift the population away from such sparsely-settled islands.\n\nOn Grand Bahama and Bimini, where tornadoes associated with Irma touched down on September 10, more than 100 people were left displaced.Infrastructure damage included docks, parks, and the power system.\n\nAside from tangible asset losses, Irma brought significant economic damages.International freight shipping was projected to be offline for a week, and costs for rebuilding supplies were inflated due to demand in the U.S.\n\nSwollen rivers contributed to worsening flooding in the days after the storm system left, resulting in additional evacuations.Officials resorted to using inflatable rafts to access affected areas.The national electrical infrastructure was said to be extensively damaged.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, flooding worsened following Irma\'s departure, leading the number of displaced persons to increase to more than 24,000 by September 8.President Danilo Medina ordered further evacuations due to at-risk dams, while the government banned swimming in rivers and ordered boats kept in port.More than 422,000 people were left without water due to 28 aqueducts being damaged.\n\nIn Haiti, officials stated that losses were greater than they could have been since people largely did not heed early preparation and evacuation warnings.At least 5,000 homes were flooded.One man died trying to cross a flooded river; another went missing and 17 were injured.The trash- and waste-contaminated floodwaters in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives led to fears of cholera outbreaks.Flooding continued to worsen days after the storm, as runoff from the mountains swelled rivers in low-lying farming communities.United Nations peacekeepers from Brazil were able to gain access to the flooded northwest region to provide urgent aid, but non-governmental organizations and Haitian economists warned that the estimated 30,000 victims would need longer-term assistance as well.Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant appointed a government commission to address Irma\'s effects, with Action Against Hunger in charge of humanitarian coordination.\n\nIn the USVI, residents and tourists alike were described as being in a state of traumatic shock.By September 7, the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship had arrived in the USVI to provide supplies, damage assessment, and evacuation assistance.Four additional warships, some of which had already been on their way to Texas to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief, were redirected to the region.At a September 10 news conference, Governor Kenneth Mapp described Irma as a ""horrific disaster"" for which ""[t]here will be no restorations or solutions in days or weeks.""The Federal Emergency Management Agency airlifted in goods for residents, who were subjected to a curfew.Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line agreed to transport tourists to Florida, contingent upon port availability following the state\'s own experience with Irma.\n\nOn Saint John, described as ""perhaps the site of Irma\'s worst devastation on American soil,"" it took six days for an active-theater disaster zone to be established, leading to criticism of the U.S. government response.The National Guard was delayed in reaching Saint John due to the number of overturned boats left in the harbor.The National Guard was brought in to maintain order, while the Coast Guard brought evacuees to cruise ships bound for San Juan and Miami.There was still no electricity on St. John in the middle of October 2017.\n\nBy September 9, more than one million Puerto Ricans were still without power, tens of thousands were without water, and several thousand were still in shelters.Hospitals were operating on generator power.The government was struggling to establish contact with the islands of Culebra and Vieques.By September 10, the main island had recovered enough to serve as a refuge for people stranded on other islands, including 1,200 tourists from Saint Martin and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Airlifts had brought more than 50 patients to Puerto Rico.\n\nFive months after Irma, two-thirds of the hospital beds on Saint Thomas were still unavailable, due to extensive physical damage and staffing shortages.\n\nDamage to Sint Maarten\'s harbour and to Princess Juliana International Airport left the Dutch part of Saint Martin unreachable, although the smaller Grand Case-Espérance Airport on the French side could be reopened by September 7 for supply aid by helicopter and airplane.The French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops on board a CASA/IPTN CN-235 aircraft.\n\nThe following day, the Dutch military was able to airlift dialysis patients off the island while also dropping leaflets to warn islanders about the rapidly approaching Hurricane Jose.Although the airport was closed, 435 students and faculty of the American University of the Caribbean were evacuated by the U.S. military.On September 10, Dutch King Willem-Alexander departed for the region, with intentions to visit Sint Maarten and other affected Dutch territories and commonwealth members.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron followed this announcement by stating his intentions to visit the French part of the island on September 12 in order to bring aid supplies.In response to criticism of the French handling of the disaster, 1,000 troops, police, and other emergency workers were sent to Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.\n\nOn both sides of Saint Martin, desperate conditions combined with food and water shortages in Irma\'s aftermath led to reports of violence, scavenging, and theft.In response, the French government increased its troop deployment to 2,200 and the Dutch government sent more than 600 military and police personnel.\n\nThe day after the hurricane hit Saint Barthelemy the French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops into the reopened Grand Case-Espérance Airport.On September 7 and 9, equipment and personnel were flown from France to Guadeloupe and Martinique.\n\nSporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm.\n\nOn September 11, Florida Governor Rick Scott conducted an aerial tour to survey the damage to the Keys.The Overseas Highway remained closed while authorities assessed the integrity of the 42 bridges along the route.Residents returning to the Keys were faced with a police roadblock, to the south of Florida City.USS Iwo Jima, USS New York and aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were sent to the Keys area to aid with the recovery.\n\nOn September 12, some residents were allowed to return into the Keys as far as Islamorada.Although road damage blocked entry any farther than Islamorada, bridges had been inspected and found safe to Sugarloaf Key.By late on September 12, the Overseas Highway had been repaired and the bridges inspected as safe for first responders to travel to Key West.On September 16, residents were free to return to Marathon.Residents were allowed to return to Key West the following day, although the Keys remained closed to tourists and a checkpoint remained in place in Florida City.\n\nDue mainly to the widespread loss of power, cell phone service was also reduced after battery backup power for cell phone towers ran out and backup generators ran out of fuel.In an impact report by the FCC, as of 11 AM EDT on September 12, 89 of 108 (82%) cell phone towers were non-functioning in Monroe County (Florida Keys), 154 of 212 (73%) were non-functioning in Collier County (Naples), 36 of 46 (78%) were non-functioning in Hendry County, and an additional six counties had 41-60% of cell phone towers not functioning, including Lee County (Fort Myers) and Miami-Dade County.\n\nNOAA released map-format aerial reconnaissance image data of damage from the storm.The imagery featured several areas of Florida: including the Florida Keys, the southwest coast of Florida from Marco Island to Punta Gorda, much of the northeast coast of Florida, and portions of the Jacksonville area.Portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts were also photographed.Additionally, the Sun-Sentinel published before and after photos of several landmarks in the Florida Keys.\n\nIn the days after the hurricane, due to the heavy rainfall, numerous rivers had flooded, including residential areas.Public health risks, such as diarrheal infections and mosquito-borne illnesses, remain from the flooding that resulted in the aftermath of the hurricane.A large concern from flooding is contamination because people become exposed to dirty floodwaters and the potential for contaminated water to enter the local water supply is significant.One example of an illness that can enter the water supply is leptospirosis, which is rat urine carries into the floodwaters.Untreated exposure to leptospirosis can cause kidney damage, meningitis, and liver failure.Noroviruses and other infections are also a risk.\n\nFollowing Irma\'s passage, a hand-carved wooden canoe was discovered on the banks of the Indian River and could be several hundred years old.The state has removed the canoe for examination and safe keeping.\n\nDue to Irma\'s and Hurricane Harvey\'s impact in Florida and Texas, U.S. employment declined in September 2017 for the first time since September 2010.The leisure and hospitality industries were especially hard hit, losing 111,000 jobs in September.\n\nIrma set multiple records for intensity, especially at easterly longitudes, time spent at such an intensity, and its intensity at landfall.When Irma reached Category 5 intensity with winds of at 11:45 UTC on September 5 at 57.7°W, it became the easternmost Atlantic hurricane of this strength on record, surpassing Hurricane David of 1979, later beaten by Hurricane Lorenzo 2 years later.By 00:15 UTC on September 6, Irma reached peak intensity with () winds and a minimum pressure of .This ties it with Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and Hurricane Rita of 2005 as the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed.Only five other Atlantic hurricanes have been recorded with wind speeds higher than Irma: Hurricane Allen of 1980, which had maximum sustained winds of , and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Gilbert of 1988, Hurricane Wilma of 2005, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, all of which had peak winds of .At the time, Irma was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; later surpassed by Hurricane Dorian, and was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007.In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category 5 strength winds, and the third-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, with a value of 64.9 units.Only the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane and Hurricane Ivan in 2004 achieved higher values.\n\nOn September 6, Irma made landfall on the islands of Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Virgin Gorda at peak strength.This ties Irma with cyclones Monica of 2006 and Winston of 2016, and typhoons Zeb of 1998 and Megi of 2010 as the seventh-strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall globally – in terms of sustained winds – trailing only Typhoon Goni of 2020 which bore winds of at landfall, Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 and Typhoon Meranti of 2016, which bore winds of at landfall, and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Typhoon Joan of 1959, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, which bore winds of at landfall.Irma is second to the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin, and is the first hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic at Category 5 status since Felix in 2007.Irma is the first recorded Category 5 hurricane to affect the northern Leeward Islands, and was one of the worst storms to hit the region on record, along with Hurricane Donna in 1960 and Hurricane Luis in 1995.In addition, Irma is only the second hurricane on record to make landfall in Cuba at Category 5 intensity, with the other being a hurricane in 1924.Furthermore, when Irma made landfall on Barbuda, Saint Martin, Virgin Gorda, and Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane, it became one of only two recorded Atlantic storms to make landfall in multiple nations at this strength; the other was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which struck both Eleuthera and the United States as a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nIrma made landfall in the Florida Keys with winds of and a pressure of , making it the strongest hurricane to strike Florida in terms of wind speed since Charley in 2004, and the most intense to strike the state in terms of barometric pressure since Andrew in 1992.In the span of two weeks, two Category 4 hurricanes—Harvey and Irma—struck the continental United States, the first time on record two Atlantic tropical cyclones of such strength made landfall on the country in the same hurricane season.This also marked only the third occurrence of two consecutive Atlantic storms making landfall in the United States as major hurricanes.The other two instances were the Great Charleston and Cheniere Caminada hurricanes in 1893, and hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne in 2004.\n\nBecause of the extensive damage and loss of life the hurricane caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Irma from its rotating naming lists in April 2018, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane.It was replaced with Idalia for the 2023 season.\n\nWeather of 2017 Tropical cyclones in 2017 List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes Operation RUMAN – UK military-civil disaster relief response to Hurricane Irma.List of Cuba hurricanes List

45,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Hurricane Irma', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'Hurricane Irma was an extremely powerful Cape Verde hurricane that caused widespread destruction across its path in early September 2017.Irma was the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the Leeward Islands on record, followed by Maria two weeks later.At the time, it was considered the most powerful hurricane on record in the open Atlantic region, outside of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, until it was surpassed by Hurricane Dorian two years later.It was also the third-strongest Atlantic hurricane at landfall ever recorded, just behind the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane and Dorian.The ninth named storm, fourth hurricane, second major hurricane, and first Category 5 hurricane of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Irma caused widespread and catastrophic damage throughout its long lifetime, particularly in the northeastern Caribbean and the Florida Keys.It was also the most intense hurricane to strike the continental United States since Katrina in 2005, the first major hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Wilma in the same year, and the first Category 4 hurricane to strike the state since Charley in 2004.The word Irmageddon was coined soon after the hurricane to describe the damage caused by the hurricane.\n\nIrma developed from a tropical wave near the Cape Verde Islands on August 30.Favorable conditions allowed Irma to rapidly intensify into a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson wind scale by late on August 31.The storm\'s intensity fluctuated between Categories 2 and 3 for the next several days, due to a series of eyewall replacement cycles.On September 4, Irma resumed intensifying, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by early on the next day.Early on September 6, Irma peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of and a minimum pressure of .Irma was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017 in terms of barometric pressure, and the strongest worldwide in 2017 in terms of wind speed.Another eyewall replacement cycle caused Irma to weaken back to a Category 4 hurricane, but the storm re-attained Category 5 status before making landfall in Cuba.Although Irma briefly weakened to a Category 2 storm while making landfall on Cuba, the system re-intensified to Category 4 status as it crossed the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, before making landfall on Cudjoe Key on September 10.Irma then weakened to Category 3 status, prior to another landfall in Florida on Marco Island later that day.The system degraded into a remnant low over Alabama and ultimately dissipated on September 13 over Missouri.\n\nThe storm caused catastrophic damage in Barbuda, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Anguilla, and the Virgin Islands as a Category 5 hurricane.The hurricane caused at least 134 deaths: one in Anguilla; one in Barbados; three in Barbuda; four in the British Virgin Islands; 10 in Cuba; 11 in the French West Indies; one in Haiti; three in Puerto Rico; four on the Dutch side of Sint Maarten; 92 in the contiguous United States, and four in the U.S. Virgin Islands.Hurricane Irma was the top Google searched term in the U.S. and globally in 2017.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa on August 26.The tropical wave moved off the coast of the continent late on August 27.Throughout the next two days, showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low-pressure area, as the system passed just south of and then through the Cape Verde Islands on August 29.Around 00:00 UTC on the following day, the system developed into a tropical depression just west of the Cape Verde Islands.Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Irma, based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates.With warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, strengthening was anticipated, with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier air.\n\nThe nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow, as an anticyclone became established over the system, with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images.Early on August 31, shortly after the development of a central dense overcast (CDO) and an eye feature, Irma underwent rapid intensification, becoming a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 UTC and then a Category 3 hurricane, becoming a major hurricane – around 00:00 UTC on September 1.Within a 48-hour period, the hurricane\'s intensity had increased by .On September 2, a ship passed to the west of the center of Irma, recording maximum winds of , which indicated that the eye of Irma remained compact.A strong high pressure system to the north of Irma caused the storm to move west-southwestward between September 2 and September 4.The first aircraft reconnaissance mission departed from Barbados on the afternoon of September 3, discovering an eye in diameter and surface winds of .\n\nOn September 4, after moving into more favorable conditions, Irma strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane.As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by 12:00 UTC on the following day, with winds of .The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at near 18:00 UTC on September 5. Irma acquired annular characteristics around this time, with the storm exhibiting a large, symmetric CDO and an impressive satellite appearance.Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern Leeward Islands.Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of Barbuda at peak intensity, with the storm\'s central minimum pressure having bottomed out at – this was the lowest in the Atlantic since Dean in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of .Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15 UTC on Sint Maarten, and at 16:30 UTC on Virgin Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands, though the storm\'s central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall.\n\nAs the hurricane moved away from the Virgin Islands late on September 6, observations from reconnaissance flights, as well as Doppler radar in San Juan, Puerto Rico, indicated an elliptical eye and double eyewalls.Late on September 6, the cyclone passed about north of Puerto Rico.Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of Hispaniola throughout the day on September 7.After beginning an eyewall replacement cycle, Irma weakened to a Category 4 hurricane as it passed south of the Turks and Caicos Islands early on September 8.This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category 5 intensity, the second-longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above – behind only the 1932 Cuba hurricane.At 05:00 UTC on September 8, Irma made landfall on the island of Little Inagua in the Bahamas with sustained winds of .The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a subtropical ridge to its north.Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category 5 intensity at 18:00 UTC that day east of Cuba as deep convection became more pronounced and organized.The hurricane then made landfall in Cayo Romano, Cuba, at 03:00 UTC on September 9, with winds of .This made Irma only the second Category 5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the 1924 Cuba hurricane.As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category 2 storm later on September 9.\n\nAfter slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards Florida around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental United States.Moving over the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, Irma quickly restrengthened to a Category 4 hurricane at 06:00 UTC on September 10, as deep convection improved and the eye became better defined.In addition, Irma\'s wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of and gale-force winds spanning in diameter.The cyclone made landfall in Cudjoe Key, Florida, at 13:00 UTC on September 10, at Category 4 intensity, with winds of .Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category 3 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30 UTC, in Marco Island, Florida, with sustained winds of .Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category 3 intensity hours after landfall.Passing east of Tampa as a weakening Category 1 hurricane around 06:00 UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation – though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds.The system finally weakened to a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC that day as it entered southern Georgia, while acquiring some extratropical characteristics.At 06:00 UTC on September 12, Irma degenerated to a remnant low just as it entered Alabama, as most of the deep convection had diminished.The remnants persisted for another day or so before dissipating over Missouri on September 13.\n\nGiven that Irma\'s forecast track was along much of the Caribbean island chain, hurricane warnings were issued for the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and parts of Hispaniola on September 5.\n\nIn Antigua and Barbuda, residents safeguarded their homes and cleaned up their properties in anticipation of strong winds.Emergency crews were put on standby at public shelters and hospitals by September 5 to assist with any evacuations.Expecting a direct hit, more than half of the residents on Barbuda took shelter, and relief supplies were preemptively mobilized.The National Emergency Management Organization on Saint Lucia urged small craft operators and swimmers to be mindful of forecasts for high surf.Small Craft Warnings and High Surf Advisories were hoisted for Dominica, where residents were urged to remain vigilant of the potential for high waves, landslides, and flooding.\n\nIn Guadeloupe, low-lying and cliff-edge homes were evacuated at the threat of flooding and erosion.Schools and public businesses closed on September 5 and 6.Hospitals stocked up on three days\' worth of supplies and checked the functionality of their generators.Of the island\'s 32 communes, 22 activated their emergency plans; 1,500 people were urged to take shelter.The island sustained relatively minor damage and became the base for relief efforts on Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.Though the core of the hurricane was expected to remain north of the island, a yellow alert was issued for Martinique due to the likelihood of rough seas.The island dispatched relief supplies and military reinforcements to its neighboring islands of Guadeloupe, Saint Martin.and Saint Barthélemy, which faced a greater risk of a direct impact.\n\nOn September 4, Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency.By September 6, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency had deployed response teams in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.Supplies, including food rations, medical supplies, and blankets, were pre-staged in strategic locations on the islands for distribution.\n\nOn September 5, the Dominican Republic activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage; the United States and Haiti followed suit two days later.According to officials, 11,200 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas prior to the storm\'s arrival.Approximately 7,400 tourists were moved to Santo Domingo, away from beach resorts.In Haiti, government officials and aid organizations struggled with early preparation and evacuation efforts.While some officials blamed reluctance and indifference on the part of the population, others ""admitted they were not prepared for the onslaught and no mandatory evacuation orders were in place ahead of Irma\'s approach.""Local officials contended that they had not received promised funds, supplies, or equipment from the national government.The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti prepared its 1,000 peacekeepers and engineers to assist.\n\nIn the Turks and Caicos, evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas starting September 5. Schools were closed, government buildings were boarded up, and shelters were opened.Officials spread warnings to residents in English, Creole, and Spanish via social media, radio, SMS text, and WhatsApp.In The Bahamas, the government began preparations the week prior to the hurricane\'s arrival, including securing national sports facilities to use as shelters.By September 7, the government had evacuated 1,609 people by air from the southern islands, including 365 from Bimini.Controlled cutting of the power supply to southern and central Bahamian islands was conducted in advance of the storm.Shelters were made available, though usage was low due to most evacuees staying with family on other islands.Of the 2,679 foreign tourists still in The Bahamas on September 7, about 1,200 were being housed at Atlantis Paradise Island, one of the most hurricane-ready structures in the country.\n\nIn Cuba, meteorologists did not initially predict a direct hit.Fuel conservation was enacted in Camagüey Province to ensure that enough would be available during post-storm power outages.The Civil Defense evacuated nearly one million people from low-lying areas, including thousands of Canadian and European tourists in the Jardines del Rey.Dolphins at a Cayo Guillermo resort were evacuated by helicopter.\n\nThe NHC issued several watches and warnings for the Southeastern United States.The first watches and warnings were issued at 15:00 UTC on September 7, which was a hurricane watch from the Jupiter Inlet to Bonita Beach, including the Florida Keys and Lake Okeechobee.The watches and warnings were extended into Georgia and South Carolina on September 9.At 21:00 UTC on that day, the advisories reached their maximum extent, with a hurricane warning covering the entire east coast of the state, the west coast from Indian Pass southward, and the Florida Keys; a hurricane watch was in place from the Florida–Georgia state line to Edisto Beach, South Carolina; and there were two tropical storm warnings, one in Florida from Indian Pass to the Okaloosa–Walton county line and the other from the Florida–Georgia state line to the South Santee River in South Carolina.Watches and warnings were gradually discontinued as Irma moved inland and weakened, with all of them canceled by early on September 12.\n\nOn September 4, Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency.Governor Scott placed 100 members of the Florida National Guard on duty to assist in preparations.All 7,000 troops were ordered to be on duty by September 8.Officials advised residents to stock their hurricane kits.The state coordinated with electrical companies in order for power outages to be restored as quickly as possible, extending resources such as equipment, fuel, and lodging for the approximately 24,000 restoration personnel who had been activated.Governor Scott suspended tolls on all toll roads in Florida, including the turnpike.All state offices in Florida were closed from September 8 to September 11, while public schools, state colleges, and state universities in all 67 counties were closed during the same period.The Florida Department of Education coordinated with school districts as the need for transportation by school buses and opening shelters arose.By September 9, more than 150 state parks were closed.Throughout the state, almost 700 emergency shelters were opened.The shelters collectively housed about 191,764 people, with more than 40% of them staying in a shelter in South Florida.Additionally, more than 60 special needs shelters were opened, which housed more than 5,000 people by September 9.\n\nMany airports across the state, particularly in Central and South Florida, were closed.Nearly 9,000 flights intending to arrive in or depart from Florida were canceled.Along Florida\'s coasts, most seaports were closed or opened with restricted access.For the fifth time in its 45-year history, the Walt Disney World Resort was completely closed due to the storm.Its theme parks, water parks, and Disney Springs were all closed by 9:00 p.m. on September 9 and remained closed until September 12.Other Orlando-area theme parks, including Universal Orlando Resort and SeaWorld Orlando, were also closed.The Kennedy Space Center was closed from September 8 to September 15.\n\nAn estimated 6.5 million Floridians were ordered to evacuate, mostly those living on barrier islands or in coastal areas; in mobile or sub-standard homes; and in low-lying or flood prone areas.Mandatory evacuations were ordered for portions of Brevard, Broward, Citrus, Collier, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Glades, Hendry, Hernando, Indian River, Lee, Martin, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Sarasota, Seminole, St. Lucie, Sumter, and Volusia counties.All of Monroe County, where the Florida Keys are located, was placed under a mandatory evacuation.Residents in communities near the southern half of Lake Okeechobee were also ordered to leave.Additionally, voluntary evacuation notices were issued for all or parts of Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Charlotte, Columbia, Desoto, Hardee, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lake, Manatee, Okeechobee, Osceola, and Polk counties.\n\nA record 6.5 million Floridians evacuated, making it the largest evacuation in the state\'s history.Evacuees caused significant traffic congestion on northbound Interstate 95, Interstate 75, and Florida\'s Turnpike, exacerbated by the fact that the entire Florida peninsula was within the cone of uncertainty in the NHC\'s forecast path in the days before the storm, so evacuees from both coasts headed north, as evacuees would not be safer by fleeing to the opposite coast.Fuel was in short supply throughout peninsular Florida during the week before Irma\'s arrival, especially along evacuation routes, leading to hours-long lines at fuel stations and even escorts of fuel trucks by the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nUse of the left shoulder as a lane for moving traffic was allowed on northbound Interstate 75 from Wildwood to the Georgia state line beginning September 8 and on eastbound Interstate 4 from Tampa to State Road 429 near Celebration for a few hours on September 9.It was the first time that the shoulder-use plan, which was introduced at the start of the 2017 hurricane season, was implemented by the state for hurricane evacuations.The shoulder-use plan was implemented in place of labor- and resource-intensive contraflow lane reversal, in which both sides of an interstate highway are used for one direction of traffic.\n\nOfficials from the Environmental Protection Agency, which had been criticized for its response to Hurricane Harvey, took special measures to inspect and secure hazardous materials, especially at Superfund sites.Direct Relief, a disaster relief organization, coordinated with local health centers and provided resources to help facilities on the front lines of Floridian and Puerto Rican communities.\n\nGeorgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency initially for all six coastal counties on September 6, but eventually expanded the declaration to 94 counties south of Atlanta metropolitan area, and then the entire state on September 10.Atlanta was placed under its first-ever tropical storm warning.Governor Deal ordered mandatory evacuations for all areas east of Interstate 95 on September 7, before extending the order to the entirety of Chatham County and low-lying areas west of I-95 on the following day.In total, 540,000 people on the Georgia coast were ordered to leave.Contraflow lane reversal for Interstate 16 took effect on the morning of September 9 from Savannah to Dublin, Georgia.All Georgia state parks were open for free to evacuees, as was the 800-acre camping area at Atlanta Motor Speedway.Reversible HOT lanes on Interstate 75 in Georgia through south metro Atlanta were open 24 hours northbound with no tolls.\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on September 6, with South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster following suit the same day.Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency on September 8 in order to protect Virginia residents and to mobilize resources in support of neighboring states.Officials in New Orleans stated that there would not be much time for preparations if Irma failed to make the projected northward turn, but that South Texas or Florida would not be a good evacuation destination.On September 10, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam issued an executive order allowing medical professionals in other states to practice in Tennessee to aid Hurricane Irma evacuees.This order also allowed pharmacies to give out 14-day supplies of medicine, and gave women and children from outside the state the ability to participate in the Tennessee Department of Health programs.Bristol Motor Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway, and Charlotte Motor Speedway all opened their campgrounds to evacuees free of charge.\n\nIn professional sports, the Miami Dolphins–Tampa Bay Buccaneers game scheduled for September 10 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was postponed to November 19 due to the storm\'s threat.The Dolphins left early for their road game against the Los Angeles Chargers.The Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees moved their September 11–13 series from Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg to Citi Field in Queens.Minor League Baseball\'s Florida State League, Carolina League, and Southern League called off their championship finals and as a result, named their division series winners league co-champions.The Miami FC versus San Francisco Deltas match on September 10 was cancelled so the players and staff could prepare for the storm with their families.The Orlando Pride of the National Women\'s Soccer League rescheduled their September 9 match to September 7. Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer did not have any scheduled home games in September, but was unable to return to training facilities in Orlando due to Hurricane Irma.\n\nIn college football, the UCF Knights-Memphis Tigers game scheduled for September 9 was moved to September 30, replacing UCF\'s game against Maine and Memphis game against Georgia State.UCF also cancelled their game against Georgia Tech on September 16, as UCF\'s stadium hosted the National Guard.The USF Bulls-Connecticut Huskies football game was also cancelled.The Miami Hurricanes–Arkansas State Redwolves game

Tallahassee, originally scheduled for September 16, was postponed tp October 7.The FIU Panthers game against the Alcorn State Braves was moved up a day and relocated to Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.The Georgia Southern Eagles game against the New Hampshire Wildcats on September 9 was also moved to Legion Field for that day.\n\nAs of September 5, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding was running dangerously low, due to its response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas the previous week, prompting the Trump administration to request an immediate $8 billion in additional funding as Irma approached Florida.Given the rate that current funds are being consumed and the catastrophic damage, the United States Senate almost doubled the requested amount to $15.3 billion, with the understanding that this would only be about 10% of what will be required for responding to Harvey.\n\nHurricane Irma\'s path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating, with landfalls in Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Martin, the Bahamas, Cuba, and the United States, all at major hurricane intensity.Furthermore, the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences.Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria.\n\nThe eyewall of the hurricane moved over Barbuda near its record peak intensity early on September 6; a weather station observed a wind gust of .The same station also recorded a minimum barometric pressure of .The exact state of the island remained unclear for hours after Irma\'s passage, as downed phone lines ceased all communication with nearby islands.Later that afternoon, Prime Minister Gaston Browne surveyed the territory by helicopter, revealing an effectively uninhabitable island.Irma damaged or destroyed 95% of the structures on Barbuda, including its hospital, schools, and both of its hotels; it completely flattened some residential blocks while submerging others.The destruction rendered the island\'s sole airport and much of its infrastructure inoperative—including water and telecommunication services—which further hampered relief efforts.Property damage on Barbuda ranged from $150 million to $300 million.A total of three storm-related deaths were reported on the island.\n\nIn addition to the catastrophic impact on Barbuda\'s human residents, concern turned to the storm\'s effects on the island\'s wildlife.The island\'s only endemic bird, the near-threatened Barbuda warbler, numbered less than 2,000 individuals prior to the hurricane.For some time it was unknown if the warbler survived the hurricane or its aftermath; however within a few months it was confirmed that not only did the species survive, but the most of the birds survived the storm.Barbuda\'s Codrington Lagoon, home to the largest colony of magnificent frigatebirds in the Caribbean, with an estimated 2,500 nesting pairs, was also inundated by the storm surge.\n\nRemaining just outside of Irma\'s strongest windfield, Antigua sustained less severe damage, in the form of leveled roofs and fences, downed power poles and lines, and uprooted trees.Some street flooding also took place in low-lying areas.Three people were treated for minor storm-related injuries.Forensic disaster analysts from the Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM), a Germany-based risk management agency, estimate that economic losses for Antigua and Barbuda will exceed $120 million.\n\nOn the morning of September 6, Irma\'s center crossed the island of Saint Martin while the storm was at peak intensity, sweeping away entire structures, submerging roads and cars, and triggering an island-wide blackout.Irma\'s extreme winds ripped trees out of the ground and sent vehicles and debris from damaged structures scattered across the territory.On the French side of Saint-Martin, entire marinas around Marigot were left in ruins, littered with the stranded remnants of boats that had smashed into each other.A hotel caught on fire, but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze.Another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor.Media images depicted devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds had shattered their windows.Irma killed four people on the French side of the island and injured 50 others, one of whom was in critical condition.As many as 95% of the buildings there were damaged to some degree; 60% of those were totally uninhabitable.Estimates from CEDIM indicate a minimum of $950 million worth of economic losses.Total losses exceeded €3.5 billion (US$4.17 billion).\n\nA similar situation unfolded in Sint Maarten, Saint Martin\'s Dutch half, as intense winds ripped through buildings and lifted vehicles aloft ""as if they were matches"".The hurricane wreaked havoc on Princess Juliana International Airport, with ""huge chunks of the building [strewn] across the runway and a jet bridge snapped in half.""It demolished or severely damaged about 70% of Sint Maarten\'s houses, forcing thousands of residents into public shelters.There were 4 deaths and 23 injuries, 11 of which were serious, in the Dutch territory.Irma is considered the worst natural disaster to hit Sint Maarten; the extent of its damage far exceeded that of any previous hurricane.Total damages were estimated at €2.5 billion (US$2.98 billion).\n\nIrma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the French island of Saint Barthélemy, southeast of Saint Martin.Describing the extent of the destruction, one local compared it to ""a bomb that burned all vegetation,"" while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively ""erased the island from the map"".Violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments, with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation.Streets in the capital of Gustavia were turned into rushing rivers, which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture.The island\'s fire station was inundated with up to of flood waters.With scores of homes and much of the infrastructure destroyed, the majority of the island\'s population was left stranded and without water, electricity or phone service.The associated economic losses could exceed $480 million according to CEDIM\'s analysts.\n\nPreliminary assessments from the French government indicate that Hurricane Irma caused a combined €1.2 billion (US$1.43 billion) in insured losses across the French territories of Saint-Martin and Saint Barts.This total covered private property such as homes, vehicles and businesses (including lost revenue); the extent of the damage to infrastructural and public facilities remains undetermined.Nonetheless, this made Irma one of the costliest natural disasters to hit the French Republic in 50 years.\n\nOn January 30, 2018, roughly five months after Irma, an analysis was published indicating that an anemometer on the island recorded an unofficial gust to before failing.\n\nThe British Overseas Territory of Anguilla saw the eyewall of the storm pass over it on September 6.Many homes and schools were destroyed, and the island\'s only hospital was badly damaged.The devastation was particularly severe in East End, where the winds uprooted scores of trees and power poles and demolished a number of houses.In The Valley, the island\'s capital, the hurricane blew out the windows of government buildings.Rough seas inflicted heavy damage upon several bays and harbors, and a seaside restaurant was completely eradicated.About 90% of roads were left impassable.The island\'s air traffic control tower was damaged, exacerbating the already poor communication with the island.One death was reported on the island.Estimates of losses on the island total at least $190 million.\n\nLarge swells ahead of Irma washed ashore debris and sea life in Castries, Saint Lucia, blocking some roads.Seaside roads were inundated with water.One surfer was killed amid rough surf in Barbados after hitting a reef and breaking his neck.Trees were also destroyed.The hurricane\'s effects, such as violent seas and rattling trees, were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in Guadeloupe.Several houses were damaged.Around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm, leaving several communes in the dark without running water.Overall damage was limited to external parts of houses and trees that were blown onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seas.\n\nSaint Kitts and Nevis endured similar conditions to other islands.Blustery rainstorms triggered scattered power outages and disabled the island\'s water system, but per the International Red Cross, the islands were spared the level of destruction seen elsewhere.Still, Prime Minister Timothy Harris stated that property and infrastructure had sustained ""significant damage.""The Dutch territories of Saba and Sint Eustatius were also struck by the hurricane\'s winds, resulting in infrastructural damage, water shortages and telecommunication outages.Several houses were left uninhabitable.On Saba, the hurricane also defoliated trees and injured a few people.CEDIM\'s analysts expect economic losses of $20–65 million for the two islands.\n\nDamage in the British Virgin Islands was extensive.Numerous buildings and roads were destroyed on the island of Tortola, which bore the brunt of the hurricane\'s core.Four people were confirmed dead.Along Cane Garden Bay, the storm surge submerged several seaside bars and a gas station.Satellite images revealed many of the island\'s residential zones had been left in ruins.The hurricane passed over Necker Island, also causing severe damage and destroying the mansion of Richard Branson.\n\nMost homes and businesses were destroyed on the island of Jost Van Dyke, the smallest of the B.V.I.\'s four main islands.The Governor, Gus Jaspert, who had only been sworn into office 13 days previously, declared a state of emergency - the first time this has ever happened in the Territory.After the storm, restoration of electricity took approximately 5 months.\n\nIrma\'s effects in the U.S. Virgin Islands were most profound on Saint Thomas, where at least of rain fell, and on Saint John.Saint Thomas island suffered widespread structural damage, including to its police station and airport.Patients from the fourth and third floors of Charlotte Amalie\'s hospital had to be relocated to lower floors due to flooding from roof leaks.Three deaths were attributed to Irma on the island.On nearby Saint Croix, there were communication issues and some damage to the infrastructure.Saint John lost access to ferry and cargo services, along with access to the local airport.Due to its normal reliance on electricity from Saint Thomas, the island was left without power.Total damage from the three islands was at least $1.1 billion.\n\nThe hurricane passed north of Puerto Rico, but still caused significant damage to the United States territory.Along the coast, a tide gauge observed waves up to mean higher high water.Much of the main island experienced sustained tropical storm force winds, with a peak sustained wind speed of at a weather station along San Juan Bay, while the same site observed a peak wind gust of .However, on the island of Culebra, a wind gust of was reported.Mainly due to strong winds, approximately 1.1 million out of 1.5 million of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority\'s customers lost electricity.Portions of Puerto Rico received heavy rainfall, with a peak total of in Bayamón, causing seven rivers to reach flood stage, widespread flash flooding, and at least six landslides.\n\nThe most severely affected areas included the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques, as well as the northeastern, northern, and mountainous portions of the main island.On Culebra, the island suffered an almost complete loss of electrical and water services.At least 30 homes on the island were destroyed, while about 30 other experienced substantial damage.High winds also toppled a number of trees.The only telecommunications tower on Culebra sustained damage, cutting off outside communications for several hours.In rural Loíza, 79 homes were destroyed.Throughout Puerto Rico, 781 out of 1,600 telecommunications towers went out of commission, primarily due to power outages.At least 362,000 customers lost water services.Debris, mostly fallen trees, blocked at least 72 roads.Approximately 25% to 30% of banana, coffee, papaya, and plantain crops were damaged by strong winds, with losses to farmers estimated at $30.6 million.Approximately 1,530 homes experienced at least moderate damage, with 1,448 homes moderately damaged, 32 extensively damaged, and 50 completely destroyed.\n\nHurricane Irma was attributed to around $1 billion in damage, and the NHC attributed three fatalities to Irma in Puerto Rico, though four deaths were related to the storm.Two people died due to rainstorms ahead of the hurricane: one man died in Orocovis after falling off his ladder while repairing his roof; another man on the coast in Capitanejo died after being struck by lightning.Three nearby fishermen were burned by the same lightning strike, but survived.Two other people died during the hurricane: a woman died while being evacuated from her house in a wheelchair and fell, hitting her head; another person died in a car accident in Canóvanas.Governor Ricardo Rosselló declared the islands of Culebra and Vieques to be disaster areas.\n\nAlthough spared a direct hit, both the Dominican Republic and Haiti were affected by high winds and heavy rains.A bridge over the Dajabón River connecting the two countries was broken.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, the fishing community of Nagua sustained damage from waves that destroyed homes.55,000 soldiers were deployed to affected areas to help with the clean-up efforts.By the evening of September 7, the government had counted 2,721 damaged homes.\n\nIn Haiti, flooding one meter deep sat in residential neighborhoods in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives.Mudslides, destroyed homes, flooded crops, and infrastructure damage were reported in the northern part of the country.The total expanse of the flooding stretched from Môle-Saint-Nicolas in the west to the eastern border with the Dominican Republic.\n\nOn the evening of September 7, at 7:30 pm AST (23:30 UTC), Hurricane Irma reached the Turks and Caicos Islands.While the eye passed just south of the main islands, crossing over South Caicos and the Ambergris Cays, the most powerful winds on the northern side of the eye swept all of the islands for more than two hours.Communications infrastructure was destroyed.\n\nOn September 8, Minister of Infrastructure Goldray Ewing confirmed that damage to Providenciales was extensive, with the northwestern neighborhood of Blue Hill being ""gone"".The hospital in the capital, Cockburn Town, was heavily damaged.On South Caicos, 75% of roofs were lost.Total damage was estimated at over $500 million.\n\nIn the Bahamas, the eye of the storm passed over Duncan Town, the major settlement of the Ragged Islands chain, on September 8.It also passed ""almost directly over"" Inagua and South Acklins, according to the Bahamas Department of Meteorology.\n\nDamages were largely confined to the southern islands starting the morning of September 8.On Mayaguana and Great Inagua, downed power lines knocked out communications.On Great Inagua, 70% of homes sustained roof damage, and the island\'s school lost its roof entirely.The Morton Salt Company\'s signature production facility, one of the major employers in the country, experienced millions of dollars in damages.The Acklins settlement of Salina Point was cut off from the rest of the island by flooding, while Crooked Island had widespread roof damage.In the northern Bahamas, the worst property damage came on September 10 as the outer bands of the system produced tornadic activity on Grand Bahama and Bimini.Damage and losses across The Bahamas amounted to $135 million.\n\nWhile Irma was making landfall in Florida, the ocean was drawn away from some western shorelines of the Bahamas due to strong easterly winds.\n\nEarly on September 9, Irma made landfall on the Camagüey Archipelago off the northern coast of Cuba, with sustained winds of .The strongest official sustained wind speed was , while the highest wind gust reached ; both were observed near Camila in Ciego de Ávila Province.The weather station at Esmeralda, Camagüey, was damaged, with the wind gauge destroyed.The north coast of Cuba experienced significant coastal flooding due to storm surge and abnormally high tides generated by the storm.Wave heights at Cayo Romano exceeded .Storm surge penetrated as far as inland in some areas of Villa Clara Province.Multiple locations on the island observed at least of rainfall, with a peak total of of precipitation at Topes de Collantes.\n\nA total of 158,554 homes experienced some degree of damage, of which 14,657 were destroyed; approximately 1.9 million people experienced the direct effects of Irma.The storm partially deroofed 103,691 homes, while 23,560 were completely deroofed.Irma damaged or destroyed 980 health facilities and 2,264 schools.Approximately 3.1 million people experienced disruptions to the water supply, while 246,707 people lost telephone service.About of roads were damaged.Crops also suffered extensively, with nearly affected by the storm.Throughout the country, the hurricane inflicted $13.185 billion in damage and killed 10 people, making Irma the costliest tropical cyclone in Cuban history.\n\nThe tourist areas of Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and Cayo Santa María and the nearby town of Caibarién received the brunt of the storm, with waves rolling through town and the characteristic one-story homes completely flooded.The storm most severely Ciego de Ávila and Villa Clara provinces.Flooding worsened as the hurricane moved west, pushing the storm surge along to the regions around Havana.By the afternoon, limited flooding was occurring in Havana, including around the Malecón.Portions of province coastal flooding surpassing that which was experienced during the Storm of the Century in 1993 and Hurricane Wilma in 2005.In the city of Santa Clara, 39 buildings collapsed.Rainfall resulted in several rivers reaching major flood stage.The town of Cabaiguán in Sancti Spíritus Province in particular suffered extensive inland flooding after the Zaza River swelled.\n\nHurricane Irma directly affected a major colony of American flamingos on Cuba\'s northern Cayo Coco.Early reports from Diario de Cuba indicated that several hundred flamingos had been killed by the storm, though other estimates ranged as high as several thousand birds.\n\nHurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida.Except for the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned.Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba, but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys.The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States.After surveying the aftermath of Irma, Florida governor Rick Scott said ""I thought we would see more damage""[on the mainland] but said ""he witnessed devastation in the Keys"".President Donald Trump commented on Twitter that the devastation in some places was ""far greater than anyone thought"".\n\nDamage in the United States was estimated at a minimum of $50 billion.At the time, Irma was the fourth costliest tropical cyclone in the United States, behind hurricanes Sandy in 2012, Harvey earlier that year, and Katrina in 2005.However, later in September 2017, Hurricane Maria became the third costliest United States tropical cyclone, causing Irma to fall to the fifth costliest.At least 92 people, 10 directly and 82 indirectly, died throughout the United States in relation to Irma: 84 in Florida, 3 in Georgia, 3 in South Carolina, and 2 in North Carolina.\n\nIrma struck the state less than two weeks after Potential Tropical Cyclone Ten had caused the worst flooding seen in western Florida in 20 years, which further worsened the impacts in the region.The storm\'s large wind field resulted in strong winds across much of Florida, except for the western Panhandle.The highest reported sustained wind speed was on Marco Island, while the strongest observed wind gust was , recorded near Naples, though wind gusts of likely occurred in the Middle Florida Keys.More than 7.7 million homes and businesses in Florida were left without electricity at some point – approximately 73% of state.Generally heavy amounts of rainfall were recorded to the east of the Irma\'s path, including a peak total of in Fort Pierce.Heavy precipitation – and storm surge, in some instances – overflowed at least 32 rivers and creeks, causing significant flooding, particularly along the St. Johns River and its tributaries.Many homes and businesses suffered damage or destruction, with more than 65,000 structures damaged to some degree in West Central and Southwest Florida alone.Agriculture experienced about $2.5 billion in damage.It was estimated that the cyclone caused at least $50 billion in damage, making Irma the costliest hurricane in Florida history, surpassing Hurricane Andrew, until it was itself surpassed by Hurricane Ian, 5 years later.\n\nThroughout Florida, at least 84 people died in storm-related incidents.About half of the deaths occurred from drowning, trauma, and carbon monoxide poisoning.Broward County had 21 fatalities, the most of any county in Florida.Among those deaths were 12 people at The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, a Hollywood nursing home.The patients died from sweltering heat worsened by the lack of air conditioning.The hurricane also left at least 14 deaths in Monroe County; 6 deaths in Orange County; 5 deaths each in Duval, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties; 4 deaths in both Highlands and Hillsborough counties; 3 deaths in both Marion and Polk counties; 2 deaths each in Collier, Hardee, Leon, Pinellas, St. Lucie, and Taylor counties; and 1 death in Hendry, Lake, Lee, Liberty, Manatee, Nassau, Okeechobee, Pasco, Seminole, St. Johns, and Volusia counties.\n\nWith Irma making landfall in Monroe County as a Category 4 hurricane, the Florida Keys were hardest hit area in the state.Strong winds and storm surge flooding caused major damage to buildings, trailer parks, boats, roads, the electricity supply, mobile phone coverage, internet access, sanitation, the water supply and the fuel supply throughout the island chain.An estimated storm surge occurred at Cudjoe Key, where Irma made landfall.Throughout the island, 625 homes sustained minor damage, 52 sustained major damage, and 81 were demolished.On Big Pine Key, one of the most devastated islands, 633 homes received minor impact, 299 homes received major impact, and 473 homes were completely destroyed.Overall in Monroe County, 27,649 homes experienced some degree of damage, including 1,179 homes being destroyed, 2,977 homes receiving major damage, and 5,361 suffering minor damage.\n\nAfter devastating the Keys, the storm then struck Collier County as a Category 3 hurricane.Several communities in the county suffered extensive damage, especially along the coast.Throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, 65 homes, including 44 mobile homes, were demolished, while 1,008 homes received major damage.Property damages in unincorporated areas alone reach about $320 million.Lee County was lashed by strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused prolonged flooding in some areas.More than 24,000 homes suffered some degree of damage, with almost 3,000 homes receiving major damage and 89 homes being destroyed.Damage in the county totaled about $857 million.\n\nImpact in much of the Miami metropolitan area was generally limited to extensive tree and fence damage, as well as widespread power outages.However, in Miami-Dade County, about 1,000 homes received major damage and about 50% of crops were lost.Storm surge caused coastal flooding from Homestead to Downtown Miami, as well as in portions of Miami Beach.Parts of the Florida Heartland were devastated by high winds and flooding, particularly Hendry and Highlands counties.In the former, which has most citrus trees of any county in Florida, about 60% of orange crops were lost.Throughout Hendry County, a total of 451 homes had minor damage, 131 homes suffered major damage, and 42 others were destroyed.In Highlands County, 13,138 businesses and homes were damaged to some degree, with 144 being destroyed, 963 sustaining major damage, and 2,408 receiving minor damage.In Orange County, wind gusts reached 79 mph at Orlando International Airport.A wind gust of 91 mph was also recorded in Orlando at the top of the Disney Contemporary Resort.Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Central Florida left some wind damage and flooding, necessitating evacuations and rescues, including more than 200 people in Orlo Vista after hundreds of homes were flooded.A total of 2,999 business or homes were damaged in Lake County, 7,430 in Seminole County, and 3,457 in Volusia County.Additionally, eight tornadoes touched down in Brevard County, all of which caused damage.\n\nAlong much of the Gulf Coast of Florida, to the north of where Irma made landfall, negative storm surges were observed, with water retracting rather than pushing inland, causing little coastal flooding.However, on the opposite coast, extensive erosion and storm surge flooding occurred in the First Coast, especially in Duval and St. Johns counties.In Duval County, the St. Johns River crested at heights that exceeded records set during Hurricane Dora in 1964.Portions of Jacksonville experienced flooding, particularly the downtown area and the Riverside and San Marco neighborhoods, with about 350 people rescued in those sections of the city.Water reached about high in some homes.The city of Jacksonville suffered about $85 million in damage.\n\nIn St. Johns County, storm surge left extensive damage to oceanfront properties in Ponte Vedra Beach and Vilano Beach, with several becoming uninhabitable.Additionally, some riverfront businesses in St. Augustine\'s historic district were flooded due to storm surge from the Matanzas River.In nearby Clay County, rainfall and storm surge combined to cause extensive flooding along portions of the Black Creek and the St. Johns River, with record high crests at several locations along the former.About 350 people and 75 animals were rescued from floodwaters throughout the county.A total of 275 homes were destroyed, 175 were inflicted major damage, and 124 received minor damage.\n\nThree deaths were reported in Georgia due to falling trees and debris, along with widespread wind damage and power outages throughout the state primarily due to fallen trees.On Tybee Island, as well as St. Simons Island the storm surge caused extensive flooding.The tropical storm also did $54 million in damage in the state.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the third highest storm surge on record was recorded, reaching a height of approximately .By of September 12, almost 100,000 had lost power in Upstate South Carolina.Five people died in storm-related incidents across South Carolina, all from indirect incidents.The tropical storm caused damages totaling $500,000 in the state.\n\nLight damage occurred in other areas, including Tennessee.About 75,000 customers in North Carolina lost power due to Irma.It also caused $600,000 in damages in Alabama.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Irma\'s path through the West Indies and Caribbean, the devastation to roads, harbors and airports significantly impeded the transportation and distribution of relief supplies.Foreign countries moved to provide much of the initial aid.The British, Dutch, French, and United States governments sent warships and planes with supplies and manpower to the region.International leaders, including Dutch King Willem-Alexander and French President Emmanuel Macron, quickly moved to visit affected territories.\n\nSome of the affected countries and territories also offered assistance to each other.Cuba, which sustained extensive damage from the storm, sent 750 health workers to Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, Dominica, and Haiti.Government officials and members of the public in Puerto Rico delivered assistance and evacuated people stranded on other islands.The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services granted special 30-day humanitarian visas for British Virgin Islanders to stay in Puerto Rico.Hundreds of people stranded on Saint Martin were flown to the Dominican Republic on humanitarian grounds.\n\nIn response to Hurricane Jose\'s approach, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a mandatory evacuation on September 9 for any remaining residents on Barbuda.A Miami cargo plane landed on Antigua later that day, carrying over 60 tons (120,000 lbs) of relief supplies for the displaced storm victims—including bottled water, canned food and power generators.\n\nRFA Mounts Bay stationed itself near Anguilla and provided support and relief work to the island with its helicopters and 40 marines and army engineers.The ship delivered 6 tonnes of emergency aid to Anguilla and army engineers repaired a fuel leak at Anguilla\'s main petrol dump, restored power to the island\'s hospital and provided shelters for those left homeless by the hurricane.The ship arrived in the British Virgin Islands on September 8, 2017, to provide emergency relief to the islands, including providing shelters, food and water.HMS Ocean was diverted from the Mediterranean to provide relief from Gibraltar to the affected British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos on September 7, and aid was also supplied by the Department for International Development from their disaster response centre at Kemble Airfield.As part of a £32 million operation named Operation Ruman, nearly 500 UK military personnel with emergency relief were dispatched from RAF Brize Norton.This included the first deployment of No. 38 Expeditionary Air Wing with 3 RAF aircraft; 2 Airbus A400M Atlas and 1 C130J hercules to support relief efforts.\n\nThe British government also drafted 2 members of the UK police calibre into the region on September 10, and 53 police officers were drafted from RAF Brize Norton to the affected British Overseas Territories on September 15 to help maintain order.UK politicians, including the chairs of the foreign affairs and development select committees, criticized both the government\'s preparations for the storm and its response as inadequate.\n\nBy September 12, the Department for International Development had delivered more than 40 tonnes of aid into the region, including into Turks and Caicos, and 1,000 UK military troops were deployed in the region as part of relief efforts.The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, pledged an additional £25 million worth of funding as part of relief efforts in the region on September 13, 2017, and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Boris Johnson, said that a further 250 UK military personnel would be deployed into the area within the next few days.Anguilla\'s Chief Minister, Victor Banks, praised the British government\'s response to the storm and said that Boris Johnson\'s visit to the island ""sends a very positive signal to Anguillans that the British are serious about their response to this very severe hurricane"", but went on to say that the current financial commitment from the UK was not substantial enough.\n\nBy September 15, the United Kingdom had over 70 military personnel and 4 police officers in Anguilla and had delivered 15 tonnes of aid to the island.In the British Virgin Islands, Royal Marines had cleared the airfield so that it was operational for the delivery of aid into the islands, with more than 200 British military personnel and 54 UK police officers on the ground and 8 tonnes of aid delivered to the islands.120 British military personnel were on the ground in Turks and Caicos, and over 150 shelter kits and 720 liters of water were delivered to the islands on September 15.\n\nAmendments to international aid rules by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (or OECD) allowed for the UK government to provide access to £13 billion worth of aid to the affected British Overseas Territories, through the UK\'s Official Development Assistance (ODA) by November 2017.\n\nBy the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage.The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by Irma\'s eye, remained largely inaccessible for days.Assessments showed that 15% of the national telecommunications network had been affected, with at least one tower destroyed.Bahamasair resumed a limited domestic schedule on September 10, with international flights still cancelled due to existing and anticipated destruction at other destinations.\n\nThe worst devastation occurred on Ragged Island, over which Irma\'s eye had directly passed.After days of the National Emergency Management Agency not being able to physically reach the island, officials were finally able to inspect it; they promptly declared it uninhabitable.Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said that it was the worst disaster area he or his officials had ever seen, and that all remaining residents would need to leave, potentially permanently.Business leaders and other officials called for a new long-term development model to shift the population away from such sparsely-settled islands.\n\nOn Grand Bahama and Bimini, where tornadoes associated with Irma touched down on September 10, more than 100 people were left displaced.Infrastructure damage included docks, parks, and the power system.\n\nAside from tangible asset losses, Irma brought significant economic damages.International freight shipping was projected to be offline for a week, and costs for rebuilding supplies were inflated due to demand in the U.S.\n\nSwollen rivers contributed to worsening flooding in the days after the storm system left, resulting in additional evacuations.Officials resorted to using inflatable rafts to access affected areas.The national electrical infrastructure was said to be extensively damaged.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, flooding worsened following Irma\'s departure, leading the number of displaced persons to increase to more than 24,000 by September 8.President Danilo Medina ordered further evacuations due to at-risk dams, while the government banned swimming in rivers and ordered boats kept in port.More than 422,000 people were left without water due to 28 aqueducts being damaged.\n\nIn Haiti, officials stated that losses were greater than they could have been since people largely did not heed early preparation and evacuation warnings.At least 5,000 homes were flooded.One man died trying to cross a flooded river; another went missing and 17 were injured.The trash- and waste-contaminated floodwaters in places like Cap-Haïtien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives led to fears of cholera outbreaks.Flooding continued to worsen days after the storm, as runoff from the mountains swelled rivers in low-lying farming communities.United Nations peacekeepers from Brazil were able to gain access to the flooded northwest region to provide urgent aid, but non-governmental organizations and Haitian economists warned that the estimated 30,000 victims would need longer-term assistance as well.Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant appointed a government commission to address Irma\'s effects, with Action Against Hunger in charge of humanitarian coordination.\n\nIn the USVI, residents and tourists alike were described as being in a state of traumatic shock.By September 7, the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship had arrived in the USVI to provide supplies, damage assessment, and evacuation assistance.Four additional warships, some of which had already been on their way to Texas to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief, were redirected to the region.At a September 10 news conference, Governor Kenneth Mapp described Irma as a ""horrific disaster"" for which ""[t]here will be no restorations or solutions in days or weeks.""The Federal Emergency Management Agency airlifted in goods for residents, who were subjected to a curfew.Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line agreed to transport tourists to Florida, contingent upon port availability following the state\'s own experience with Irma.\n\nOn Saint John, described as ""perhaps the site of Irma\'s worst devastation on American soil,"" it took six days for an active-theater disaster zone to be established, leading to criticism of the U.S. government response.The National Guard was delayed in reaching Saint John due to the number of overturned boats left in the harbor.The National Guard was brought in to maintain order, while the Coast Guard brought evacuees to cruise ships bound for San Juan and Miami.There was still no electricity on St. John in the middle of October 2017.\n\nBy September 9, more than one million Puerto Ricans were still without power, tens of thousands were without water, and several thousand were still in shelters.Hospitals were operating on generator power.The government was struggling to establish contact with the islands of Culebra and Vieques.By September 10, the main island had recovered enough to serve as a refuge for people stranded on other islands, including 1,200 tourists from Saint Martin and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Airlifts had brought more than 50 patients to Puerto Rico.\n\nFive months after Irma, two-thirds of the hospital beds on Saint Thomas were still unavailable, due to extensive physical damage and staffing shortages.\n\nDamage to Sint Maarten\'s harbour and to Princess Juliana International Airport left the Dutch part of Saint Martin unreachable, although the smaller Grand Case-Espérance Airport on the French side could be reopened by September 7 for supply aid by helicopter and airplane.The French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops on board a CASA/IPTN CN-235 aircraft.\n\nThe following day, the Dutch military was able to airlift dialysis patients off the island while also dropping leaflets to warn islanders about the rapidly approaching Hurricane Jose.Although the airport was closed, 435 students and faculty of the American University of the Caribbean were evacuated by the U.S. military.On September 10, Dutch King Willem-Alexander departed for the region, with intentions to visit Sint Maarten and other affected Dutch territories and commonwealth members.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron followed this announcement by stating his intentions to visit the French part of the island on September 12 in order to bring aid supplies.In response to criticism of the French handling of the disaster, 1,000 troops, police, and other emergency workers were sent to Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy.\n\nOn both sides of Saint Martin, desperate conditions combined with food and water shortages in Irma\'s aftermath led to reports of violence, scavenging, and theft.In response, the French government increased its troop deployment to 2,200 and the Dutch government sent more than 600 military and police personnel.\n\nThe day after the hurricane hit Saint Barthelemy the French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops into the reopened Grand Case-Espérance Airport.On September 7 and 9, equipment and personnel were flown from France to Guadeloupe and Martinique.\n\nSporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm.\n\nOn September 11, Florida Governor Rick Scott conducted an aerial tour to survey the damage to the Keys.The Overseas Highway remained closed while authorities assessed the integrity of the 42 bridges along the route.Residents returning to the Keys were faced with a police roadblock, to the south of Florida City.USS Iwo Jima, USS New York and aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were sent to the Keys area to aid with the recovery.\n\nOn September 12, some residents were allowed to return into the Keys as far as Islamorada.Although road damage blocked entry any farther than Islamorada, bridges had been inspected and found safe to Sugarloaf Key.By late on September 12, the Overseas Highway had been repaired and the bridges inspected as safe for first responders to travel to Key West.On September 16, residents were free to return to Marathon.Residents were allowed to return to Key West the following day, although the Keys remained closed to tourists and a checkpoint remained in place in Florida City.\n\nDue mainly to the widespread loss of power, cell phone service was also reduced after battery backup power for cell phone towers ran out and backup generators ran out of fuel.In an impact report by the FCC, as of 11 AM EDT on September 12, 89 of 108 (82%) cell phone towers were non-functioning in Monroe County (Florida Keys), 154 of 212 (73%) were non-functioning in Collier County (Naples), 36 of 46 (78%) were non-functioning in Hendry County, and an additional six counties had 41-60% of cell phone towers not functioning, including Lee County (Fort Myers) and Miami-Dade County.\n\nNOAA released map-format aerial reconnaissance image data of damage from the storm.The imagery featured several areas of Florida: including the Florida Keys, the southwest coast of Florida from Marco Island to Punta Gorda, much of the northeast coast of Florida, and portions of the Jacksonville area.Portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts were also photographed.Additionally, the Sun-Sentinel published before and after photos of several landmarks in the Florida Keys.\n\nIn the days after the hurricane, due to the heavy rainfall, numerous rivers had flooded, including residential areas.Public health risks, such as diarrheal infections and mosquito-borne illnesses, remain from the flooding that resulted in the aftermath of the hurricane.A large concern from flooding is contamination because people become exposed to dirty floodwaters and the potential for contaminated water to enter the local water supply is significant.One example of an illness that can enter the water supply is leptospirosis, which is rat urine carries into the floodwaters.Untreated exposure to leptospirosis can cause kidney damage, meningitis, and liver failure.Noroviruses and other infections are also a risk.\n\nFollowing Irma\'s passage, a hand-carved wooden canoe was discovered on the banks of the Indian River and could be several hundred years old.The state has removed the canoe for examination and safe keeping.\n\nDue to Irma\'s and Hurricane Harvey\'s impact in Florida and Texas, U.S. employment declined in September 2017 for the first time since September 2010.The leisure and hospitality industries were especially hard hit, losing 111,000 jobs in September.\n\nIrma set multiple records for intensity, especially at easterly longitudes, time spent at such an intensity, and its intensity at landfall.When Irma reached Category 5 intensity with winds of at 11:45 UTC on September 5 at 57.7°W, it became the easternmost Atlantic hurricane of this strength on record, surpassing Hurricane David of 1979, later beaten by Hurricane Lorenzo 2 years later.By 00:15 UTC on September 6, Irma reached peak intensity with () winds and a minimum pressure of .This ties it with Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and Hurricane Rita of 2005 as the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed.Only five other Atlantic hurricanes have been recorded with wind speeds higher than Irma: Hurricane Allen of 1980, which had maximum sustained winds of , and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Gilbert of 1988, Hurricane Wilma of 2005, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, all of which had peak winds of .At the time, Irma was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; later surpassed by Hurricane Dorian, and was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007.In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category 5 strength winds, and the third-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, with a value of 64.9 units.Only the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane and Hurricane Ivan in 2004 achieved higher values.\n\nOn September 6, Irma made landfall on the islands of Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Virgin Gorda at peak strength.This ties Irma with cyclones Monica of 2006 and Winston of 2016, and typhoons Zeb of 1998 and Megi of 2010 as the seventh-strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall globally – in terms of sustained winds – trailing only Typhoon Goni of 2020 which bore winds of at landfall, Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 and Typhoon Meranti of 2016, which bore winds of at landfall, and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Typhoon Joan of 1959, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, which bore winds of at landfall.Irma is second to the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin, and is the first hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic at Category 5 status since Felix in 2007.Irma is the first recorded Category 5 hurricane to affect the northern Leeward Islands, and was one of the worst storms to hit the region on record, along with Hurricane Donna in 1960 and Hurricane Luis in 1995.In addition, Irma is only the second hurricane on record to make landfall in Cuba at Category 5 intensity, with the other being a hurricane in 1924.Furthermore, when Irma made landfall on Barbuda, Saint Martin, Virgin Gorda, and Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane, it became one of only two recorded Atlantic storms to make landfall in multiple nations at this strength; the other was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which struck both Eleuthera and the United States as a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nIrma made landfall in the Florida Keys with winds of and a pressure of , making it the strongest hurricane to strike Florida in terms of wind speed since Charley in 2004, and the most intense to strike the state in terms of barometric pressure since Andrew in 1992.In the span of two weeks, two Category 4 hurricanes—Harvey and Irma—struck the continental United States, the first time on record two Atlantic tropical cyclones of such strength made landfall on the country in the same hurricane season.This also marked only the third occurrence of two consecutive Atlantic storms making landfall in the United States as major hurricanes.The other two instances were the Great Charleston and Cheniere Caminada hurricanes in 1893, and hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne in 2004.\n\nBecause of the extensive damage and loss of life the hurricane caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Irma from its rotating naming lists in April 2018, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane.It was replaced with Idalia for the 2023 season.\n\nWeather of 2017 Tropical cyclones in 2017 List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes Operation RUMAN – UK military-civil disaster relief response to Hurricane Irma.List of Cuba hurricanes List

51,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Pokémon Go', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'Pokémon Go (stylized as Pokémon GO) is a 2016 augmented reality (AR) mobile game, part of the Pokémon franchise, developed and published by Niantic in collaboration with Nintendo and The Pokémon Company for iOS and Android devices.It uses mobile devices with GPS to locate, capture, train, and battle virtual Pokémon, which appear as if they are in the player\'s real-world location.The game is free-to-play; it uses a freemium business model combined with local advertising and supports in-app purchases for additional in-game items.The game launched with around 150 species of Pokémon, which had increased to around 700 by 2021.\n\nPokémon Go was released to mixed reviews; critics praised the concept but criticized technical problems.It was one of the most used and profitable mobile apps in 2016, having been downloaded more than 500 million times worldwide by the end of the year.It is credited with popularizing location-based and AR technology, promoting physical activity, and helping local businesses grow due to escalated foot traffic.However, it attracted controversy for contributing to accidents and creating public nuisances.Various governments expressed concerns about security, and some countries regulate its use.The game had over monthly active users by May 2018, over a billion global downloads by early 2019, and grossed more than in revenue by 2020.\n\nAfter establishing a game account, players create and customize their own avatars.Once created, an avatar is displayed on a map based on the player\'s geographical location.Features on the map include \'PokéStops\' and \'Pokémon Gyms\'.These PokéStops can be equipped with items called \'Lure Modules\', which attract additional wild, and occasionally rare, Pokémon.Gyms serve as battle locations for team-based king of the hill matches.PokéStops and Gyms are typically located at places of interest.These locations were initially re-purposed portals from Ingress, Niantic\'s previous augmented reality (AR) game.This has led to PokéStops and Pokémon Gyms being placed at dangerous or inconvenient locations, such as a now-deleted Gym at the Korean Demilitarized Zone and Bagram Airforce Base, which was abandoned by U.S. forces in July 2021.Since 2019, these locations also include submissions from Go players which are largely reviewed by other players.\n\nAs players move within their real world surroundings, their avatars move within the game\'s map.Different Pokémon species reside in different areas of the world; for example, Water-type Pokémon are generally found near water.When a player encounters a Pokémon, it may be viewed either in AR mode or with a live rendered, generic background.AR mode uses the camera and gyroscope on the player\'s mobile device to display an image of a Pokémon as though it were in the real world.Players can take screenshots of the Pokémon they encounter either with or without the AR mode activated.\n\nAlthough the game is free to play, it supports in-app purchases, where players can purchase additional Poké Balls and other in-game items.These items include Incense, which attracts Pokémon to the player as they move for sixty minutes, Lure Modules, which players use at PokéStops to attract Pokémon to their current location near the PokeStop, and Lucky Eggs, which double experience points gained for a thirty-minute period from use.All Pokémon are displayed with a Combat Power, which is a rough measure of how powerful that Pokémon is in battle.Generally, as players level up, they catch Pokémon with higher CP and Pokémon are somewhat harder to catch.The player can check how strong their Pokémon are by the ""Appraisal"" system.\n\nPlayers can customize their avatar\'s appearance with clothing options that differ in availability according to season, player level, and game sponsors.Clothing includes: hats, accessories, tops, bottoms, socks, footwear and bags.Most clothing aligns with either the look of a specific Pokémon, a specific team and/or Pokémon region.Many pieces of clothing are free, but pieces can also be purchased using coins, earned during select events, awarded as the player levels up, or received as a prize for special research completion.\n\nAnother way for a player to customize their avatar is with a pose.Poses, like clothing, are free, purchased, or awarded.Certain poses are event based and can only be earned during the event they are attached to.Once the event is over, there is no guarantee that the pose will be available in-game again.\n\nIn April 2024, Pokémon GO was updated to allow greater customization of player avatars.Customization now includes a limited number of different hair styles, the ability to adjust the weight of the avatar, and expanded options for skin color.This update was met with mass backlash from the playerbase, as the new avatars were perceived to be of inferior graphical quality in comparison to the outgoing models, and because the updated models interfered with some pre-update cosmetic items, of which many had been purchased by players.\n\nUnlike most other installments in the Pokémon series, players in Pokémon Go do not battle wild Pokémon to catch them.During an encounter with a wild Pokémon, a player may throw a Poké Ball at it by flicking it from the bottom of the screen up toward the Pokémon.If the Pokémon is caught, it will come under the ownership of the player.Factors in the success rate of catching a Pokémon include the Pokémon\'s catch rate, the timing, the type of Poké Ball used, etc.After catching a wild Pokémon, the player is awarded two types of in-game currencies: Candies and Stardust.The Candies awarded by a successful catch depend on what evolutionary chain a Pokémon belongs to.A player can use Stardust and Candies to raise a Pokémon\'s level and hence ""Combat Power"" (CP).However, only Candies are needed to evolve a Pokémon, except for certain Pokémon that might need special items.Each Pokémon evolution tree has its own type of Candy, which can only be used to evolve or level up.The maximum level a player can achieve was originally level 40, but expanded to 50 as of November 30, 2020.The player can also transfer the Pokémon back to the Pokémon Professor Willow to earn more Candies and create room for more Pokémon.Shiny Pokémon are available through multiple ways, mostly by chance.One popular goal of the game is to complete the entries in the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon logbook, by catching and evolving them to collect every one in it.\n\nIn September 2016, Niantic introduced a ""Buddy Pokémon"" feature, which allows players to pick a Pokémon to appear alongside them on the profile screen, and receive in-game rewards and bonuses based on the chosen Pokémon.The feature was released later that month.Certain Pokémon have different distances that they need to be walked in order to receive candy.The more the player walks in real time, the more candy they can earn.During the same update, Niantic made it impossible for players with rooted or jailbroken devices to log into the game in an effort to reduce and prevent cheating.\n\nOn January 20, 2018, Pokémon Go held the first Community Day, a monthly event that increases the appearance rate of a specific Pokémon and offer an exclusive move to the final evolution of the featured Pokémon only if caught or evolved during the event window.Players also have a higher chance to catch the Shiny variant of the featured Pokémon.The first Community Day featured Pikachu, with the exclusive move Surf to Raichu.\n\nThe game is regularly updated with new Pokémon, and as of March 25, 2022, there are just over 730 Pokémon in the game (not including regional varieties) out of a total 1008.\n\nRegional Pokémon are often released together, such as Hoenn region Pokémon released in December 2017, Alolan variants in May 2018, Sinnoh region Pokémon(along with the Sinnoh Stone item used to evolve them) released in October 2018, Unova region Pokémon (and the Unova Stone) in September 2019, Kalos region Pokémon in December 2020, and again more Alola region Pokémon in March 2022.\n\nMythical and legendary Pokémon are often released individually (or in pairs/trios) in special events or quests.The first Legendary Pokémon released was Groudon, in December 2017.The Mythical Pokémon Meltan and its evolved form, Melmetal are so far the only Pokémon to have made their debut on Pokémon Go.Their release coincided with the release of Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee!on the Nintendo Switch, Pokémon Go introduced the new Mythical Pokémon Meltan originally as a teaser, later to be available to capture only in Pokémon Go via a ""Mystery Box"" item that could be obtained through transferring Pokémon from Pokémon Go to either Nintendo Switch Pokémon games, or by completing new Research Tasks.\n\nIn August 2020, Mega Evolution came to Pokémon Go with four Pokémon able to Mega Evolve into five forms.\n\nPlayers earn experience points for various in-game activities.Players rise in level as they earn experience points (XP), with various features being progressively unlocked.Most-notably, at level five, the player can battle at a Pokémon Gym and join one of three color-coded teams (red for Team Valor, blue for Team Mystic, or yellow for Team Instinct), which act as factions battling for control of Gyms within the Pokémon Go world.\n\nIn June 2017, Niantic announced that the game mechanics of Gyms would be revamped for a more teamwork-oriented experience; Gyms were disabled on June 19, 2017, with the new Gyms being released with the next app update a few days later.As of the update, Gyms included a spinnable component to receive in-game items such as Potions and Poké Balls.Additionally, Gyms are capped at containing six Pokémon, each of which must be unique in that Gym.Coins are now earned based on the amount of time the defending Pokémon has been in a Gym, as opposed to a one-per-day gym defender bonus of 10 coins per current defending Pokémon.Legendary, Mythical and Buddy Pokémon cannot be placed in Gyms.\n\nIn July 2017, Raid Battles were introduced.Raid Battles consist of a group of players gathering to confront an over-leveled Pokémon located in a Gym.If the Pokémon is defeated, the players gain the chance to catch a regular version of it.Raid difficulties range from 1 to 5, with 1 being of the lowest difficulty, and 5 being the most difficult to defeat.Level 5 raids are exclusive to Legendary Pokémon.The first of these, Articuno and Lugia, were released on July 22, 2017, after the Go Fest, with Moltres and Zapdos following.From September to November, the 3 Legendary Beasts: Entei, Raikou and Suicune, were released shortly after, rotating regions every month.Following their departure, the Legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh appeared in Raid Battles from November 27, 2017, to December 12, 2017.In August 2020, level 3 Mega raids arrived with the introduction of Mega Evolution.At the same time, Level 2 and 4 raids were combined into Level 1 and 3 raids.\n\nIn May 2022, Raid Battle were updated to include the addition of Mega Legendary Pokémon, which were turned to 6 stars, the highest currently in the game.The only Pokémon included in these Raids were Mega Latios and Mega Latias.\n\nIn October 2022, a new form of raid battle called ""Elite Raids"" were introduced.Elite Raids differ to normal raids in a number of ways, most notably that they can only be battled in person, take 24 hours to start, and are extremely difficult, often requiring a large number of players to defeat the Pokémon.\n\nIn May 2023, another new form of raid battles were introduced called ""Shadow Raids"".Shadow Raids may only be battled in person and award the chance to catch a Shadow Pokémon upon defeat.During the battle, the Pokémon may become ""enraged"", increasing both attack and defence, but can be returned to normal using a ""Purified Gem"".\n\nIn December 2018, Niantic added player vs player Trainer Battles.In January 2020, Niantic rolled out an online battle format Go Battle League which allows players to fight other players worldwide.Unlike the Trainer Battles format introduced in 2018, Go Battle League does not require physical proximity, scanning QR code on each other\'s phone, knowing each other\'s friend code, or any other real-world interactions between players.Instead, participating players are automatically paired by the game server via some variant of the Elo rating system.\n\nIn July 2019, Pokémon Go introduced Team GO Rocket battles.Team GO Rocket NPCs could be battled at PokéStops indicated with it twitching and being a dark color or in Team GO Rocket Balloons which follow the player on the map.After victory, the player has the opportunity to capture a ""Shadow Pokémon"" which are relatively low-leveled, angry-looking Pokémon.Shadow Pokémon have a higher attack stat but a lower defense stat than a normal Pokémon.After capture, the player can choose to purify the Shadow Pokémon.Purified Pokémon are higher-leveled than their Shadow counterparts, can learn an exclusive move when purified, and need fewer candies to evolve.\n\nThe concept for the game was conceived in 2014 by Satoru Iwata of Nintendo and Tsunekazu Ishihara of The Pokémon Company as an April Fools\' Day collaboration with Google, called the Google Maps: Pokémon Challenge.Ishihara was a fan of developer Niantic\'s previous transreality game, Ingress, and saw the game\'s concept as a perfect match for the Pokémon series.Niantic, a subsidiary of Google, used the crowdsourced data from Ingress to populate the locations for PokéStops and gyms within Pokémon Go, data from Google Maps to spawn specific Pokémon on certain terrain, and map display from OpenStreetMap since December 2017.The game\'s application logic uses the open source Kubernetes system - and due to the game\'s sheer scale of users, a number of bugs with the Kubernetes system was discovered and later fixed.Niantic was spun off from Google as an independent company in 2015 following the company reorganization into Alphabet Inc.\n\nIn 2015, Ishihara dedicated his speech at the game\'s announcement on September 10 to Iwata, who had died two months earlier.Tatsuo Nomura, who joined Niantic in 2015 after he developed the Google Maps Pokémon Challenge, acted as Director and Product Manager for the game.The game\'s soundtrack was written by longtime Pokémon series composer, Junichi Masuda, who also assisted with some of the game\'s design.Among the game\'s graphic designers was Dennis Hwang, who previously created the logo of Gmail while working for Google.\n\nOn March 4, 2016, Niantic announced a Japan-exclusive beta test would begin later that month, allowing players to assist in refining the game before its full release.The beta test was later expanded to other countries.On April 7, it was announced that the beta would expand to Australia and New Zealand.Then, on May 16, the signups for the field test were opened to the United States.The test came to an end on June 30.\n\nAt the Comic-Con 2016, John Hanke, founder of Niantic, revealed the appearances of the three team leaders: Candela (Team Valor), Blanche (Team Mystic), and Spark (Team Instinct).Hanke conveyed that approximately 10% of the ideas for the game were implemented.Future updates, including the addition of trading, more Pokémon, implementation of Pokémon Centers at PokéStops, a patch for the ""three step glitch"", and easier training, were also confirmed.He also stated that Niantic would be continuing support for the game for ""years to come"".In an interview with TechCrunch in September 2016, Hanke hinted that player vs. player Pokémon battles would be released in a future update.In December 2016, coffeehouse chain Starbucks and telecommunications company Sprint collaborated with Nintendo to add PokéStops and gyms at certain locations of theirs throughout the United States.That same month, a companion app for Apple Watch devices was released, which allows users to receive notifications about nearby Pokémon, but does not allow for them to be caught.In January 2017, an additional 5,000 more Starbucks locations became available as gyms.In February 2017, an update was released which introduced over 100 species based in the Johto region from the second generation of the core Pokémon series, which were added alongside the original 151.The update also included the addition of new berries, new Pokémon encounter mechanics, and an expanded selection of avatar clothing options.Some of the Pokémon introduced in Ruby and Sapphire were added in late 2017, starting with a Halloween event in October and 50 more in December.A weather system was added alongside the latter, allowing real-world weather to affect gameplay.In November 2018, a game developed by Game Freak and heavily inspired by Pokémon Go, Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee! was released on the Nintendo Switch.This game will feature Pokémon Go style catching with Joy-Con and there has integration between the two games.In addition, new Pokémon Meltan was revealed in September, becoming the first new Pokémon to be released through Pokémon Go.On October 10, 2018, The Pokémon Company and Niantic announced plans to introduce Pokémon from Diamond and Pearl into Pokémon Go.On October 12, Niantic teased one of the Generation IV Pokémon that would be coming to Pokémon Go.On October 25, a feature known as Adventure Sync was announced, which will record the player\'s walking data in the background.On October 26, Niantic announced research tasks for Bug type Pokémon that will give players a chance to catch Shedinja throughout November.\n\nAccording to John Hanke in a January 2019 interview with Business Insider, 2018 saw Go become the game initially envisioned by Niantic.\n\nIn 2020, Niantic made major changes to gameplay mechanisms to account for the COVID-19 pandemic which saw many players unable to leave their homes to play.These development shift saw changes like the addition of indoor step tracking to count toward in-game distance challenges, long distance PVP battles, increased ""incense"" effectiveness, increased spawn points, and a doubled player radius.\n\nThe Pokémon Go Plus is a Bluetooth Low Energy wearable device, developed by Nintendo\'s Platform Technology Development division, that allows players to perform certain actions in the game without looking at their smart device.When a player is near a Pokémon or PokéStop, the Plus vibrates.The player can then press the button to capture the Pokémon or receive items from the PokéStop; the player cannot check what they have received until the next time they sign into the app onto their mobile device.The design consists of a Poké Ball and the shape of the Google Maps pin.The decision to create the device rather than create a smartwatch app was to increase uptake among players for whom a smartwatch is prohibitively expensive.It was released in the United Kingdom and North America on September 16, 2016.\n\nThe game\'s official launch began on July 6, 2016, with releases in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.Due to server strain from high demand upon release, Niantic CEO John Hanke stated that the release in other regions was to be ""paused until Niantic was comfortable"" fixing the issues.European releases started on July 13, and the game became available to most of the continent over the following ten days.The Japanese launch was initially reported to be on July 20; however, the game was delayed after a sponsorship deal with fast food chain McDonald\'s was leaked, instead releasing two days later.Although the game was proposed to be released in France on July 15, it was postponed until July 24 out of respect and due to safety concerns following a terrorist attack in Nice on July 14.Following the shut down of third-party apps and websites in late-July 2016—significantly reducing server strain—Niantic was able to continue pushing release worldwide.Central and South America and most of Southeast Asia subsequently saw releases in early August.Indonesia was the first Asian country to have the game playable, despite the game not being officially released in that region until August 6.\n\nIn South Korea, the game was not officially released as major restrictions on the use of online mapping data exist.However, due to a glitch, a small area around Sokcho in the northeastern part of the country was considered a part of Niantic\'s North Korea mapping region, making the game fully playable in that area.Numerous people took advantage of the gap to play the game.Bus tickets from the capital city of Seoul sold out and people living within Sokcho shared information on free Wi-Fi areas to tourists.Players also discovered a gym in Panmunjom, along the Korean Demilitarized Zone; however, Niantic later removed it from the game.Following the release of Pokémon Go in Japan, parts of Busan also became playable as parts of the city are considered part of Japan\'s mapping area due to the proximity of Tsushima Island.The game officially released in the country in January 2017.\n\nIn mainland China, Google services are banned by the Great Firewall, whereas the GPS function in the game is blocked by Niantic.Players of Pokémon Go in China have to download the game with App Store IDs from other regions and use VPN to access Google services in order to load the game, and some even use a GPS spoofing app to bypass the GPS blocking.Some players also downloaded a clone app called City Spirit Go, which was released shortly after Pokémon Go beta test in Japan.As of 2020, the official game is still unplayable in most parts of China with GPS modules being blocked in-game.\n\nDuring its launch in Southeast Asia in August 2016, the game officially excluded Myanmar, but users in Thailand discovered that the game was fully playable in border cities near the nation.The game was released in the Balkans, Macau, and Central Asia in September 2016, and was also released throughout Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia by the end of the year.\n\nOn September 11, 2018, the game appeared in Russia\'s App Store and Google Play Store over two years after the first launch.However, Niantic did not officially announce the release.\n\nIn May 2019, the game was released on the Samsung Galaxy Store.\n\nInvestors were buoyed by the response to the initial release of Pokémon Go on July 7, with Nintendo\'s share price rising by an initial 10% and by July 14 shares rose to as high as 50%.Despite Nintendo only owning a 32% stake in The Pokémon Company and an undisclosed stake in Niantic, Nintendo\'s market value increased by US$9 billion within five days of release of Pokémon Go.The trend continued for more than a week after the game\'s release and by July 19, the stock value of Nintendo more than doubled as compared to pre-release.Turnover sales reached a record-breaking ¥703.6 billion (US$6.6 billion); and trading of the stock accounted for a quarter of all trades on the Tokyo Stock Exchange\'s main board.The Financial Times believed that investors were speculating not on Pokémon Go as such, but on future Nintendo app releases being as successful as the company moves more into the mobile app market—an area they were historically reluctant to enter in the belief it would cannibalise its portable console and video game sales.Nintendo plans to release four more smartphone app games by March 2017, and investors remarked that Pokémon Go showed Nintendo still has some of the ""most valuable character intellectual property in the world"" with franchises such as Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid.\n\nBy July 22, Nintendo gained ¥1.8 trillion ($17.6 billion) in market capitalization since the game\'s launch.However, following clarification from Nintendo that the company did not produce Pokémon Go nor had tangible financial gains from it, its stock fell by 18%—equating to a ¥708 billion ($6.7 billion) loss in market value—on July 25.This was the largest single-day decline for Nintendo since 1990 and the maximum one-day exchange of finances allowed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.The company has an approximate 13% ""effective economic stake"" in the game, according to Macquarie Securities.\n\nThe surge in stocks extended beyond Nintendo, with Tomy, TV Tokyo, and the Bank of Kyoto, among other companies, all seeing significant gains.Similarly, Zagg, which owns a company that manufactures battery cases, saw a 25% rise in its stock in relation to Pokémon Go.\n\nAt launch, the game suffered from frequent server outages due to extreme usage.The global server usage expectation for the game was surpassed within 15 minutes of the game\'s release in Australia and New Zealand, and peaked at 50 times expected traffic, or 10 times the expected worst-case scenario.Frequent crashes and authentication errors plagued the game\'s release and persisted for several days.For the first two days after launch, players were unable to access the game through their Pokémon Trainer Club accounts; only Gmail-based accounts were able to gain access to the game.Servers again suffered frequent outages in Australia on July 11; players blamed people in the United Kingdom for bypassing local servers and using Australian ones to play the game before its official release.On July 16, a few hours after the release in many European countries, the game\'s servers temporarily went down.The outage was claimed by a hacking group called ""PoodleCorp"", who said they used a DDoS attack to take them down, although the problem was fixed later that day.The next day, the servers went down again as the game was launched in Canada.John Hanke issued an apology for the server issues at San Diego Comic Con 2016, stating ""we weren\'t provisioned for what happened"".\n\nSome early iOS installs of Pokémon Go required users to provide the app with full access to their Google accounts, thereby allowing the app to ""access players\' Gmail-based email, Google Drive-based files, photos and videos stored in Google Photos, and any other content within their Google accounts"".The Pokémon Company and Niantic responded to the concerns, recognizing that the iOS app, at the time, ""... erroneously requests full access permission for the user\'s Google account ...""However, Adam Reeve—the person who initially made claims of the security issues in a Tumblr post—later backtracked on his claim and was not ""100 percent sure"" it was valid.Dan Guido, CEO of the security company Trail of Bits, analyzed the app\'s programming and discovered that although the game did request full account access, this did not enable third-party usage as initially conveyed.Guido found that this did enable Niantic to access people\'s email addresses and phone numbers unintentionally.A subsequent iOS app update reduced the scope of access.Niantic also issued a statement assuring users that no information was collected nor was any information beyond what was necessary to use the app accessed.\n\nAlongside server issues, Pokémon Go suffered from several glitches.One of the more prominent bugs appeared in mid-July 2016 and rendered the game\'s tracking feature useless.Normally, this feature shows between zero and three footprints to inform the player of how close they are to a nearby Pokémon; however, it universally became ""stuck"" at three steps, earning it the name ""three-step-glitch"".Niantic removed the footstep feature altogether on July 30, sparking criticism from players.By August 1, players reported a new glitch that swaps their captured Pokémon with another creature at random.Another bug, confirmed by Niantic in August, inadvertently made capturing Pokémon more difficult.Some legendary Pokémon, which are rare and powerful versions of the creatures, were also obtained by players in a glitch, though they were later removed from the accounts of the trainers to keep the game fair.\n\nPokémon Go released to ""mixed or average"" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.Upon release, critics called the experience enjoyable, but noted the game\'s technical issues.\n\nCritics praised various aspects of Pokémon Go.Oscar Dayus (Pocket Gamer) said that the game was an immensely enjoyable experience and continued with how ""the very personal nature of catching Pokémon in your own neighborhood made me smile more than any game has for years"".Jeremy Parish (US Gamer) compared the game and its social aspects to a massively multiplayer online game.Reviewers also praised the game enabling the promotion of physical exercise.Terri Schwartz (IGN) said it was ""secretly the best exercise app out there"" and that it changed her daily walking routine.Patrick Allen (Lifehacker) wrote an article with tips about how to work out using Pokémon Go.Julia Belluz (Vox) said it could be the ""greatest unintentional health fad ever"" and wrote that one of the results of the game that the developers may not have realized was that ""it seems to be getting people moving"".Users took an extra 194 steps per day once they started using the app, which approximated to 26% more than usual.IGN named it the 100th best video game of all time in 2018.\n\nPhilip Kollar and Allegra Frank (Polygon) both agreed that Pokémon Go was ""an exciting social experience"", but were not sure how long the game and its popularity would last, stating it could either last for coming years or ""end up as a brush fire craze that the whole gaming world is talking about for a few weeks and then is forgotten"".\n\nOther critics expressed more negative opinions of the game, with many citing frequent crashes and other technical issues, along with shallow gameplay.Kallie Plagge (IGN) said that although the game lacked in polish and depth, the overall experience made up for it.Matt Peckham (Time) criticized the game for its frequent crashes.Mike Cosimano (Destructoid) also took issue with the game, saying the original idea showed promise, but was improperly executed.Kat Brewster (The Guardian) wrote that although she thought Pokémon Go was not a good game, it was ""a great experience"".The server problems also received negative press.Miguel Concepcion (GameSpot) said that although he enjoyed the game\'s strong social appeal and visual design, the game\'s ""initial iteration is a buggy mess on all levels"", with one of the reasons being the constant server problems.Another glitch that appeared a few days after launch was the ""three-step glitch"", which made it impossible to ""hunt down a specific Pokémon"".Patricia Hernandez (Kotaku) said, ""the three step glitch adds to what has been a terrible launch for Pokémon Go"".Critics also emphasized on the large gap between the rural and urban players.Rural players seem to be at a major disadvantage when playing the game, while city players have access to more PokéStops and Gyms.\n\nPokémon Go rapidly rose the American iOS App Store\'s ""Top Grossing"" and ""Free"" charts.The game has become the fastest game to top the App Store and Google Play, beating Clash Royale, and it became the most downloaded app on the App Store of any app in their first week.Within two days of release, it was installed on more than 5% of Android devices in the United States, according to SimilarWeb, According to Sensor Tower, the game was downloaded more than 10 million times within a week of release, becoming the fastest such app to do so, and reached 15 million global downloads by July 13.According to SurveyMonkey the game became the most active mobile game in the United States ever with 21 million active users on July 12, eclipsing Candy Crush Sagas peak of 20 million.By July 15, approximately 1.3 million people were playing the game in the Netherlands, despite the app not being officially released in the country at the time.On the day of release in Japan, more than 10 million people downloaded the game, including 1.3 million in the first three hours.By July 31, the game exceeded 100 million downloads worldwide, according to App Annie and Sensor Tower.On August 8, Pokémon Go reached the milestone of over 100 million downloads on Google Play alone after barely 33 days on the market.\n\nThrough in-game purchases, the game generated more than by the end of July 2016, with App Annie reporting that Pokémon Go had generated around in revenue every day that month.The same month, Sensor Tower reported that the game had passed more than in worldwide revenue, beating every existing record set by Clash of Clans and Candy Crush by a wide margin.On August 12, 2016, the Financial Times reported that Pokémon Go reached in revenue after five weeks counting only the U.S., British, and German markets.The average daily usage of the app on Android devices in July 2016 exceeded that of Snapchat, Tinder, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.Due by the game\'s massive popularity, several app developers became focused on developing similar AR apps using available software development kits (SDK).By September 2, 2016, Pokémon Go had generated more than $440 million in worldwide revenue, according to Sensor Tower.By September 30, it had received downloads and grossed in 80 days, according to market research firm Newzoo.Pokémon Go reached the milestone of $600 million in revenue after only 90 days on the market, becoming the fastest mobile game ever to do so.\n\nBesides in-game purchases, partnerships with retail chains like Starbucks, McDonald\'s, Sprint, pay Niantic Labs for ""Foot Traffic"" on-demand of the retail shops.\n\nThe game was awarded five Guinness World Records in August 2016: most revenue grossed by a mobile game in its first month (); most downloaded mobile game in its first month (130 million downloads); most international charts topped simultaneously for a mobile game in its first month (top game in 70 different countries); most international charts topped simultaneously for a mobile game in its first month (top grossing in 55 countries simultaneously); and fastest time to gross $100 million by a mobile game (reached in 20 days on July 26).By September 2016, Pokémon Go had been downloaded over 500 million times worldwide, and became the fastest game to make over $500 million in revenue.Pokémon Go was awarded the App Store\'s breakout hit of 2016.Pokémon Go was reported to be the most searched game on Google in 2016.\n\nUsage of the game in the United States peaked on July 15, and by mid-September, had lost 79% of its players there.Forbes said ""the vaguely curious stopped playing and the more committed players ran up against a fairly unsatisfying endgame"".In October 2016, Niantic released a Halloween-themed event, which saw a surge in revenue up to 133% as reported by Sensor Tower, placing the game back to top of the charts of highest grossing apps.It was reported that the game earned approximately $23.3 million between October 25 and 29, up from approximately $10 million between October 18 and 22.According to App Annie, Pokémon Go grossed an estimated in 2016.\n\nIn February 2017, Pokémon Go was awarded being the best app at the Crunchies award event.By February 2017, the game has been downloaded more than times worldwide, with a reported in revenue made, becoming the fastest mobile game ever to do so.By June 2017, the game was downloaded more than 750 million times, with an estimated revenue of according to Apptopia.According to mobile app research firm Apptopia, approximately 60 million users were still playing the game a year after launch.In May 2018, The Pokémon Company announced that the game reached over 800million downloads worldwide.Forbes estimated that the game may have come close to 900million downloads by September 2018.The top five countries where it has received the most downloads are the United States (21%), Brazil (9.3%), India (8.6%), Mexico (5.5%), and Indonesia (5%).As of February 2019, the game has been downloaded by over 1billion people worldwide.\n\nA report from SuperData Research ranked Pokémon Go as the 9th highest grossing mobile game of 2017, with an annual revenue of .Bloomberg estimated that Pokémon Go generated up to in total revenue by late 2017.Two years from its initial launch, analyst firm Sensor Tower estimated the game had grossed over from in-app purchases, reporting that players around the world continue to spend each day.SuperData Research reported that, in May 2018, Pokémon Go grossed in monthly revenue and had monthly active players, its highest since Summer 2016.In July 2018, Pokémon Go was the top-grossing mobile app of the month.Since the introduction of trading and friends features, Sensor Tower has reported that players spend an average of per day.Apptopia reported that, by September 2018, the game had grossed over from in-app purchases; the top five countries where it has received the most revenue are Japan (), the United States (), Germany (), the United Kingdom (), and Australia ().It was the fourth highest-grossing game of 2018, with , and in 2019 alone Pokémon Go earned , according to Superdata Research, a division of Nielsen Media Research.Pokémon Go live events earned in tourism revenue during 2019.According to Sensor Tower in November 2020, Pokémon Go had accumulated nearly unique installs and generated almost in revenue from in-game purchases via the iOS App Store and Google Play.Its largest market in terms of both installs and revenue is the United States, followed by Japan and Germany in revenue and by Brazil and Mexico in installs.\n\nDuring 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic causing restrictions on the ability of players to play Go outside their homes, Niantic implemented new features which allowed players to play the game from inside their homes, and this was credited with increasing its playerbase throughout the year despite the restrictions.Despite a brief drop early in the pandemic, the number of monthly active users of the game rose by 45 percent between January and August 2020, and the game\'s revenue in 2020 was the highest in its history, exceeding even its 2016 revenue.The game generated more than of revenue in the first 10 months of 2020 according to Sensor Tower, and it was the top-grossing mobile game of December 2020.Pokémon Go was one of the top five highest-grossing games of 2020 with an annual revenue of according to SuperData Research, bringing the game\'s cumulative revenue to by 2020.The game generated a further in the first half of 2021.\n\nThe game was referred to as a ""social media phenomenon"" which has brought people together from all walks of life.231 million people engaged in 1.1 billion interactions that mentioned Pokémon Go on Facebook and Instagram in the month of July.Numerous media outlets referred to the surge in popularity as ""Pokémon Go Mania"", or simply ""Pokémania"".The massive popularity of the game resulted in several unusual positive effects.For example, the game placed players where they can help catch criminals and report crimes in progress, although it has also placed some in harm\'s way, and has even aided law enforcement\'s community relations, albeit with caveats.Businesses also benefited from the nearby presence of PokéStops (or them being PokéStops themselves) with the concomitant influx of people, and the intense exploration of communities has brought local history to the forefront.The game was also seen bringing its players to places of worship, as many Pokégyms are located there.Despite some criticism by religious leaders, this was received positively by religious groups, who saw it as reminding adherents to come and pray.Some establishments considered purchasing lures in the game to attract additional players to PokéStops on their property.Within a week of its release, a secondary market emerged for the game, both for the resell of high-level accounts on Craigslist and PlayerUp, and for the sale of expert advice on Thumbtack.Wireless provider T-Mobile US started an offer for free data for a year for Pokémon Go sessions, and Yelp added a filter that only shows businesses which have a PokéStop nearby.National parks across the United States saw an influx of visitors due to the game, with ""hundreds or thousands"" of people visiting the National Mall and Memorial Parks in Washington, D.C. on the weekend following Pokémon Go release in the country.Small museums with PokéStops placed at exhibits also reported increased attendance, such as the McNay Art Museum in San Antonio, Texas, and the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens in Boca Raton, Florida.Charity organizations also sought engagement from players, with animal shelters offering dog walks to people who want to hatch eggs.\n\nEduardo Paes, then-mayor of Rio de Janeiro, stated that he hoped the app would be released in Brazil before the start of the 2016 Summer Olympics in the city (and it was, on August 3), and United States presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton mentioned the app during their 2016 election campaigns.In late July 2016, during a public address, the President of Italy, Sergio Mattarella, compared a political issue about the date of an incoming referendum as preposterous as the hunt for the Pokémon.Shortly after the game\'s release, Bellator mixed martial artist Michael Page celebrated a knockout of his match opponent, Evangelista Santos by putting on a red Ash Ketchum-like hat and rolling a prop Poké Ball in Santos\'s direction.On July 25, Dwayne Johnson released a promo video featuring MatPat and Ali-A with himself as a tough, rare Pokémon.\n\nThe game was credited for popularizing AR, and was praised by genderfluid groups for letting the players choose a ""style"" instead of ""gender"".The game also had a positive impact among individuals with autism.The ""Pokémon Theme"" from the animated series saw a 630% increase in listeners on music streaming platform Spotify during the month of the game\'s release.Meanwhile, streaming services such as Hulu experienced an increased viewership of the Pokémon series and films.Nintendo reported that sales of the 3DS Pokémon games rose as a result of the game\'s popularity.A Twitch channel, Twitch Plays Pokémon Go, was created that mimics the crowd-played Twitch Plays Pokémon channel, allowing viewers to direct a virtual avatar in the game using an iPhone programmed to spoof its location.Niantic later issued permanent bans to those who cheated the game by means such as GPS spoofing and bots.Pokémon-themed pornography increased in popularity after the release of the game.xHamster, an adult video streaming website, reported that within 5 days of the game\'s release, Pokémon related terms were the most searched for videos.Another adult video streaming website, Pornhub, reported that Pokémon related searches spiked 136%.Pokémon Go was spoofed in the Maroon 5 music video, ""Don\'t Wanna Know"".In the 2016 Doctor Who Christmas special, ""The Return of Doctor Mysterio"", the Doctor creates a distraction by ""flood[ing] the downstairs with Pokémon"", causing the people to run off with their cell phones.In the episode ""Looking for Mr. Goodbart"" from the 28th season of The Simpsons, the people of Springfield become addicted to Peekimon Get, a parody of Pokémon Go.\n\nGos release resulted in a resurgence in popularity for the Pokémon franchise as a whole.The Pokémon Sun and Moon games for the Nintendo 3DS, released later in 2016, was the best-selling video game for the 3DS with over 16 million copies sold, and this was partly attributed to the new fans to the series brought in by Go.In an interview, director of Sun and Moon Shigeru Ohmori remarked that the Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon sequels were designed partly to facilitate entry for newcomers to the franchise brought in by Go.The first Pokémon games for the Nintendo Switch, Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee!, took significant inspirations from Go.A line of official Go merchandise was released in November 2019.\n\nIn addition to standard gameplay, the game has held several in-game and live events.The first live event officially held by Niantic was held in Charlotte, North Carolina, in May 2017.In July 2017, a community event was held in Grant Park, Chicago, in honor of the first anniversary of the game\'s release.Despite the fact that almost no information about the event, including ticket prices and attractions, was released by Niantic ahead of the ticket sale, over 20,000 tickets sold out within a half hour.During the event itself, attendees suffered connectivity issues and crashes, due to the heavy amount of localized cellular activity.Afterwards, Niantic announced that they would refund everybody who bought a ticket, as well as give them $100 of in-game currency.Following the event, around two dozen attendees filed suit against Niantic, seeking travel reimbursement.\n\nFollowing the event in Chicago, other events have been held in Chester, Yokohama, and San Jose.In September 2017, a series of events named ""Safari Zone"" was held in Unibail-Rodamco shopping centers in Oberhausen, Paris and Barcelona, with events the following month in Copenhagen, Prague, Stockholm and Amstelveen.\n\nIn January 2018, Niantic announced monthly community event Community Day which aims to get players to meet up in their local areas.During a multi-hour period, players can encounter more frequent wild spawns of a particular Pokémon, an exclusive move for that Pokémon (or its evolution), an increased probability for the shiny form of that Pokémon, and bonuses such as extra stardust or XP.The Community Days in 2018 featured Pikachu (January 20), Dratini (February 24), Bulbasaur (March 25), Mareep (April 15), Charmander (May 19), Larvitar (June 16), Squirtle (July 8), Eevee (August 11–12), Chikorita (September 22), Beldum (October 21), and Cyndaquil (November 10).\n\nPokémon Go in Syria is a photography series published in 2016 by Syrian artist Khaled Akil.Akil places Pokémon characters in destroyed Syrian streets as a reminder for a world lost behind the screen.While Pokémon Go was trending worldwide, Akil couldn\'t help but notice how the media forgot about the war in Syria, and visualised his idea in the form of digital collages.Khaled\'s Pokémon series quickly went viral across the globe after he posted it online.This photography series was exhibited in various locations including the American University Museum.\n\nThe app was criticized for using locations such as cemeteries and memorials as sites to catch Pokémon, including the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, Arlington National Cemetery, the ANZAC War Memorial, and Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.Niantic later removed content from sensitive areas such as the Hiroshima Memorial and Holocaust Museum.The game sparked complaints from Dutch company ProRail, who said that players entered their railway tracks, and fire stations told players to not impede their staff by congregating outside.\n\nThe game\'s distribution of PokéStops and gyms (derived from the portals in Ingress, Niantic\'s science fiction-themed AR game) was noted to be sparser in many minority neighborhoods in a reflection of American demographics.Players in rural areas also complained about the lack of Pokémon spawns, PokéStops, and gyms in their area.Pokémon Go was criticized for game accessibility issues by players with physical disabilities.The AbleGamers Foundation COO, Steve Spohn, said that when Pokémon Go was compared to other mobile games, it ""excludes disabled players to a significant degree"".\n\nPolice departments in various countries issued warnings, some tongue-in-cheek, regarding inattentive driving, trespassing, and being targeted by criminals due to being unaware of one\'s surroundings.In the state of New York, sex offenders are banned from playing the app while on parole.Bosnian players were warned to stay out of minefields left over from the 1990s Bosnian War.In Russia, a 21-year-old video blogger, Ruslan Sokolovsky, was arrested in September 2016 for two months after playing Pokémon Go at the Church of All Saints in Yekaterinburg, and eventually received a suspended sentence for three and a half years in prison for charges of blasphemy.\n\nPeople have suffered various injuries from accidents related to the game.In Japan, the first accident occurred within hours of the game\'s release.The first death in Japan attributed to Pokémon Go occurred in late August 2016.A distracted driver playing the game killed one woman and seriously injured another.The 39-year-old farmer did not notice the women crossing a street and struck them with his truck.The woman died of a broken neck.Japan\'s National Police Agency said it was the 79th Pokémon Go-related accident in the country.On August 11, 2016, a young girl in Cambodia was reportedly killed after being hit by a car while trying to capture a Pokémon on a road.The case was the first death related to Pokémon Go among Southeast Asian countries.In January 2017, Chinese-American civilian Jiansheng Chen was shot dead while playing Pokémon Go.\n\nAl-Azhar University in Cairo described the game as ""harmful mania.""A Cossack leader declared that it ""smacks of Satanism"", Kuwait banned the game from government sites, Indonesian officials deemed it a national security threat, and in Israel the IDF banned the game from Army bases out of security considerations.In Saudi Arabia, the General Secretariat of the Council of Senior Scholars declared, in light of a 2001 fatwa banning the Pokémon card game as a form of gambling, that the electronic app required a new ruling.This was also followed by both Indian and Malaysian Islamic leaders telling Indian and Malaysian Muslims to avoid the game.\n\nDuring Thailand\'s 2016 constitutional referendum polling, Pokémon Go players were told to refrain from entering polling stations.Thus the Thai National Broadcasting and Communications Commission intends to ask Niantic to remove Pokémon characters and PokéStops from locations such as government facilities, historic and religious sites, private property as well as dangerous spots such as narrow footpaths and rivers.Cambodia has banned the game in a former genocide site after Pokémon players showed up at the site.Vietnam has banned players from entering the government and defense offices.The Vietnamese Ministry of Information and Communications is also considering the game\'s negative impact to Vietnamese society, where many people left home at night, crossed the road or drove on the street with their eyes kept focused on phones, which brought the need to ban the game in the country.Following the move by other Southeast Asian neighbors, the Philippines also banned the game in all administration offices.According to a survey by Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF), around 4% of employers in Malaysia fired their staff for playing the game during working hours.\n\nRussia also voiced their concerns over the application, with Nikolay Nikiforov, the country\'s Minister of Communications and Mass Media, suspecting foreign intelligence agencies using the application to collect information, while some fundamentalist religious groups in the region claim it to be demonic.The Supreme Council of Virtual Space in Iran officially banned the game in August 2016 over security concerns.The same month, The Pentagon facility in U.S. restricted the use of the game on their property, citing security risks by collecting secret information.In the United Kingdom, 290 police incidents were reported to have occurred in July 2016 in the country due to the game.In September 2016, Niantic stopped supporting the CyanogenMod mobile operating system.This prevented users playing on CyanogenMod from playing the game from that point forward.\n\nIn India, the Gujarat High Court issued a notice to Niantic, the developer of the popular AR-based game, on the grounds of ""posing danger to public safety"".The notice was issued on a PIL (Public Interest Litigation) seeking a ban on the location-based AR reality game in India.In addition, a second PIL was filed against the developers of Pokémon Go for hurting religious sentiments by showing images of eggs in places of worship of different religious groups.But the Indian Government refused to ban the game.\n\nPokémon Gos targeted local advertising has been described by Shoshana Zuboff in The Age of Surveillance Capitalism as an experiment that initiated from Google to move targeted advertising from the digital domain (cost per click) into the physical domain (cost per visit) by the use of sponsored locations.""In the end we recognize that the probe was designed to explore the next frontier: the means of behavioral modification.The game about the game is, in fact, an experimental facsimile of surveillance capitalism\'s design for our future.""\n\nMultiple unofficial, third-party apps were created to correspond with Pokémon Go.Notable apps include ""Poké Radar"" and ""Helper for Pokémon Go"", where players can crowdsource much of the Pokémon that can be found in the game at a particular time.At its peak of popularity, ""Poké Radar"" hit #2 on the Apple App Store, behind Pokémon Go itself.\n\nAnother app, GoChat, which allows players to leave messages for other players at specific locations, accrued more than 1 million downloads in five days and reached the top 10 in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.However, the app\'s developer Jonathan Zarra chose to leave the app unmonetized and had financial trouble keeping the app\'s servers online until bringing on angel investor and board member Michael Robertson.After acquiring significant funding, the app reached over 2 million active users.According to RiskIQ, at least 215 fake versions of the game were available by July 17, 2016.Several of these fake apps contained malicious programming and viruses.\n\nLaunched on July 22, 2016, ""Pokévision"" enabled players to find exactly where Pokémon spawned and how much time was left until they despawned; the site used data hacked directly from the game.In the five days following the website\'s launch, 27 million unique visitors used the site.On July 31, multiple search apps and sites, including Pokévision, were disabled as they violated Niantic\'s terms of service.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Niantic responded by implementing changes and new features in the game which allowed players to easily play remotely.However, starting on August 1, 2021, Niantic began rolling back these changes as part of their Exploration Bonus Updates.Players in New Zealand and the United States were the first to receive the post-pandemic changes, and gradually, they were rolled out to the rest of the world ""in accordance with recommendations from global health organizations.""In fear of violations in health and personal safety regulations, as well as negatively impacting players with disabilities, the company has since received heavy criticism from the player base (including top players Brandon Tan and Nick Oyzon) due to their reverting safety measures implemented during the pandemic, in which gym and Pokéstop interaction distances were increased from 40 to 80 metres.Despite increasing rates of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in various U.S. states (resulting in overflowing hospitals), Niantic are firm on not keeping the pandemic bonuses.Players began boycotting Pokémon Go since in first week of August 2021.\n\nOn Twitter, the #HearUsNiantic started trending worldwide as fans and players voiced their censure towards Niantic\'s decision to remove the pandemic bonuses.A letter was sent to Niantic, which responded to the community by stating that the pandemic changes will not stay.As Niantic are an AR company, part of their business strategy is to sell user data by players after completing AR Mapping tasks where they can log their surroundings at marked PokéStops in their in-game maps.The reduced distance means an increased potential for Niantic to generate more revenue.Another reason for their changes is for Niantic to preserve their image of being an AR tech giant; on their blog post they stated that it is their ""mission"" to ""encourage outdoor exploration"" and ""to connect [people] to real places in the real world, and to visit places that are worth exploring.""Players have also speculated that Niantic is rolling back the pandemic bonuses to send players closer to sponsored businesses such as McDonald\'s (marked by a PokéStop or gym), from which Niantic has made a lot of money.\n\nList of

52,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Pokémon Go', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'Pokémon Go (stylized as Pokémon GO) is a 2016 augmented reality (AR) mobile game, part of the Pokémon franchise, developed and published by Niantic in collaboration with Nintendo and The Pokémon Company for iOS and Android devices.It uses mobile devices with GPS to locate, capture, train, and battle virtual Pokémon, which appear as if they are in the player\'s real-world location.The game is free-to-play; it uses a freemium business model combined with local advertising and supports in-app purchases for additional in-game items.The game launched with around 150 species of Pokémon, which had increased to around 700 by 2021.\n\nPokémon Go was released to mixed reviews; critics praised the concept but criticized technical problems.It was one of the most used and profitable mobile apps in 2016, having been downloaded more than 500 million times worldwide by the end of the year.It is credited with popularizing location-based and AR technology, promoting physical activity, and helping local businesses grow due to escalated foot traffic.However, it attracted controversy for contributing to accidents and creating public nuisances.Various governments expressed concerns about security, and some countries regulate its use.The game had over monthly active users by May 2018, over a billion global downloads by early 2019, and grossed more than in revenue by 2020.\n\nAfter establishing a game account, players create and customize their own avatars.Once created, an avatar is displayed on a map based on the player\'s geographical location.Features on the map include \'PokéStops\' and \'Pokémon Gyms\'.These PokéStops can be equipped with items called \'Lure Modules\', which attract additional wild, and occasionally rare, Pokémon.Gyms serve as battle locations for team-based king of the hill matches.PokéStops and Gyms are typically located at places of interest.These locations were initially re-purposed portals from Ingress, Niantic\'s previous augmented reality (AR) game.This has led to PokéStops and Pokémon Gyms being placed at dangerous or inconvenient locations, such as a now-deleted Gym at the Korean Demilitarized Zone and Bagram Airforce Base, which was abandoned by U.S. forces in July 2021.Since 2019, these locations also include submissions from Go players which are largely reviewed by other players.\n\nAs players move within their real world surroundings, their avatars move within the game\'s map.Different Pokémon species reside in different areas of the world; for example, Water-type Pokémon are generally found near water.When a player encounters a Pokémon, it may be viewed either in AR mode or with a live rendered, generic background.AR mode uses the camera and gyroscope on the player\'s mobile device to display an image of a Pokémon as though it were in the real world.Players can take screenshots of the Pokémon they encounter either with or without the AR mode activated.\n\nAlthough the game is free to play, it supports in-app purchases, where players can purchase additional Poké Balls and other in-game items.These items include Incense, which attracts Pokémon to the player as they move for sixty minutes, Lure Modules, which players use at PokéStops to attract Pokémon to their current location near the PokeStop, and Lucky Eggs, which double experience points gained for a thirty-minute period from use.All Pokémon are displayed with a Combat Power, which is a rough measure of how powerful that Pokémon is in battle.Generally, as players level up, they catch Pokémon with higher CP and Pokémon are somewhat harder to catch.The player can check how strong their Pokémon are by the ""Appraisal"" system.\n\nPlayers can customize their avatar\'s appearance with clothing options that differ in availability according to season, player level, and game sponsors.Clothing includes: hats, accessories, tops, bottoms, socks, footwear and bags.Most clothing aligns with either the look of a specific Pokémon, a specific team and/or Pokémon region.Many pieces of clothing are free, but pieces can also be purchased using coins, earned during select events, awarded as the player levels up, or received as a prize for special research completion.\n\nAnother way for a player to customize their avatar is with a pose.Poses, like clothing, are free, purchased, or awarded.Certain poses are event based and can only be earned during the event they are attached to.Once the event is over, there is no guarantee that the pose will be available in-game again.\n\nIn April 2024, Pokémon GO was updated to allow greater customization of player avatars.Customization now includes a limited number of different hair styles, the ability to adjust the weight of the avatar, and expanded options for skin color.This update was met with mass backlash from the playerbase, as the new avatars were perceived to be of inferior graphical quality in comparison to the outgoing models, and because the updated models interfered with some pre-update cosmetic items, of which many had been purchased by players.\n\nUnlike most other installments in the Pokémon series, players in Pokémon Go do not battle wild Pokémon to catch them.During an encounter with a wild Pokémon, a player may throw a Poké Ball at it by flicking it from the bottom of the screen up toward the Pokémon.If the Pokémon is caught, it will come under the ownership of the player.Factors in the success rate of catching a Pokémon include the Pokémon\'s catch rate, the timing, the type of Poké Ball used, etc.After catching a wild Pokémon, the player is awarded two types of in-game currencies: Candies and Stardust.The Candies awarded by a successful catch depend on what evolutionary chain a Pokémon belongs to.A player can use Stardust and Candies to raise a Pokémon\'s level and hence ""Combat Power"" (CP).However, only Candies are needed to evolve a Pokémon, except for certain Pokémon that might need special items.Each Pokémon evolution tree has its own type of Candy, which can only be used to evolve or level up.The maximum level a player can achieve was originally level 40, but expanded to 50 as of November 30, 2020.The player can also transfer the Pokémon back to the Pokémon Professor Willow to earn more Candies and create room for more Pokémon.Shiny Pokémon are available through multiple ways, mostly by chance.One popular goal of the game is to complete the entries in the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon logbook, by catching and evolving them to collect every one in it.\n\nIn September 2016, Niantic introduced a ""Buddy Pokémon"" feature, which allows players to pick a Pokémon to appear alongside them on the profile screen, and receive in-game rewards and bonuses based on the chosen Pokémon.The feature was released later that month.Certain Pokémon have different distances that they need to be walked in order to receive candy.The more the player walks in real time, the more candy they can earn.During the same update, Niantic made it impossible for players with rooted or jailbroken devices to log into the game in an effort to reduce and prevent cheating.\n\nOn January 20, 2018, Pokémon Go held the first Community Day, a monthly event that increases the appearance rate of a specific Pokémon and offer an exclusive move to the final evolution of the featured Pokémon only if caught or evolved during the event window.Players also have a higher chance to catch the Shiny variant of the featured Pokémon.The first Community Day featured Pikachu, with the exclusive move Surf to Raichu.\n\nThe game is regularly updated with new Pokémon, and as of March 25, 2022, there are just over 730 Pokémon in the game (not including regional varieties) out of a total 1008.\n\nRegional Pokémon are often released together, such as Hoenn region Pokémon released in December 2017, Alolan variants in May 2018, Sinnoh region Pokémon(along with the Sinnoh Stone item used to evolve them) released in October 2018, Unova region Pokémon (and the Unova Stone) in September 2019, Kalos region Pokémon in December 2020, and again more Alola region Pokémon in March 2022.\n\nMythical and legendary Pokémon are often released individually (or in pairs/trios) in special events or quests.The first Legendary Pokémon released was Groudon, in December 2017.The Mythical Pokémon Meltan and its evolved form, Melmetal are so far the only Pokémon to have made their debut on Pokémon Go.Their release coincided with the release of Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee!on the Nintendo Switch, Pokémon Go introduced the new Mythical Pokémon Meltan originally as a teaser, later to be available to capture only in Pokémon Go via a ""Mystery Box"" item that could be obtained through transferring Pokémon from Pokémon Go to either Nintendo Switch Pokémon games, or by completing new Research Tasks.\n\nIn August 2020, Mega Evolution came to Pokémon Go with four Pokémon able to Mega Evolve into five forms.\n\nPlayers earn experience points for various in-game activities.Players rise in level as they earn experience points (XP), with various features being progressively unlocked.Most-notably, at level five, the player can battle at a Pokémon Gym and join one of three color-coded teams (red for Team Valor, blue for Team Mystic, or yellow for Team Instinct), which act as factions battling for control of Gyms within the Pokémon Go world.\n\nIn June 2017, Niantic announced that the game mechanics of Gyms would be revamped for a more teamwork-oriented experience; Gyms were disabled on June 19, 2017, with the new Gyms being released with the next app update a few days later.As of the update, Gyms included a spinnable component to receive in-game items such as Potions and Poké Balls.Additionally, Gyms are capped at containing six Pokémon, each of which must be unique in that Gym.Coins are now earned based on the amount of time the defending Pokémon has been in a Gym, as opposed to a one-per-day gym defender bonus of 10 coins per current defending Pokémon.Legendary, Mythical and Buddy Pokémon cannot be placed in Gyms.\n\nIn July 2017, Raid Battles were introduced.Raid Battles consist of a group of players gathering to confront an over-leveled Pokémon located in a Gym.If the Pokémon is defeated, the players gain the chance to catch a regular version of it.Raid difficulties range from 1 to 5, with 1 being of the lowest difficulty, and 5 being the most difficult to defeat.Level 5 raids are exclusive to Legendary Pokémon.The first of these, Articuno and Lugia, were released on July 22, 2017, after the Go Fest, with Moltres and Zapdos following.From September to November, the 3 Legendary Beasts: Entei, Raikou and Suicune, were released shortly after, rotating regions every month.Following their departure, the Legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh appeared in Raid Battles from November 27, 2017, to December 12, 2017.In August 2020, level 3 Mega raids arrived with the introduction of Mega Evolution.At the same time, Level 2 and 4 raids were combined into Level 1 and 3 raids.\n\nIn May 2022, Raid Battle were updated to include the addition of Mega Legendary Pokémon, which were turned to 6 stars, the highest currently in the game.The only Pokémon included in these Raids were Mega Latios and Mega Latias.\n\nIn October 2022, a new form of raid battle called ""Elite Raids"" were introduced.Elite Raids differ to normal raids in a number of ways, most notably that they can only be battled in person, take 24 hours to start, and are extremely difficult, often requiring a large number of players to defeat the Pokémon.\n\nIn May 2023, another new form of raid battles were introduced called ""Shadow Raids"".Shadow Raids may only be battled in person and award the chance to catch a Shadow Pokémon upon defeat.During the battle, the Pokémon may become ""enraged"", increasing both attack and defence, but can be returned to normal using a ""Purified Gem"".\n\nIn December 2018, Niantic added player vs player Trainer Battles.In January 2020, Niantic rolled out an online battle format Go Battle League which allows players to fight other players worldwide.Unlike the Trainer Battles format introduced in 2018, Go Battle League does not require physical proximity, scanning QR code on each other\'s phone, knowing each other\'s friend code, or any other real-world interactions between players.Instead, participating players are automatically paired by the game server via some variant of the Elo rating system.\n\nIn July 2019, Pokémon Go introduced Team GO Rocket battles.Team GO Rocket NPCs could be battled at PokéStops indicated with it twitching and being a dark color or in Team GO Rocket Balloons which follow the player on the map.After victory, the player has the opportunity to capture a ""Shadow Pokémon"" which are relatively low-leveled, angry-looking Pokémon.Shadow Pokémon have a higher attack stat but a lower defense stat than a normal Pokémon.After capture, the player can choose to purify the Shadow Pokémon.Purified Pokémon are higher-leveled than their Shadow counterparts, can learn an exclusive move when purified, and need fewer candies to evolve.\n\nThe concept for the game was conceived in 2014 by Satoru Iwata of Nintendo and Tsunekazu Ishihara of The Pokémon Company as an April Fools\' Day collaboration with Google, called the Google Maps: Pokémon Challenge.Ishihara was a fan of developer Niantic\'s previous transreality game, Ingress, and saw the game\'s concept as a perfect match for the Pokémon series.Niantic, a subsidiary of Google, used the crowdsourced data from Ingress to populate the locations for PokéStops and gyms within Pokémon Go, data from Google Maps to spawn specific Pokémon on certain terrain, and map display from OpenStreetMap since December 2017.The game\'s application logic uses the open source Kubernetes system - and due to the game\'s sheer scale of users, a number of bugs with the Kubernetes system was discovered and later fixed.Niantic was spun off from Google as an independent company in 2015 following the company reorganization into Alphabet Inc.\n\nIn 2015, Ishihara dedicated his speech at the game\'s announcement on September 10 to Iwata, who had died two months earlier.Tatsuo Nomura, who joined Niantic in 2015 after he developed the Google Maps Pokémon Challenge, acted as Director and Product Manager for the game.The game\'s soundtrack was written by longtime Pokémon series composer, Junichi Masuda, who also assisted with some of the game\'s design.Among the game\'s graphic designers was Dennis Hwang, who previously created the logo of Gmail while working for Google.\n\nOn March 4, 2016, Niantic announced a Japan-exclusive beta test would begin later that month, allowing players to assist in refining the game before its full release.The beta test was later expanded to other countries.On April 7, it was announced that the beta would expand to Australia and New Zealand.Then, on May 16, the signups for the field test were opened to the United States.The test came to an end on June 30.\n\nAt the Comic-Con 2016, John Hanke, founder of Niantic, revealed the appearances of the three team leaders: Candela (Team Valor), Blanche (Team Mystic), and Spark (Team Instinct).Hanke conveyed that approximately 10% of the ideas for the game were implemented.Future updates, including the addition of trading, more Pokémon, implementation of Pokémon Centers at PokéStops, a patch for the ""three step glitch"", and easier training, were also confirmed.He also stated that Niantic would be continuing support for the game for ""years to come"".In an interview with TechCrunch in September 2016, Hanke hinted that player vs. player Pokémon battles would be released in a future update.In December 2016, coffeehouse chain Starbucks and telecommunications company Sprint collaborated with Nintendo to add PokéStops and gyms at certain locations of theirs throughout the United States.That same month, a companion app for Apple Watch devices was released, which allows users to receive notifications about nearby Pokémon, but does not allow for them to be caught.In January 2017, an additional 5,000 more Starbucks locations became available as gyms.In February 2017, an update was released which introduced over 100 species based in the Johto region from the second generation of the core Pokémon series, which were added alongside the original 151.The update also included the addition of new berries, new Pokémon encounter mechanics, and an expanded selection of avatar clothing options.Some of the Pokémon introduced in Ruby and Sapphire were added in late 2017, starting with a Halloween event in October and 50 more in December.A weather system was added alongside the latter, allowing real-world weather to affect gameplay.In November 2018, a game developed by Game Freak and heavily inspired by Pokémon Go, Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee! was released on the Nintendo Switch.This game will feature Pokémon Go style catching with Joy-Con and there has integration between the two games.In addition, new Pokémon Meltan was revealed in September, becoming the first new Pokémon to be released through Pokémon Go.On October 10, 2018, The Pokémon Company and Niantic announced plans to introduce Pokémon from Diamond and Pearl into Pokémon Go.On October 12, Niantic teased one of the Generation IV Pokémon that would be coming to Pokémon Go.On October 25, a feature known as Adventure Sync was announced, which will record the player\'s walking data in the background.On October 26, Niantic announced research tasks for Bug type Pokémon that will give players a chance to catch Shedinja throughout November.\n\nAccording to John Hanke in a January 2019 interview with Business Insider, 2018 saw Go become the game initially envisioned by Niantic.\n\nIn 2020, Niantic made major changes to gameplay mechanisms to account for the COVID-19 pandemic which saw many players unable to leave their homes to play.These development shift saw changes like the addition of indoor step tracking to count toward in-game distance challenges, long distance PVP battles, increased ""incense"" effectiveness, increased spawn points, and a doubled player radius.\n\nThe Pokémon Go Plus is a Bluetooth Low Energy wearable device, developed by Nintendo\'s Platform Technology Development division, that allows players to perform certain actions in the game without looking at their smart device.When a player is near a Pokémon or PokéStop, the Plus vibrates.The player can then press the button to capture the Pokémon or receive items from the PokéStop; the player cannot check what they have received until the next time they sign into the app onto their mobile device.The design consists of a Poké Ball and the shape of the Google Maps pin.The decision to create the device rather than create a smartwatch app was to increase uptake among players for whom a smartwatch is prohibitively expensive.It was released in the United Kingdom and North America on September 16, 2016.\n\nThe game\'s official launch began on July 6, 2016, with releases in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.Due to server strain from high demand upon release, Niantic CEO John Hanke stated that the release in other regions was to be ""paused until Niantic was comfortable"" fixing the issues.European releases started on July 13, and the game became available to most of the continent over the following ten days.The Japanese launch was initially reported to be on July 20; however, the game was delayed after a sponsorship deal with fast food chain McDonald\'s was leaked, instead releasing two days later.Although the game was proposed to be released in France on July 15, it was postponed until July 24 out of respect and due to safety concerns following a terrorist attack in Nice on July 14.Following the shut down of third-party apps and websites in late-July 2016—significantly reducing server strain—Niantic was able to continue pushing release worldwide.Central and South America and most of Southeast Asia subsequently saw releases in early August.Indonesia was the first Asian country to have the game playable, despite the game not being officially released in that region until August 6.\n\nIn South Korea, the game was not officially released as major restrictions on the use of online mapping data exist.However, due to a glitch, a small area around Sokcho in the northeastern part of the country was considered a part of Niantic\'s North Korea mapping region, making the game fully playable in that area.Numerous people took advantage of the gap to play the game.Bus tickets from the capital city of Seoul sold out and people living within Sokcho shared information on free Wi-Fi areas to tourists.Players also discovered a gym in Panmunjom, along the Korean Demilitarized Zone; however, Niantic later removed it from the game.Following the release of Pokémon Go in Japan, parts of Busan also became playable as parts of the city are considered part of Japan\'s mapping area due to the proximity of Tsushima Island.The game officially released in the country in January 2017.\n\nIn mainland China, Google services are banned by the Great Firewall, whereas the GPS function in the game is blocked by Niantic.Players of Pokémon Go in China have to download the game with App Store IDs from other regions and use VPN to access Google services in order to load the game, and some even use a GPS spoofing app to bypass the GPS blocking.Some players also downloaded a clone app called City Spirit Go, which was released shortly after Pokémon Go beta test in Japan.As of 2020, the official game is still unplayable in most parts of China with GPS modules being blocked in-game.\n\nDuring its launch in Southeast Asia in August 2016, the game officially excluded Myanmar, but users in Thailand discovered that the game was fully playable in border cities near the nation.The game was released in the Balkans, Macau, and Central Asia in September 2016, and was also released throughout Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia by the end of the year.\n\nOn September 11, 2018, the game appeared in Russia\'s App Store and Google Play Store over two years after the first launch.However, Niantic did not officially announce the release.\n\nIn May 2019, the game was released on the Samsung Galaxy Store.\n\nInvestors were buoyed by the response to the initial release of Pokémon Go on July 7, with Nintendo\'s share price rising by an initial 10% and by July 14 shares rose to as high as 50%.Despite Nintendo only owning a 32% stake in The Pokémon Company and an undisclosed stake in Niantic, Nintendo\'s market value increased by US$9 billion within five days of release of Pokémon Go.The trend continued for more than a week after the game\'s release and by July 19, the stock value of Nintendo more than doubled as compared to pre-release.Turnover sales reached a record-breaking ¥703.6 billion (US$6.6 billion); and trading of the stock accounted for a quarter of all trades on the Tokyo Stock Exchange\'s main board.The Financial Times believed that investors were speculating not on Pokémon Go as such, but on future Nintendo app releases being as successful as the company moves more into the mobile app market—an area they were historically reluctant to enter in the belief it would cannibalise its portable console and video game sales.Nintendo plans to release four more smartphone app games by March 2017, and investors remarked that Pokémon Go showed Nintendo still has some of the ""most valuable character intellectual property in the world"" with franchises such as Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid.\n\nBy July 22, Nintendo gained ¥1.8 trillion ($17.6 billion) in market capitalization since the game\'s launch.However, following clarification from Nintendo that the company did not produce Pokémon Go nor had tangible financial gains from it, its stock fell by 18%—equating to a ¥708 billion ($6.7 billion) loss in market value—on July 25.This was the largest single-day decline for Nintendo since 1990 and the maximum one-day exchange of finances allowed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.The company has an approximate 13% ""effective economic stake"" in the game, according to Macquarie Securities.\n\nThe surge in stocks extended beyond Nintendo, with Tomy, TV Tokyo, and the Bank of Kyoto, among other companies, all seeing significant gains.Similarly, Zagg, which owns a company that manufactures battery cases, saw a 25% rise in its stock in relation to Pokémon Go.\n\nAt launch, the game suffered from frequent server outages due to extreme usage.The global server usage expectation for the game was surpassed within 15 minutes of the game\'s release in Australia and New Zealand, and peaked at 50 times expected traffic, or 10 times the expected worst-case scenario.Frequent crashes and authentication errors plagued the game\'s release and persisted for several days.For the first two days after launch, players were unable to access the game through their Pokémon Trainer Club accounts; only Gmail-based accounts were able to gain access to the game.Servers again suffered frequent outages in Australia on July 11; players blamed people in the United Kingdom for bypassing local servers and using Australian ones to play the game before its official release.On July 16, a few hours after the release in many European countries, the game\'s servers temporarily went down.The outage was claimed by a hacking group called ""PoodleCorp"", who said they used a DDoS attack to take them down, although the problem was fixed later that day.The next day, the servers went down again as the game was launched in Canada.John Hanke issued an apology for the server issues at San Diego Comic Con 2016, stating ""we weren\'t provisioned for what happened"".\n\nSome early iOS installs of Pokémon Go required users to provide the app with full access to their Google accounts, thereby allowing the app to ""access players\' Gmail-based email, Google Drive-based files, photos and videos stored in Google Photos, and any other content within their Google accounts"".The Pokémon Company and Niantic responded to the concerns, recognizing that the iOS app, at the time, ""... erroneously requests full access permission for the user\'s Google account ...""However, Adam Reeve—the person who initially made claims of the security issues in a Tumblr post—later backtracked on his claim and was not ""100 percent sure"" it was valid.Dan Guido, CEO of the security company Trail of Bits, analyzed the app\'s programming and discovered that although the game did request full account access, this did not enable third-party usage as initially conveyed.Guido found that this did enable Niantic to access people\'s email addresses and phone numbers unintentionally.A subsequent iOS app update reduced the scope of access.Niantic also issued a statement assuring users that no information was collected nor was any information beyond what was necessary to use the app accessed.\n\nAlongside server issues, Pokémon Go suffered from several glitches.One of the more prominent bugs appeared in mid-July 2016 and rendered the game\'s tracking feature useless.Normally, this feature shows between zero and three footprints to inform the player of how close they are to a nearby Pokémon; however, it universally became ""stuck"" at three steps, earning it the name ""three-step-glitch"".Niantic removed the footstep feature altogether on July 30, sparking criticism from players.By August 1, players reported a new glitch that swaps their captured Pokémon with another creature at random.Another bug, confirmed by Niantic in August, inadvertently made capturing Pokémon more difficult.Some legendary Pokémon, which are rare and powerful versions of the creatures, were also obtained by players in a glitch, though they were later removed from the accounts of the trainers to keep the game fair.\n\nPokémon Go released to ""mixed or average"" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.Upon release, critics called the experience enjoyable, but noted the game\'s technical issues.\n\nCritics praised various aspects of Pokémon Go.Oscar Dayus (Pocket Gamer) said that the game was an immensely enjoyable experience and continued with how ""the very personal nature of catching Pokémon in your own neighborhood made me smile more than any game has for years"".Jeremy Parish (US Gamer) compared the game and its social aspects to a massively multiplayer online game.Reviewers also praised the game enabling the promotion of physical exercise.Terri Schwartz (IGN) said it was ""secretly the best exercise app out there"" and that it changed her daily walking routine.Patrick Allen (Lifehacker) wrote an article with tips about how to work out using Pokémon Go.Julia Belluz (Vox) said it could be the ""greatest unintentional health fad ever"" and wrote that one of the results of the game that the developers may not have realized was that ""it seems to be getting people moving"".Users took an extra 194 steps per day once they started using the app, which approximated to 26% more than usual.IGN named it the 100th best video game of all time in 2018.\n\nPhilip Kollar and Allegra Frank (Polygon) both agreed that Pokémon Go was ""an exciting social experience"", but were not sure how long the game and its popularity would last, stating it could either last for coming years or ""end up as a brush fire craze that the whole gaming world is talking about for a few weeks and then is forgotten"".\n\nOther critics expressed more negative opinions of the game, with many citing frequent crashes and other technical issues, along with shallow gameplay.Kallie Plagge (IGN) said that although the game lacked in polish and depth, the overall experience made up for it.Matt Peckham (Time) criticized the game for its frequent crashes.Mike Cosimano (Destructoid) also took issue with the game, saying the original idea showed promise, but was improperly executed.Kat Brewster (The Guardian) wrote that although she thought Pokémon Go was not a good game, it was ""a great experience"".The server problems also received negative press.Miguel Concepcion (GameSpot) said that although he enjoyed the game\'s strong social appeal and visual design, the game\'s ""initial iteration is a buggy mess on all levels"", with one of the reasons being the constant server problems.Another glitch that appeared a few days after launch was the ""three-step glitch"", which made it impossible to ""hunt down a specific Pokémon"".Patricia Hernandez (Kotaku) said, ""the three step glitch adds to what has been a terrible launch for Pokémon Go"".Critics also emphasized on the large gap between the rural and urban players.Rural players seem to be at a major disadvantage when playing the game, while city players have access to more PokéStops and Gyms.\n\nPokémon Go rapidly rose the American iOS App Store\'s ""Top Grossing"" and ""Free"" charts.The game has become the fastest game to top the App Store and Google Play, beating Clash Royale, and it became the most downloaded app on the App Store of any app in their first week.Within two days of release, it was installed on more than 5% of Android devices in the United

McDonald\'s, Sprint, pay Niantic Labs for ""Foot Traffic"" on-demand of the retail shops.\n\nThe game was awarded five Guinness World Records in August 2016: most revenue grossed by a mobile game in its first month (); most downloaded mobile game in its first month (130 million downloads); most international charts topped simultaneously for a mobile game in its first month (top game in 70

Niantic released a Halloween-themed event, which saw a surge in revenue up to 133% as reported by Sensor Tower, placing the game back to top of the charts of highest grossing apps.It was reported that the game earned approximately $23.3 million between October 25 and 29, up from approximately $10 million between October 18 and 22.According to App Annie, Pokémon Go grossed an estimated in

installs and revenue is the United States, followed by Japan and Germany in revenue and by Brazil and Mexico in installs.\n\nDuring 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic causing restrictions on the ability of players to play Go outside their homes, Niantic implemented new features which allowed players to play the game from inside their homes, and this was credited with increasing its playerbase throughout the year despite the restrictions.Despite a brief drop early in the pandemic, the number of monthly active users of the game rose by 45 percent between January and August 2020, and the game\'s revenue in 2020 was the highest in its history, exceeding even its 2016 revenue.The game generated more than of revenue in the first 10 months of 2020 according to Sensor Tower, and it was the

million people engaged in 1.1 billion interactions that mentioned Pokémon Go on Facebook and Instagram in the month of July.Numerous media outlets referred to the surge in popularity as ""Pokémon Go Mania"", or simply ""Pokémania"".The massive popularity of the game resulted in several unusual positive effects.For example, the game placed players where they can help catch criminals and report crimes in progress, although it has also placed some in harm\'s way, and has even aided law enforcement\'s community relations, albeit with caveats.Businesses also benefited from the nearby presence of PokéStops (or them being PokéStops themselves) with the concomitant influx of people, and the intense exploration of communities has brought local history to the forefront.The game was also seen bringing its players to places of worship, as many Pokégyms are located there.Despite some criticism by religious leaders, this was received positively by religious groups, who saw it as reminding adherents to come and pray.Some establishments considered purchasing lures in the game to attract additional players to PokéStops on their property.Within a week of its release, a secondary market emerged for the game, both for the resell of high-level accounts on Craigslist and PlayerUp, and for the sale of expert advice on Thumbtack.Wireless provider T-Mobile US started an offer for free data for a year for Pokémon Go sessions, and Yelp added a filter that only shows businesses which have a PokéStop nearby.National parks across the United States saw an influx of visitors due to the game, with ""hundreds or thousands"" of people visiting the National Mall and Memorial Parks in Washington, D.C. on the weekend following Pokémon Go release in the country.Small museums with PokéStops placed at exhibits also reported increased attendance, such as the McNay Art Museum in San Antonio, Texas, and the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens in Boca Raton, Florida.Charity organizations also sought engagement from players, with animal shelters offering dog walks to people who want to hatch eggs.\n\nEduardo Paes, then-mayor of Rio de Janeiro, stated that he hoped the app would be released in Brazil before the start of the 2016 Summer Olympics in the city (and it was, on August 3), and United States presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton mentioned the app during their 2016 election campaigns.In late July 2016, during a public address, the President of Italy, Sergio Mattarella, compared a political issue about the date of an incoming referendum as preposterous as the hunt for the Pokémon.Shortly after the game\'s release, Bellator mixed martial artist Michael Page celebrated a knockout of his match opponent, Evangelista Santos by putting on a red Ash Ketchum-like hat and rolling a prop Poké Ball in Santos\'s direction.On July 25, Dwayne Johnson released a promo video featuring MatPat and Ali-A with himself as a tough, rare Pokémon.\n\nThe game was credited for popularizing AR, and was praised by genderfluid groups for letting the players choose a ""style"" instead of ""gender"".The game also had a positive impact among individuals with autism.The ""Pokémon Theme"" from the animated series saw a 630% increase in listeners on music streaming platform Spotify during the month of the game\'s release.Meanwhile, streaming services such as Hulu experienced an increased viewership of the Pokémon series and films.Nintendo reported that sales of the 3DS Pokémon games rose as a result of the game\'s popularity.A Twitch channel, Twitch Plays Pokémon Go, was created that mimics the crowd-played Twitch Plays Pokémon channel, allowing viewers to direct a virtual avatar in the game using an iPhone programmed to spoof its location.Niantic later issued permanent bans to those who cheated the game by means such as GPS spoofing and bots.Pokémon-themed pornography increased in popularity after the release of the game.xHamster, an adult video streaming website, reported that within 5 days of the game\'s release, Pokémon related terms were the most searched for videos.Another adult video streaming website, Pornhub, reported that Pokémon related searches spiked 136%.Pokémon Go was spoofed in the Maroon 5 music video, ""Don\'t Wanna Know"".In the 2016 Doctor Who Christmas special, ""The Return of Doctor Mysterio"", the Doctor creates a distraction by ""flood[ing] the downstairs with Pokémon"", causing the people to run off with their cell phones.In the episode ""Looking for Mr. Goodbart"" from the 28th season of The Simpsons, the people of Springfield become addicted to Peekimon Get, a parody of Pokémon Go.\n\nGos release resulted in a resurgence in popularity for the Pokémon franchise as a whole.The Pokémon Sun and Moon games for the Nintendo 3DS, released later in 2016, was the best-selling video game for the 3DS with over 16 million copies sold, and this was partly attributed to the new fans to the series brought in by Go.In an interview, director of Sun and Moon Shigeru Ohmori remarked that the Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon sequels were designed partly to facilitate entry for newcomers to the franchise brought in by Go.The first Pokémon games for the Nintendo Switch, Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee!, took significant inspirations from Go.A line of official Go merchandise was released in November 2019.\n\nIn addition to standard gameplay, the game has held several in-game and live events.The first live event officially held by Niantic was held in Charlotte, North Carolina, in May 2017.In July 2017, a community event was held in Grant Park, Chicago, in honor of the first anniversary of the game\'s release.Despite the fact that almost no information about the event, including ticket prices and attractions, was released by Niantic ahead of the ticket sale, over 20,000 tickets sold out within a half hour.During the event itself, attendees suffered connectivity issues and crashes, due to the heavy amount of localized cellular activity.Afterwards, Niantic announced that they would refund everybody who bought a ticket, as well as give them $100 of in-game currency.Following the event, around two dozen attendees filed suit against Niantic, seeking travel reimbursement.\n\nFollowing the event in Chicago, other events have been held in Chester, Yokohama, and San Jose.In September 2017, a series of events named ""Safari Zone"" was held in Unibail-Rodamco shopping centers in Oberhausen, Paris and Barcelona, with events the following month in Copenhagen, Prague, Stockholm and Amstelveen.\n\nIn January 2018, Niantic announced monthly community event Community Day which aims to get players to meet up in their local areas.During a multi-hour period, players can encounter more frequent wild spawns of a particular Pokémon, an exclusive move for that Pokémon (or its evolution), an increased probability for the shiny form of that Pokémon, and bonuses such as extra stardust or XP.The Community Days in 2018 featured Pikachu (January 20), Dratini (February 24), Bulbasaur (March 25), Mareep (April 15), Charmander (May 19), Larvitar (June 16), Squirtle (July 8), Eevee (August 11–12), Chikorita (September 22), Beldum (October 21), and Cyndaquil (November 10).\n\nPokémon Go in Syria is a photography series published in 2016 by Syrian artist Khaled Akil.Akil places Pokémon characters in destroyed Syrian streets as a reminder for a world lost behind the screen.While Pokémon Go was trending worldwide, Akil couldn\'t help but notice how the media forgot about the war in Syria, and visualised his idea in the form of digital collages.Khaled\'s Pokémon series quickly went viral across the globe after he posted it online.This photography series was exhibited in various locations including the American University Museum.\n\nThe app was criticized for using locations such as cemeteries and memorials as sites to catch Pokémon, including the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, Arlington National Cemetery, the ANZAC War Memorial, and Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.Niantic later removed content from sensitive areas such as the Hiroshima Memorial and Holocaust Museum.The game sparked complaints from Dutch company ProRail, who said that players entered their railway tracks, and fire stations told players to not impede their staff by congregating outside.\n\nThe game\'s distribution of PokéStops and gyms (derived from the portals in Ingress, Niantic\'s science fiction-themed AR game) was noted to be sparser in many minority neighborhoods in a reflection of American demographics.Players in rural areas also complained about the lack of Pokémon spawns, PokéStops, and gyms in their area.Pokémon Go was criticized for game accessibility issues by players with physical disabilities.The AbleGamers Foundation COO, Steve Spohn, said that when Pokémon Go was compared to other mobile games, it ""excludes disabled players to a significant degree"".\n\nPolice departments in various countries issued warnings, some tongue-in-cheek, regarding inattentive driving, trespassing, and being targeted by criminals due to being unaware of one\'s surroundings.In the state of New York, sex offenders are banned from playing the app while on parole.Bosnian players were warned to stay out of minefields left over from the 1990s Bosnian War.In Russia, a 21-year-old video blogger, Ruslan Sokolovsky, was arrested in September 2016 for two months after playing Pokémon Go at the Church of All Saints in Yekaterinburg, and eventually received a suspended sentence for three and a half years in prison for charges of blasphemy.\n\nPeople have suffered various injuries from accidents related to the game.In Japan, the first accident occurred within hours of the game\'s release.The first death in Japan attributed to Pokémon Go occurred in late August 2016.A distracted driver playing the game killed one woman and seriously injured another.The 39-year-old farmer did not notice the women crossing a street and struck them with his truck.The woman died of a broken neck.Japan\'s National Police Agency said it was the 79th Pokémon Go-related accident in the country.On August 11, 2016, a young girl in Cambodia was reportedly killed after being hit by a car while trying to capture a Pokémon on a road.The case was the first death related to Pokémon Go among Southeast Asian countries.In January 2017, Chinese-American civilian Jiansheng Chen was shot dead while playing Pokémon Go.\n\nAl-Azhar University in Cairo described the game as ""harmful mania.""A Cossack leader declared that it ""smacks of Satanism"", Kuwait banned the game from government sites, Indonesian officials deemed it a national security threat, and in Israel the IDF banned the game from Army bases out of security considerations.In Saudi Arabia, the General Secretariat of the Council of Senior Scholars declared, in light of a 2001 fatwa banning the Pokémon card game as a form of gambling, that the electronic app required a new ruling.This was also followed by both Indian and Malaysian Islamic leaders telling Indian and Malaysian Muslims to avoid the game.\n\nDuring Thailand\'s 2016 constitutional referendum polling, Pokémon Go players were told to refrain from entering polling stations.Thus the Thai National Broadcasting and Communications Commission intends to ask Niantic to remove Pokémon characters and PokéStops from locations such as government facilities, historic and religious sites, private property as well as dangerous spots such as narrow footpaths and rivers.Cambodia has banned the game in a former genocide site after Pokémon players showed up at the site.Vietnam has banned players from entering the government and defense offices.The Vietnamese Ministry of Information and Communications is also considering the game\'s negative impact to Vietnamese society, where many people left home at night, crossed the road or drove on the street with their eyes kept focused on phones, which brought the need to ban the game in the country.Following the move by other Southeast Asian neighbors, the Philippines also banned the game in all administration offices.According to a survey by Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF), around 4% of employers in Malaysia fired their staff for playing the game during working hours.\n\nRussia also voiced their concerns over the application, with Nikolay Nikiforov, the country\'s Minister of Communications and Mass Media, suspecting foreign intelligence agencies using the application to collect information, while some fundamentalist religious groups in the region claim it to be demonic.The Supreme Council of Virtual Space in Iran officially banned the game in August 2016 over security concerns.The same month, The Pentagon facility in U.S. restricted the use of the game on their property, citing security risks by collecting secret information.In the United Kingdom, 290 police incidents were reported to have occurred in July 2016 in the country due to the game.In September 2016, Niantic stopped supporting the CyanogenMod mobile operating system.This prevented users playing on CyanogenMod from playing the game from that point forward.\n\nIn India, the Gujarat High Court issued a notice to Niantic, the developer of the popular AR-based game, on the grounds of ""posing danger to public safety"".The notice was issued on a PIL (Public Interest Litigation) seeking a ban on the location-based AR reality game in India.In addition, a second PIL was filed against the developers of Pokémon Go for hurting religious sentiments by showing images of eggs in places of worship of different religious groups.But the Indian Government refused to ban the game.\n\nPokémon Gos targeted local advertising has been described by Shoshana Zuboff in The Age of Surveillance Capitalism as an experiment that initiated from Google to move targeted advertising from the digital domain (cost per click) into the physical domain (cost per visit) by the use of sponsored locations.""In the end we recognize that the probe was designed to explore the next frontier: the means of behavioral modification.The game about the game is, in fact, an experimental facsimile of surveillance capitalism\'s design for our future.""\n\nMultiple unofficial, third-party apps were created to correspond with Pokémon Go.Notable apps include ""Poké Radar"" and ""Helper for Pokémon Go"", where players can crowdsource much of the Pokémon that can be found in the game at a particular time.At its peak of popularity, ""Poké Radar"" hit #2 on the Apple App Store, behind Pokémon Go itself.\n\nAnother app, GoChat, which allows players to leave messages for other players at specific locations, accrued more than 1 million downloads in five days and reached the top 10 in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.However, the app\'s developer Jonathan Zarra chose to leave the app unmonetized and had financial trouble keeping the app\'s servers online until bringing on angel investor and board member Michael Robertson.After acquiring significant funding, the app reached over 2 million active users.According to RiskIQ, at least 215 fake versions of the game were available by July 17, 2016.Several of these fake apps contained malicious programming and viruses.\n\nLaunched on July 22, 2016, ""Pokévision"" enabled players to find exactly where Pokémon spawned and how much time was left until they despawned; the site used data hacked directly from the game.In the five days following the website\'s launch, 27 million unique visitors used the site.On July 31, multiple search apps and sites, including Pokévision, were disabled as they violated Niantic\'s terms of service.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Niantic responded by implementing changes and new features in the game which allowed players to easily play remotely.However, starting on August 1, 2021, Niantic began rolling back these changes as part of their Exploration Bonus Updates.Players in New Zealand and the United States were the first to receive the post-pandemic changes, and gradually, they were rolled out to the rest of the world ""in accordance with recommendations from global health organizations.""In fear of violations in health and personal safety regulations, as well as negatively impacting players with disabilities, the company has since received heavy criticism from the player base (including top players Brandon Tan and Nick Oyzon) due to their reverting safety measures implemented during the pandemic, in which gym and Pokéstop interaction distances were increased from 40 to 80 metres.Despite increasing rates of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in various U.S. states (resulting in overflowing hospitals), Niantic are firm on not keeping the pandemic bonuses.Players began boycotting Pokémon Go since in first week of August 2021.\n\nOn Twitter, the #HearUsNiantic started trending worldwide as fans and players voiced their censure towards Niantic\'s decision to remove the pandemic bonuses.A letter was sent to Niantic, which responded to the community by stating that the pandemic changes will not stay.As Niantic are an AR company, part of their business strategy is to sell user data by players after completing AR Mapping tasks where they can log their surroundings at marked PokéStops in their in-game maps.The reduced distance means an increased potential for Niantic to generate more revenue.Another reason for their changes is for Niantic to preserve their image of being an AR tech giant; on their blog post they stated that it is their ""mission"" to ""encourage outdoor exploration"" and ""to connect [people] to real places in the real world, and to visit places that are worth exploring.""Players have also speculated that Niantic is rolling back the pandemic bonuses to send players closer to sponsored businesses such as McDonald\'s (marked by a PokéStop or gym), from which Niantic has made a lot of money.\n\nList of

53,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Pokémon Go', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'Pokémon Go (stylized as Pokémon GO) is a 2016 augmented reality (AR) mobile game, part of the Pokémon franchise, developed and published by Niantic in collaboration with Nintendo and The Pokémon Company for iOS and Android devices.It uses mobile devices with GPS to locate, capture, train, and battle virtual Pokémon, which appear as if they are in the player\'s real-world location.The game is free-to-play; it uses a freemium business model combined with local advertising and supports in-app purchases for additional in-game items.The game launched with around 150 species of Pokémon, which had increased to around 700 by 2021.\n\nPokémon Go was released to mixed reviews; critics praised the concept but criticized technical problems.It was one of the most used and profitable mobile apps in 2016, having been downloaded more than 500 million times worldwide by the end of the year.It is credited with popularizing location-based and AR technology, promoting physical activity, and helping local businesses grow due to escalated foot traffic.However, it attracted controversy for contributing to accidents and creating public nuisances.Various governments expressed concerns about security, and some countries regulate its use.The game had over monthly active users by May 2018, over a billion global downloads by early 2019, and grossed more than in revenue by 2020.\n\nAfter establishing a game account, players create and customize their own avatars.Once created, an avatar is displayed on a map based on the player\'s geographical location.Features on the map include \'PokéStops\' and \'Pokémon Gyms\'.These PokéStops can be equipped with items called \'Lure Modules\', which attract additional wild, and occasionally rare, Pokémon.Gyms serve as battle locations for team-based king of the hill matches.PokéStops and Gyms are typically located at places of interest.These locations were initially re-purposed portals from Ingress, Niantic\'s previous augmented reality (AR) game.This has led to PokéStops and Pokémon Gyms being placed at dangerous or inconvenient locations, such as a now-deleted Gym at the Korean Demilitarized Zone and Bagram Airforce Base, which was abandoned by U.S. forces in July 2021.Since 2019, these locations also include submissions from Go players which are largely reviewed by other players.\n\nAs players move within their real world surroundings, their avatars move within the game\'s map.Different Pokémon species reside in different areas of the world; for example, Water-type Pokémon are generally found near water.When a player encounters a Pokémon, it may be viewed either in AR mode or with a live rendered, generic background.AR mode uses the camera and gyroscope on the player\'s mobile device to display an image of a Pokémon as though it were in the real world.Players can take screenshots of the Pokémon they encounter either with or without the AR mode activated.\n\nAlthough the game is free to play, it supports in-app purchases, where players can purchase additional Poké Balls and other in-game items.These items include Incense, which attracts Pokémon to the player as they move for sixty minutes, Lure Modules, which players use at PokéStops to attract Pokémon to their current location near the PokeStop, and Lucky Eggs, which double experience points gained for a thirty-minute period from use.All Pokémon are displayed with a Combat Power, which is a rough measure of how powerful that Pokémon is in battle.Generally, as players level up, they catch Pokémon with higher CP and Pokémon are somewhat harder to catch.The player can check how strong their Pokémon are by the ""Appraisal"" system.\n\nPlayers can customize their avatar\'s appearance with clothing options that differ in availability according to season, player level, and game sponsors.Clothing includes: hats, accessories, tops, bottoms, socks, footwear and bags.Most clothing aligns with either the look of a specific Pokémon, a specific team and/or Pokémon region.Many pieces of clothing are free, but pieces can also be purchased using coins, earned during select events, awarded as the player levels up, or received as a prize for special research completion.\n\nAnother way for a player to customize their avatar is with a pose.Poses, like clothing, are free, purchased, or awarded.Certain poses are event based and can only be earned during the event they are attached to.Once the event is over, there is no guarantee that the pose will be available in-game again.\n\nIn April 2024, Pokémon GO was updated to allow greater customization of player avatars.Customization now includes a limited number of different hair styles, the ability to adjust the weight of the avatar, and expanded options for skin color.This update was met with mass backlash from the playerbase, as the new avatars were perceived to be of inferior graphical quality in comparison to the outgoing models, and because the updated models interfered with some pre-update cosmetic items, of which many had been purchased by players.\n\nUnlike most other installments in the Pokémon series, players in Pokémon Go do not battle wild Pokémon to catch them.During an encounter with a wild Pokémon, a player may throw a Poké Ball at it by flicking it from the bottom of the screen up toward the Pokémon.If the Pokémon is caught, it will come under the ownership of the player.Factors in the success rate of catching a Pokémon include the Pokémon\'s catch rate, the timing, the type of Poké Ball used, etc.After catching a wild Pokémon, the player is awarded two types of in-game currencies: Candies and Stardust.The Candies awarded by a successful catch depend on what evolutionary chain a Pokémon belongs to.A player can use Stardust and Candies to raise a Pokémon\'s level and hence ""Combat Power"" (CP).However, only Candies are needed to evolve a Pokémon, except for certain Pokémon that might need special items.Each Pokémon evolution tree has its own type of Candy, which can only be used to evolve or level up.The maximum level a player can achieve was originally level 40, but expanded to 50 as of November 30, 2020.The player can also transfer the Pokémon back to the Pokémon Professor Willow to earn more Candies and create room for more Pokémon.Shiny Pokémon are available through multiple ways, mostly by chance.One popular goal of the game is to complete the entries in the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon logbook, by catching and evolving them to collect every one in it.\n\nIn September 2016, Niantic introduced a ""Buddy Pokémon"" feature, which allows players to pick a Pokémon to appear alongside them on the profile screen, and receive in-game rewards and bonuses based on the chosen Pokémon.The feature was released later that month.Certain Pokémon have different distances that they need to be walked in order to receive candy.The more the player walks in real time, the more candy they can earn.During the same update, Niantic made it impossible for players with rooted or jailbroken devices to log into the game in an effort to reduce and prevent cheating.\n\nOn January 20, 2018, Pokémon Go held the first Community Day, a monthly event that increases the appearance rate of a specific Pokémon and offer an exclusive move to the final evolution of the featured Pokémon only if caught or evolved during the event window.Players also have a higher chance to catch the Shiny variant of the featured Pokémon.The first Community Day featured Pikachu, with the exclusive move Surf to Raichu.\n\nThe game is regularly updated with new Pokémon, and as of March 25, 2022, there are just over 730 Pokémon in the game (not including regional varieties) out of a total 1008.\n\nRegional Pokémon are often released together, such as Hoenn region Pokémon released in December 2017, Alolan variants in May 2018, Sinnoh region Pokémon(along with the Sinnoh Stone item used to evolve them) released in October 2018, Unova region Pokémon (and the Unova Stone) in September 2019, Kalos region Pokémon in December 2020, and again more Alola region Pokémon in March 2022.\n\nMythical and legendary Pokémon are often released individually (or in pairs/trios) in special events or quests.The first Legendary Pokémon released was Groudon, in December 2017.The Mythical Pokémon Meltan and its evolved form, Melmetal are so far the only Pokémon to have made their debut on Pokémon Go.Their release coincided with the release of Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee!on the Nintendo Switch, Pokémon Go introduced the new Mythical Pokémon Meltan originally as a teaser, later to be available to capture only in Pokémon Go via a ""Mystery Box"" item that could be obtained through transferring Pokémon from Pokémon Go to either Nintendo Switch Pokémon games, or by completing new Research Tasks.\n\nIn August 2020, Mega Evolution came to Pokémon Go with four Pokémon able to Mega Evolve into five forms.\n\nPlayers earn experience points for various in-game activities.Players rise in level as they earn experience points (XP), with various features being progressively unlocked.Most-notably, at level five, the player can battle at a Pokémon Gym and join one of three color-coded teams (red for Team Valor, blue for Team Mystic, or yellow for Team Instinct), which act as factions battling for control of Gyms within the Pokémon Go world.\n\nIn June 2017, Niantic announced that the game mechanics of Gyms would be revamped for a more teamwork-oriented experience; Gyms were disabled on June 19, 2017, with the new Gyms being released with the next app update a few days later.As of the update, Gyms included a spinnable component to receive in-game items such as Potions and Poké Balls.Additionally, Gyms are capped at containing six Pokémon, each of which must be unique in that Gym.Coins are now earned based on the amount of time the defending Pokémon has been in a Gym, as opposed to a one-per-day gym defender bonus of 10 coins per current defending Pokémon.Legendary, Mythical and Buddy Pokémon cannot be placed in Gyms.\n\nIn July 2017, Raid Battles were introduced.Raid Battles consist of a group of players gathering to confront an over-leveled Pokémon located in a Gym.If the Pokémon is defeated, the players gain the chance to catch a regular version of it.Raid difficulties range from 1 to 5, with 1 being of the lowest difficulty, and 5 being the most difficult to defeat.Level 5 raids are exclusive to Legendary Pokémon.The first of these, Articuno and Lugia, were released on July 22, 2017, after the Go Fest, with Moltres and Zapdos following.From September to November, the 3 Legendary Beasts: Entei, Raikou and Suicune, were released shortly after, rotating regions every month.Following their departure, the Legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh appeared in Raid Battles from November 27, 2017, to December 12, 2017.In August 2020, level 3 Mega raids arrived with the introduction of Mega Evolution.At the same time, Level 2 and 4 raids were combined into Level 1 and 3 raids.\n\nIn May 2022, Raid Battle were updated to include the addition of Mega Legendary Pokémon, which were turned to 6 stars, the highest currently in the game.The only Pokémon included in these Raids were Mega Latios and Mega Latias.\n\nIn October 2022, a new form of raid battle called ""Elite Raids"" were introduced.Elite Raids differ to normal raids in a number of ways, most notably that they can only be battled in person, take 24 hours to start, and are extremely difficult, often requiring a large number of players to defeat the Pokémon.\n\nIn May 2023, another new form of raid battles were introduced called ""Shadow Raids"".Shadow Raids may only be battled in person and award the chance to catch a Shadow Pokémon upon defeat.During the battle, the Pokémon may become ""enraged"", increasing both attack and defence, but can be returned to normal using a ""Purified Gem"".\n\nIn December 2018, Niantic added player vs player Trainer Battles.In January 2020, Niantic rolled out an online battle format Go Battle League which allows players to fight other players worldwide.Unlike the Trainer Battles format introduced in 2018, Go Battle League does not require physical proximity, scanning QR code on each other\'s phone, knowing each other\'s friend code, or any other real-world interactions between players.Instead, participating players are automatically paired by the game server via some variant of the Elo rating system.\n\nIn July 2019, Pokémon Go introduced Team GO Rocket battles.Team GO Rocket NPCs could be battled at PokéStops indicated with it twitching and being a dark color or in Team GO Rocket Balloons which follow the player on the map.After victory, the player has the opportunity to capture a ""Shadow Pokémon"" which are relatively low-leveled, angry-looking Pokémon.Shadow Pokémon have a higher attack stat but a lower defense stat than a normal Pokémon.After capture, the player can choose to purify the Shadow Pokémon.Purified Pokémon are higher-leveled than their Shadow counterparts, can learn an exclusive move when purified, and need fewer candies to evolve.\n\nThe concept for the game was conceived in 2014 by Satoru Iwata of Nintendo and Tsunekazu Ishihara of The Pokémon Company as an April Fools\' Day collaboration with Google, called the Google Maps: Pokémon Challenge.Ishihara was a fan of developer Niantic\'s previous transreality game, Ingress, and saw the game\'s concept as a perfect match for the Pokémon series.Niantic, a subsidiary of Google, used the crowdsourced data from Ingress to populate the locations for PokéStops and gyms within Pokémon Go, data from Google Maps to spawn specific Pokémon on certain terrain, and map display from OpenStreetMap since December 2017.The game\'s application logic uses the open source Kubernetes system - and due to the game\'s sheer scale of users, a number of bugs with the Kubernetes system was discovered and later fixed.Niantic was spun off from Google as an independent company in 2015 following the company reorganization into Alphabet Inc.\n\nIn 2015, Ishihara dedicated his speech at the game\'s announcement on September 10 to Iwata, who had died two months earlier.Tatsuo Nomura, who joined Niantic in 2015 after he developed the Google Maps Pokémon Challenge, acted as Director and Product Manager for the game.The game\'s soundtrack was written by longtime Pokémon series composer, Junichi Masuda, who also assisted with some of the game\'s design.Among the game\'s graphic designers was Dennis Hwang, who previously created the logo of Gmail while working for Google.\n\nOn March 4, 2016, Niantic announced a Japan-exclusive beta test would begin later that month, allowing players to assist in refining the game before its full release.The beta test was later expanded to other countries.On April 7, it was announced that the beta would expand to Australia and New Zealand.Then, on May 16, the signups for the field test were opened to the United States.The test came to an end on June 30.\n\nAt the Comic-Con 2016, John Hanke, founder of Niantic, revealed the appearances of the three team leaders: Candela (Team Valor), Blanche (Team Mystic), and Spark (Team Instinct).Hanke conveyed that approximately 10% of the ideas for the game were implemented.Future updates, including the addition of trading, more Pokémon, implementation of Pokémon Centers at PokéStops, a patch for the ""three step glitch"", and easier training, were also confirmed.He also stated that Niantic would be continuing support for the game for ""years to come"".In an interview with TechCrunch in September 2016, Hanke hinted that player vs. player Pokémon battles would be released in a future update.In December 2016, coffeehouse chain Starbucks and telecommunications company Sprint collaborated with Nintendo to add PokéStops and gyms at certain locations of theirs throughout the United States.That same month, a companion app for Apple Watch devices was released, which allows users to receive notifications about nearby Pokémon, but does not allow for them to be caught.In January 2017, an additional 5,000 more Starbucks locations became available as gyms.In February 2017, an update was released which introduced over 100 species based in the Johto region from the second generation of the core Pokémon series, which were added alongside the original 151.The update also included the addition of new berries, new Pokémon encounter mechanics, and an expanded selection of avatar clothing options.Some of the Pokémon introduced in Ruby and Sapphire were added in late 2017, starting with a Halloween event in October and 50 more in December.A weather system was added alongside the latter, allowing real-world weather to affect gameplay.In November 2018, a game developed by Game Freak and heavily inspired by Pokémon Go, Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee! was released on the Nintendo Switch.This game will feature Pokémon Go style catching with Joy-Con and there has integration between the two games.In addition, new Pokémon Meltan was revealed in September, becoming the first new Pokémon to be released through Pokémon Go.On October 10, 2018, The Pokémon Company and Niantic announced plans to introduce Pokémon from Diamond and Pearl into Pokémon Go.On October 12, Niantic teased one of the Generation IV Pokémon that would be coming to Pokémon Go.On October 25, a feature known as Adventure Sync was announced, which will record the player\'s walking data in the background.On October 26, Niantic announced research tasks for Bug type Pokémon that will give players a chance to catch Shedinja throughout November.\n\nAccording to John Hanke in a January 2019 interview with Business Insider, 2018 saw Go become the game initially envisioned by Niantic.\n\nIn 2020, Niantic made major changes to gameplay mechanisms to account for the COVID-19 pandemic which saw many players unable to leave their homes to play.These development shift saw changes like the addition of indoor step tracking to count toward in-game distance challenges, long distance PVP battles, increased ""incense"" effectiveness, increased spawn points, and a doubled player radius.\n\nThe Pokémon Go Plus is a Bluetooth Low Energy wearable device, developed by Nintendo\'s Platform Technology Development division, that allows players to perform certain actions in the game without looking at their smart device.When a player is near a Pokémon or PokéStop, the Plus vibrates.The player can then press the button to capture the Pokémon or receive items from the PokéStop; the player cannot check what they have received until the next time they sign into the app onto their mobile device.The design consists of a Poké Ball and the shape of the Google Maps pin.The decision to create the device rather than create a smartwatch app was to increase uptake among players for whom a smartwatch is prohibitively expensive.It was released in the United Kingdom and North America on September 16, 2016.\n\nThe game\'s official launch began on July 6, 2016, with releases in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.Due to server strain from high demand upon release, Niantic CEO John Hanke stated that the release in other regions was to be ""paused until Niantic was comfortable"" fixing the issues.European releases started on July 13, and the game became available to most of the continent over the following ten days.The Japanese launch was initially reported to be on July 20; however, the game was delayed after a sponsorship deal with fast food chain McDonald\'s was leaked, instead releasing two days later.Although the game was proposed to be released in France on July 15, it was postponed until July 24 out of respect and due to safety concerns following a terrorist attack in Nice on July 14.Following the shut down of third-party apps and websites in late-July 2016—significantly reducing server strain—Niantic was able to continue pushing release worldwide.Central and South America and most of Southeast Asia subsequently saw releases in early August.Indonesia was the first Asian country to have the game playable, despite the game not being officially released in that region until August 6.\n\nIn South Korea, the game was not officially released as major restrictions on the use of online mapping data exist.However, due to a glitch, a small area around Sokcho in the northeastern part of the country was considered a part of Niantic\'s North Korea mapping region, making the game fully playable in that area.Numerous people took advantage of the gap to play the game.Bus tickets from the capital city of Seoul sold out and people living within Sokcho shared information on free Wi-Fi areas to tourists.Players also discovered a gym in Panmunjom, along the Korean Demilitarized Zone; however, Niantic later removed it from the game.Following the release of Pokémon Go in Japan, parts of Busan also became playable as parts of the city are considered part of Japan\'s mapping area due to the proximity of Tsushima Island.The game officially released in the country in January 2017.\n\nIn mainland China, Google services are banned by the Great Firewall, whereas the GPS function in the game is blocked by Niantic.Players of Pokémon Go in China have to download the game with App Store IDs from other regions and use VPN to access Google services in order to load the game, and some even use a GPS spoofing app to bypass the GPS blocking.Some players also downloaded a clone app called City Spirit Go, which was released shortly after Pokémon Go beta test in Japan.As of 2020, the official game is still unplayable in most parts of China with GPS modules being blocked in-game.\n\nDuring its launch in Southeast Asia in August 2016, the game officially excluded Myanmar, but users in Thailand discovered that the game was fully playable in border cities near the nation.The game was released in the Balkans, Macau, and Central Asia in September 2016, and was also released throughout Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia by the end of the year.\n\nOn September 11, 2018, the game appeared in Russia\'s App Store and Google Play Store over two years after the first launch.However, Niantic did not officially announce the release.\n\nIn May 2019, the game was released on the Samsung Galaxy Store.\n\nInvestors were buoyed by the response to the initial release of Pokémon Go on July 7, with Nintendo\'s share price rising by an initial 10% and by July 14 shares rose to as high as 50%.Despite Nintendo only owning a 32% stake in The Pokémon Company and an undisclosed stake in Niantic, Nintendo\'s market value increased by US$9 billion within five days of release of Pokémon Go.The trend continued for more than a week after the game\'s release and by July 19, the stock value of Nintendo more than doubled as compared to pre-release.Turnover sales reached a record-breaking ¥703.6 billion (US$6.6 billion); and trading of the stock accounted for a quarter of all trades on the Tokyo Stock Exchange\'s main board.The Financial Times believed that investors were speculating not on Pokémon Go as such, but on future Nintendo app releases being as successful as the company moves more into the mobile app market—an area they were historically reluctant to enter in the belief it would cannibalise its portable console and video game sales.Nintendo plans to release four more smartphone app games by March 2017, and investors remarked that Pokémon Go showed Nintendo still has some of the ""most valuable character intellectual property in the world"" with franchises such as Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid.\n\nBy July 22, Nintendo gained ¥1.8 trillion ($17.6 billion) in market capitalization since the game\'s launch.However, following clarification from Nintendo that the company did not produce Pokémon Go nor had tangible financial gains from it, its stock fell by 18%—equating to a ¥708 billion ($6.7 billion) loss in market value—on July 25.This was the largest single-day decline for Nintendo since 1990 and the maximum one-day exchange of finances allowed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.The company has an approximate 13% ""effective economic stake"" in the game, according to Macquarie Securities.\n\nThe surge in stocks extended beyond Nintendo, with Tomy, TV Tokyo, and the Bank of Kyoto, among other companies, all seeing significant gains.Similarly, Zagg, which owns a company that manufactures battery cases, saw a 25% rise in its stock in relation to Pokémon Go.\n\nAt launch, the game suffered from frequent server outages due to extreme usage.The global server usage expectation for the game was surpassed within 15 minutes of the game\'s release in Australia and New Zealand, and peaked at 50 times expected traffic, or 10 times the expected worst-case scenario.Frequent crashes and authentication errors plagued the game\'s release and persisted for several days.For the first two days after launch, players were unable to access the game through their Pokémon Trainer Club accounts; only Gmail-based accounts were able to gain access to the game.Servers again suffered frequent outages in Australia on July 11; players blamed people in the United Kingdom for bypassing local servers and using Australian ones to play the game before its official release.On July 16, a few hours after the release in many European countries, the game\'s servers temporarily went down.The outage was claimed by a hacking group called ""PoodleCorp"", who said they used a DDoS attack to take them down, although the problem was fixed later that day.The next day, the servers went down again as the game was launched in Canada.John Hanke issued an apology for the server issues at San Diego Comic Con 2016, stating ""we weren\'t provisioned for what happened"".\n\nSome early iOS installs of Pokémon Go required users to provide the app with full access to their Google accounts, thereby allowing the app to ""access players\' Gmail-based email, Google Drive-based files, photos and videos stored in Google Photos, and any other content within their Google accounts"".The Pokémon Company and Niantic responded to the concerns, recognizing that the iOS app, at the time, ""... erroneously requests full access permission for the user\'s Google account ...""However, Adam Reeve—the person who initially made claims of the security issues in a Tumblr post—later backtracked on his claim and was not ""100 percent sure"" it was valid.Dan Guido, CEO of the security company Trail of Bits, analyzed the app\'s programming and discovered that although the game did request full account access, this did not enable third-party usage as initially conveyed.Guido found that this did enable Niantic to access people\'s email addresses and phone numbers unintentionally.A subsequent iOS app update reduced the scope of access.Niantic also issued a statement assuring users that no information was collected nor was any information beyond what was necessary to use the app accessed.\n\nAlongside server issues, Pokémon Go suffered from several glitches.One of the more prominent bugs appeared in mid-July 2016 and rendered the game\'s tracking feature useless.Normally, this feature shows between zero and three footprints to inform the player of how close they are to a nearby Pokémon; however, it universally became ""stuck"" at three steps, earning it the name ""three-step-glitch"".Niantic removed the footstep feature altogether on July 30, sparking criticism from players.By August 1, players reported a new glitch that swaps their captured Pokémon with another creature at random.Another bug, confirmed by Niantic in August, inadvertently made capturing Pokémon more difficult.Some legendary Pokémon, which are rare and powerful versions of the creatures, were also obtained by players in a glitch, though they were later removed from the accounts of the trainers to keep the game fair.\n\nPokémon Go released to ""mixed or average"" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.Upon release, critics called the experience enjoyable, but noted the game\'s technical issues.\n\nCritics praised various aspects of Pokémon Go.Oscar Dayus (Pocket Gamer) said that the game was an immensely enjoyable experience and continued with how ""the very personal nature of catching Pokémon in your own neighborhood made me smile more than any game has for years"".Jeremy Parish (US Gamer) compared the game and its social aspects to a massively multiplayer online game.Reviewers also praised the game enabling the promotion of physical exercise.Terri Schwartz (IGN) said it was ""secretly the best exercise app out there"" and that it changed her daily walking routine.Patrick Allen (Lifehacker) wrote an article with tips about how to work out using Pokémon Go.Julia Belluz (Vox) said it could be the ""greatest unintentional health fad ever"" and wrote that one of the results of the game that the developers may not have realized was that ""it seems to be getting people moving"".Users took an extra 194 steps per day once they started using the app, which approximated to 26% more than usual.IGN named it the 100th best video game of all time in 2018.\n\nPhilip Kollar and Allegra Frank (Polygon) both agreed that Pokémon Go was ""an exciting social experience"", but were not sure how long the game and its popularity would last, stating it could either last for coming years or ""end up as a brush fire craze that the whole gaming world is talking about for a few weeks and then is forgotten"".\n\nOther critics expressed more negative opinions of the game, with many citing frequent crashes and other technical issues, along with shallow gameplay.Kallie Plagge (IGN) said that although the game lacked in polish and depth, the overall experience made up for it.Matt Peckham (Time) criticized the game for its frequent crashes.Mike Cosimano (Destructoid) also took issue with the game, saying the original idea showed promise, but was improperly executed.Kat Brewster (The Guardian) wrote that although she thought Pokémon Go was not a good game, it was ""a great experience"".The server problems also received negative press.Miguel Concepcion (GameSpot) said that although he enjoyed the game\'s strong social appeal and visual design, the game\'s ""initial iteration is a buggy mess on all levels"", with one of the reasons being the constant server problems.Another glitch that appeared a few days after launch was the ""three-step glitch"", which made it impossible to ""hunt down a specific Pokémon"".Patricia Hernandez (Kotaku) said, ""the three step glitch adds to what has been a terrible launch for Pokémon Go"".Critics also emphasized on the large gap between the rural and urban players.Rural players seem to be at a major disadvantage when playing the game, while city players have access to more PokéStops and Gyms.\n\nPokémon Go rapidly rose the American iOS App Store\'s ""Top Grossing"" and ""Free"" charts.The game has become the fastest game to top the App Store and Google Play, beating

Go as the 9th highest grossing mobile game of 2017, with an annual revenue of .Bloomberg estimated that Pokémon Go generated up to in total revenue by late 2017.Two years from its initial launch, analyst firm Sensor Tower estimated the game had grossed over from in-app purchases, reporting that players around the world continue to spend each day.SuperData Research reported that, in May 2018,

installs and revenue is the United States, followed by Japan and Germany in revenue and by Brazil and Mexico in installs.\n\nDuring 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic causing restrictions on the ability of players to play Go outside their homes, Niantic implemented new features which allowed players to play the game from inside their homes, and this was credited with increasing its playerbase throughout the year despite the restrictions.Despite a brief drop early in the pandemic, the number of monthly active users of the game rose by 45 percent between January and August 2020, and the game\'s revenue in 2020 was the highest in its history, exceeding even its 2016 revenue.The game generated more than of revenue in the first 10 months of 2020 according to Sensor Tower, and it was the

revenue to by 2020.The game generated a further in the first half of 2021.\n\nThe game was referred to as a ""social media phenomenon"" which has brought people together from all walks of life.231 million people engaged in 1.1 billion interactions that mentioned Pokémon Go on Facebook and Instagram in the month of July.Numerous media outlets referred to the surge in popularity as ""Pokémon Go Mania"", or simply ""Pokémania"".The massive popularity of the game resulted in several unusual positive effects.For example, the game placed players where they can help catch criminals and report crimes in progress, although it has also placed some in harm\'s way, and has even aided law enforcement\'s community relations, albeit with caveats.Businesses also benefited from the nearby presence of PokéStops (or them being PokéStops themselves) with the concomitant influx of people, and the intense exploration of communities has brought local history to the forefront.The game was also seen bringing its players to places of worship, as many Pokégyms are located there.Despite some criticism by religious leaders, this was received positively by religious groups, who saw it as reminding adherents to come and pray.Some establishments considered purchasing lures in the game to attract additional players to PokéStops on their property.Within a week of its release, a secondary market emerged for the game, both for the resell of high-level accounts on Craigslist and PlayerUp, and for the sale of expert advice on Thumbtack.Wireless provider T-Mobile US started an offer for free data for a year for Pokémon Go sessions, and Yelp added a filter that only shows businesses which have a PokéStop nearby.National parks across the United States saw an influx of visitors due to the game, with ""hundreds or thousands"" of people visiting the National Mall and Memorial Parks in Washington, D.C. on the weekend following Pokémon Go release in the country.Small museums with PokéStops placed at exhibits also reported increased attendance, such as the McNay Art Museum in San Antonio, Texas, and the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens in Boca Raton, Florida.Charity organizations also sought engagement from players, with animal shelters offering dog walks to people who want to hatch eggs.\n\nEduardo Paes, then-mayor of Rio de Janeiro, stated that he hoped the app would be released in Brazil before the start of the 2016 Summer Olympics in the city (and it was, on August 3), and United States presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton mentioned the app during their 2016 election campaigns.In late July 2016, during a public address, the President of Italy, Sergio Mattarella, compared a political issue about the date of an incoming referendum as preposterous as the hunt for the Pokémon.Shortly after the game\'s release, Bellator mixed martial artist Michael Page celebrated a knockout of his match opponent, Evangelista Santos by putting on a red Ash Ketchum-like hat and rolling a prop Poké Ball in Santos\'s direction.On July 25, Dwayne Johnson released a promo video featuring MatPat and Ali-A with himself as a tough, rare Pokémon.\n\nThe game was credited for popularizing AR, and was praised by genderfluid groups for letting the players choose a ""style"" instead of ""gender"".The game also had a positive impact among individuals with autism.The ""Pokémon Theme"" from the animated series saw a 630% increase in listeners on music streaming platform Spotify during the month of the game\'s release.Meanwhile, streaming services such as Hulu experienced an increased viewership of the Pokémon series and films.Nintendo reported that sales of the 3DS Pokémon games rose as a result of the game\'s popularity.A Twitch channel, Twitch Plays Pokémon Go, was created that mimics the crowd-played Twitch Plays Pokémon channel, allowing viewers to direct a virtual avatar in the game using an iPhone programmed to spoof its location.Niantic later issued permanent bans to those who cheated the game by means such as GPS spoofing and bots.Pokémon-themed pornography increased in popularity after the release of the game.xHamster, an adult video streaming website, reported that within 5 days of the game\'s release, Pokémon related terms were the most searched for videos.Another adult video streaming website, Pornhub, reported that Pokémon related searches spiked 136%.Pokémon Go was spoofed in the Maroon 5 music video, ""Don\'t Wanna Know"".In the 2016 Doctor Who Christmas special, ""The Return of Doctor Mysterio"", the Doctor creates a distraction by ""flood[ing] the downstairs with Pokémon"", causing the people to run off with their cell phones.In the episode ""Looking for Mr. Goodbart"" from the 28th season of The Simpsons, the people of Springfield become addicted to Peekimon Get, a parody of Pokémon Go.\n\nGos release resulted in a resurgence in popularity for the Pokémon franchise as a whole.The Pokémon Sun and Moon games for the Nintendo 3DS, released later in 2016, was the best-selling video game for the 3DS with over 16 million copies sold, and this was partly attributed to the new fans to the series brought in by Go.In an interview, director of Sun and Moon Shigeru Ohmori remarked that the Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon sequels were designed partly to facilitate entry for newcomers to the franchise brought in by Go.The first Pokémon games for the Nintendo Switch, Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee!, took significant inspirations from Go.A line of official Go merchandise was released in November 2019.\n\nIn addition to standard gameplay, the game has held several in-game and live events.The first live event officially held by Niantic was held in Charlotte, North Carolina, in May 2017.In July 2017, a community event was held in Grant Park, Chicago, in honor of the first anniversary of the game\'s release.Despite the fact that almost no information about the event, including ticket prices and attractions, was released by Niantic ahead of the ticket sale, over 20,000 tickets sold out within a half hour.During the event itself, attendees suffered connectivity issues and crashes, due to the heavy amount of localized cellular activity.Afterwards, Niantic announced that they would refund everybody who bought a ticket, as well as give them $100 of in-game currency.Following the event, around two dozen attendees filed suit against Niantic, seeking travel reimbursement.\n\nFollowing the event in Chicago, other events have been held in Chester, Yokohama, and San Jose.In September 2017, a series of events named ""Safari Zone"" was held in Unibail-Rodamco shopping centers in Oberhausen, Paris and Barcelona, with events the following month in Copenhagen, Prague, Stockholm and Amstelveen.\n\nIn January 2018, Niantic announced monthly community event Community Day which aims to get players to meet up in their local areas.During a multi-hour period, players can encounter more frequent wild spawns of a particular Pokémon, an exclusive move for that Pokémon (or its evolution), an increased probability for the shiny form of that Pokémon, and bonuses such as extra stardust or XP.The Community Days in 2018 featured Pikachu (January 20), Dratini (February 24), Bulbasaur (March 25), Mareep (April 15), Charmander (May 19), Larvitar (June 16), Squirtle (July 8), Eevee (August 11–12), Chikorita (September 22), Beldum (October 21), and Cyndaquil (November 10).\n\nPokémon Go in Syria is a photography series published in 2016 by Syrian artist Khaled Akil.Akil places Pokémon characters in destroyed Syrian streets as a reminder for a world lost behind the screen.While Pokémon Go was trending worldwide, Akil couldn\'t help but notice how the media forgot about the war in Syria, and visualised his idea in the form of digital collages.Khaled\'s Pokémon series quickly went viral across the globe after he posted it online.This photography series was exhibited in various locations including the American University Museum.\n\nThe app was criticized for using locations such as cemeteries and memorials as sites to catch Pokémon, including the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, Arlington National Cemetery, the ANZAC War Memorial, and Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.Niantic later removed content from sensitive areas such as the Hiroshima Memorial and Holocaust Museum.The game sparked complaints from Dutch company ProRail, who said that players entered their railway tracks, and fire stations told players to not impede their staff by congregating outside.\n\nThe game\'s distribution of PokéStops and gyms (derived from the portals in Ingress, Niantic\'s science fiction-themed AR game) was noted to be sparser in many minority neighborhoods in a reflection of American demographics.Players in rural areas also complained about the lack of Pokémon spawns, PokéStops, and gyms in their area.Pokémon Go was criticized for game accessibility issues by players with physical disabilities.The AbleGamers Foundation COO, Steve Spohn, said that when Pokémon Go was compared to other mobile games, it ""excludes disabled players to a significant degree"".\n\nPolice departments in various countries issued warnings, some tongue-in-cheek, regarding inattentive driving, trespassing, and being targeted by criminals due to being unaware of one\'s surroundings.In the state of New York, sex offenders are banned from playing the app while on parole.Bosnian players were warned to stay out of minefields left over from the 1990s Bosnian War.In Russia, a 21-year-old video blogger, Ruslan Sokolovsky, was arrested in September 2016 for two months after playing Pokémon Go at the Church of All Saints in Yekaterinburg, and eventually received a suspended sentence for three and a half years in prison for charges of blasphemy.\n\nPeople have suffered various injuries from accidents related to the game.In Japan, the first accident occurred within hours of the game\'s release.The first death in Japan attributed to Pokémon Go occurred in late August 2016.A distracted driver playing the game killed one woman and seriously injured another.The 39-year-old farmer did not notice the women crossing a street and struck them with his truck.The woman died of a broken neck.Japan\'s National Police Agency said it was the 79th Pokémon Go-related accident in the country.On August 11, 2016, a young girl in Cambodia was reportedly killed after being hit by a car while trying to capture a Pokémon on a road.The case was the first death related to Pokémon Go among Southeast Asian countries.In January 2017, Chinese-American civilian Jiansheng Chen was shot dead while playing Pokémon Go.\n\nAl-Azhar University in Cairo described the game as ""harmful mania.""A Cossack leader declared that it ""smacks of Satanism"", Kuwait banned the game from government sites, Indonesian officials deemed it a national security threat, and in Israel the IDF banned the game from Army bases out of security considerations.In Saudi Arabia, the General Secretariat of the Council of Senior Scholars declared, in light of a 2001 fatwa banning the Pokémon card game as a form of gambling, that the electronic app required a new ruling.This was also followed by both Indian and Malaysian Islamic leaders telling Indian and Malaysian Muslims to avoid the game.\n\nDuring Thailand\'s 2016 constitutional referendum polling, Pokémon Go players were told to refrain from entering polling stations.Thus the Thai National Broadcasting and Communications Commission intends to ask Niantic to remove Pokémon characters and PokéStops from locations such as government facilities, historic and religious sites, private property as well as dangerous spots such as narrow footpaths and rivers.Cambodia has banned the game in a former genocide site after Pokémon players showed up at the site.Vietnam has banned players from entering the government and defense offices.The Vietnamese Ministry of Information and Communications is also considering the game\'s negative impact to Vietnamese society, where many people left home at night, crossed the road or drove on the street with their eyes kept focused on phones, which brought the need to ban the game in the country.Following the move by other Southeast Asian neighbors, the Philippines also banned the game in all administration offices.According to a survey by Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF), around 4% of employers in Malaysia fired their staff for playing the game during working hours.\n\nRussia also voiced their concerns over the application, with Nikolay Nikiforov, the country\'s Minister of Communications and Mass Media, suspecting foreign intelligence agencies using the application to collect information, while some fundamentalist religious groups in the region claim it to be demonic.The Supreme Council of Virtual Space in Iran officially banned the game in August 2016 over security concerns.The same month, The Pentagon facility in U.S. restricted the use of the game on their property, citing security risks by collecting secret information.In the United Kingdom, 290 police incidents were reported to have occurred in July 2016 in the country due to the game.In September 2016, Niantic stopped supporting the CyanogenMod mobile operating system.This prevented users playing on CyanogenMod from playing the game from that point forward.\n\nIn India, the Gujarat High Court issued a notice to Niantic, the developer of the popular AR-based game, on the grounds of ""posing danger to public safety"".The notice was issued on a PIL (Public Interest Litigation) seeking a ban on the location-based AR reality game in India.In addition, a second PIL was filed against the developers of Pokémon Go for hurting religious sentiments by showing images of eggs in places of worship of different religious groups.But the Indian Government refused to ban the game.\n\nPokémon Gos targeted local advertising has been described by Shoshana Zuboff in The Age of Surveillance Capitalism as an experiment that initiated from Google to move targeted advertising from the digital domain (cost per click) into the physical domain (cost per visit) by the use of sponsored locations.""In the end we recognize that the probe was designed to explore the next frontier: the means of behavioral modification.The game about the game is, in fact, an experimental facsimile of surveillance capitalism\'s design for our future.""\n\nMultiple unofficial, third-party apps were created to correspond with Pokémon Go.Notable apps include ""Poké Radar"" and ""Helper for Pokémon Go"", where players can crowdsource much of the Pokémon that can be found in the game at a particular time.At its peak of popularity, ""Poké Radar"" hit #2 on the Apple App Store, behind Pokémon Go itself.\n\nAnother app, GoChat, which allows players to leave messages for other players at specific locations, accrued more than 1 million downloads in five days and reached the top 10 in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.However, the app\'s developer Jonathan Zarra chose to leave the app unmonetized and had financial trouble keeping the app\'s servers online until bringing on angel investor and board member Michael Robertson.After acquiring significant funding, the app reached over 2 million active users.According to RiskIQ, at least 215 fake versions of the game were available by July 17, 2016.Several of these fake apps contained malicious programming and viruses.\n\nLaunched on July 22, 2016, ""Pokévision"" enabled players to find exactly where Pokémon spawned and how much time was left until they despawned; the site used data hacked directly from the game.In the five days following the website\'s launch, 27 million unique visitors used the site.On July 31, multiple search apps and sites, including Pokévision, were disabled as they violated Niantic\'s terms of service.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Niantic responded by implementing changes and new features in the game which allowed players to easily play remotely.However, starting on August 1, 2021, Niantic began rolling back these changes as part of their Exploration Bonus Updates.Players in New Zealand and the United States were the first to receive the post-pandemic changes, and gradually, they were rolled out to the rest of the world ""in accordance with recommendations from global health organizations.""In fear of violations in health and personal safety regulations, as well as negatively impacting players with disabilities, the company has since received heavy criticism from the player base (including top players Brandon Tan and Nick Oyzon) due to their reverting safety measures implemented during the pandemic, in which gym and Pokéstop interaction distances were increased from 40 to 80 metres.Despite increasing rates of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in various U.S. states (resulting in overflowing hospitals), Niantic are firm on not keeping the pandemic bonuses.Players began boycotting Pokémon Go since in first week of August 2021.\n\nOn Twitter, the #HearUsNiantic started trending worldwide as fans and players voiced their censure towards Niantic\'s decision to remove the pandemic bonuses.A letter was sent to Niantic, which responded to the community by stating that the pandemic changes will not stay.As Niantic are an AR company, part of their business strategy is to sell user data by players after completing AR Mapping tasks where they can log their surroundings at marked PokéStops in their in-game maps.The reduced distance means an increased potential for Niantic to generate more revenue.Another reason for their changes is for Niantic to preserve their image of being an AR tech giant; on their blog post they stated that it is their ""mission"" to ""encourage outdoor exploration"" and ""to connect [people] to real places in the real world, and to visit places that are worth exploring.""Players have also speculated that Niantic is rolling back the pandemic bonuses to send players closer to sponsored businesses such as McDonald\'s (marked by a PokéStop or gym), from which Niantic has made a lot of money.\n\nList of

launched with around 150 species of Pokémon, which had increased to around 700 by 2021.\n\nPokémon Go was released to mixed reviews; critics praised the concept but criticized technical problems.It was one of the most used and profitable mobile apps in 2016, having been downloaded more than 500 million times worldwide by the end of the year.It is credited with popularizing location-based and AR technology, promoting physical activity, and helping local businesses grow due to escalated foot traffic.However, it attracted controversy for contributing to accidents and creating public nuisances.Various governments expressed concerns about security, and some countries regulate its use.The game had over monthly active users by May 2018, over a billion global downloads by early 2019, and grossed more than in revenue by 2020.\n\nAfter establishing a game account, players create and customize their own avatars.Once created, an avatar is displayed on a map based on the player\'s geographical location.Features on the map include \'PokéStops\' and \'Pokémon Gyms\'.These PokéStops can be equipped with items called \'Lure Modules\', which attract additional wild, and occasionally rare, Pokémon.Gyms serve as battle locations for team-based king of the hill matches.PokéStops and Gyms are typically located at places of interest.These locations were initially re-purposed portals from Ingress, Niantic\'s previous augmented reality (AR) game.This has led to PokéStops and Pokémon Gyms being placed at dangerous or inconvenient locations, such as a now-deleted Gym at the Korean Demilitarized Zone and Bagram Airforce Base, which was abandoned by U.S. forces in July 2021.Since 2019, these locations also include submissions from Go players which are largely reviewed by other players.\n\nAs players move within their real world surroundings, their avatars move within the game\'s map.Different Pokémon species reside in different areas of the world; for example, Water-type Pokémon are generally found near water.When a player encounters a Pokémon, it may be viewed either in AR mode or with a live rendered, generic background.AR mode uses the camera and gyroscope on the player\'s mobile device to display an image of a Pokémon as though it were in the real world.Players can take screenshots of the Pokémon they encounter either with or without the AR mode activated.\n\nAlthough the game is free to play, it supports in-app purchases, where players can purchase additional Poké Balls and other in-game items.These items include Incense, which attracts Pokémon to the player as they move for sixty minutes, Lure Modules, which players use at PokéStops to attract Pokémon to their current location near the PokeStop, and Lucky Eggs, which double experience points gained for a thirty-minute period from use.All Pokémon are displayed with a Combat Power, which is a rough measure of how powerful that Pokémon is in battle.Generally, as players level up, they catch Pokémon with higher CP and Pokémon are somewhat harder to catch.The player can check how strong their Pokémon are by the ""Appraisal"" system.\n\nPlayers can customize their avatar\'s appearance with clothing options that differ in availability according to season, player level, and game sponsors.Clothing includes: hats, accessories, tops, bottoms, socks, footwear and bags.Most clothing aligns with either the look of a specific Pokémon, a specific team and/or Pokémon region.Many pieces of clothing are free, but pieces can also be purchased using coins, earned during select events, awarded as the player levels up, or received as a prize for special research completion.\n\nAnother way for a player to customize their avatar is with a pose.Poses, like clothing, are free, purchased, or awarded.Certain poses are event based and can only be earned during the event they are attached to.Once the event is over, there is no guarantee that the pose will be available in-game again.\n\nIn April 2024, Pokémon GO was updated to allow greater customization of player avatars.Customization now includes a limited number of different hair styles, the ability to adjust the weight of the avatar, and expanded options for skin color.This update was met with mass backlash from the playerbase, as the new avatars were perceived to be of inferior graphical quality in comparison to the outgoing models, and because the updated models interfered with some pre-update cosmetic items, of which many had been purchased by players.\n\nUnlike most other installments in the Pokémon series, players in Pokémon Go do not battle wild Pokémon to catch them.During an encounter with a wild Pokémon, a player may throw a Poké Ball at it by flicking it from the bottom of the screen up toward the Pokémon.If the Pokémon is caught, it will come under the ownership of the player.Factors in the success rate of catching a Pokémon include the Pokémon\'s catch rate, the timing, the type of Poké Ball used, etc.After catching a wild Pokémon, the player is awarded two types of in-game currencies: Candies and Stardust.The Candies awarded by a successful catch depend on what evolutionary chain a Pokémon belongs to.A player can use Stardust and Candies to raise a Pokémon\'s level and hence ""Combat Power"" (CP).However, only Candies are needed to evolve a Pokémon, except for certain Pokémon that might need special items.Each Pokémon evolution tree has its own type of Candy, which can only be used to evolve or level up.The maximum level a player can achieve was originally level 40, but expanded to 50 as of November 30, 2020.The player can also transfer the Pokémon back to the Pokémon Professor Willow to earn more Candies and create room for more Pokémon.Shiny Pokémon are available through multiple ways, mostly by chance.One popular goal of the game is to complete the entries in the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon logbook, by catching and evolving them to collect every one in it.\n\nIn September 2016, Niantic introduced a ""Buddy Pokémon"" feature, which allows players to pick a Pokémon to appear alongside them on the profile screen, and receive in-game rewards and bonuses based on the chosen Pokémon.The feature was released later that month.Certain Pokémon have different distances that they need to be walked in order to receive candy.The more the player walks in real time, the more candy they can earn.During the same update, Niantic made it impossible for players with rooted or jailbroken devices to log into the game in an effort to reduce and prevent cheating.\n\nOn January 20, 2018, Pokémon Go held the first Community Day, a monthly event that increases the appearance rate of a specific Pokémon and offer an exclusive move to the final evolution of the featured Pokémon only if caught or evolved during the event window.Players also have a higher chance to catch the Shiny variant of the featured Pokémon.The first Community Day featured Pikachu, with the exclusive move Surf to Raichu.\n\nThe game is regularly updated with new Pokémon, and as of March 25, 2022, there are just over 730 Pokémon in the game (not including regional varieties) out of a total 1008.\n\nRegional Pokémon are often released together, such as Hoenn region Pokémon released in December 2017, Alolan variants in May 2018, Sinnoh region Pokémon(along with the Sinnoh Stone item used to evolve them) released in October 2018, Unova region Pokémon (and the Unova Stone) in September 2019, Kalos region Pokémon in December 2020, and again more Alola region Pokémon in March 2022.\n\nMythical and legendary Pokémon are often released individually (or in pairs/trios) in special events or quests.The first Legendary Pokémon released was Groudon, in December 2017.The Mythical Pokémon Meltan and its evolved form, Melmetal are so far the only Pokémon to have made their debut on Pokémon Go.Their release coincided with the release of Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee!on the Nintendo Switch, Pokémon Go introduced the new Mythical Pokémon Meltan originally as a teaser, later to be available to capture only in Pokémon Go via a ""Mystery Box"" item that could be obtained through transferring Pokémon from Pokémon Go to either Nintendo Switch Pokémon games, or by completing new Research Tasks.\n\nIn August 2020, Mega Evolution came to Pokémon Go with four Pokémon able to Mega Evolve into five forms.\n\nPlayers earn experience points for various in-game activities.Players rise in level as they earn experience points (XP), with various features being progressively unlocked.Most-notably, at level five, the player can battle at a Pokémon Gym and join one of three color-coded teams (red for Team Valor, blue for Team Mystic, or yellow for Team Instinct), which act as factions battling for control of Gyms within the Pokémon Go world.\n\nIn June 2017, Niantic announced that the game mechanics of Gyms would be revamped for a more teamwork-oriented experience; Gyms were disabled on June 19, 2017, with the new Gyms being released with the next app update a few days later.As of the update, Gyms included a spinnable component to receive in-game items such as Potions and Poké Balls.Additionally, Gyms are capped at containing six Pokémon, each of which must be unique in that Gym.Coins are now earned based on the amount of time the defending Pokémon has been in a Gym, as opposed to a one-per-day gym defender bonus of 10 coins per current defending Pokémon.Legendary, Mythical and Buddy Pokémon cannot be placed in Gyms.\n\nIn July 2017, Raid Battles were introduced.Raid Battles consist of a group of players gathering to confront an over-leveled Pokémon located in a Gym.If the Pokémon is defeated, the players gain the chance to catch a regular version of it.Raid difficulties range from 1 to 5, with 1 being of the lowest difficulty, and 5 being the most difficult to defeat.Level 5 raids are exclusive to Legendary Pokémon.The first of these, Articuno and Lugia, were released on July 22, 2017, after the Go Fest, with Moltres and Zapdos following.From September to November, the 3 Legendary Beasts: Entei, Raikou and Suicune, were released shortly after, rotating regions every month.Following their departure, the Legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh appeared in Raid Battles from November 27, 2017, to December 12, 2017.In August 2020, level 3 Mega raids arrived with the introduction of Mega Evolution.At the same time, Level 2 and 4 raids were combined into Level 1 and 3 raids.\n\nIn May 2022, Raid Battle were updated to include the addition of Mega Legendary Pokémon, which were turned to 6 stars, the highest currently in the game.The only Pokémon included in these Raids were Mega Latios and Mega Latias.\n\nIn October 2022, a new form of raid battle called ""Elite Raids"" were introduced.Elite Raids differ to normal raids in a number of ways, most notably that they can only be battled in person, take 24 hours to start, and are extremely difficult, often requiring a large number of players to defeat the Pokémon.\n\nIn May 2023, another new form of raid battles were introduced called ""Shadow Raids"".Shadow Raids may only be battled in person and award the chance to catch a Shadow Pokémon upon defeat.During the battle, the Pokémon may become ""enraged"", increasing both attack and defence, but can be returned to normal using a ""Purified Gem"".\n\nIn December 2018, Niantic added player vs player Trainer Battles.In January 2020, Niantic rolled out an online battle format Go Battle League which allows players to fight other players worldwide.Unlike the Trainer Battles format introduced in 2018, Go Battle League does not require physical proximity, scanning QR code on each other\'s phone, knowing each other\'s friend code, or any other real-world interactions between players.Instead, participating players are automatically paired by the game server via some variant of the Elo rating system.\n\nIn July 2019, Pokémon Go introduced Team GO Rocket battles.Team GO Rocket NPCs could be battled at PokéStops indicated with it twitching and being a dark color or in Team GO Rocket Balloons which follow the player on the map.After victory, the player has the opportunity to capture a ""Shadow Pokémon"" which are relatively low-leveled, angry-looking Pokémon.Shadow Pokémon have a higher attack stat but a lower defense stat than a normal Pokémon.After capture, the player can choose to purify the Shadow Pokémon.Purified Pokémon are higher-leveled than their Shadow counterparts, can learn an exclusive move when purified, and need fewer candies to evolve.\n\nThe concept for the game was conceived in 2014 by Satoru Iwata of Nintendo and Tsunekazu Ishihara of The Pokémon Company as an April Fools\' Day collaboration with Google, called the Google Maps: Pokémon Challenge.Ishihara was a fan of developer Niantic\'s previous transreality game, Ingress, and saw the game\'s concept as a perfect match for the Pokémon series.Niantic, a subsidiary of Google, used the crowdsourced data from Ingress to populate the locations for PokéStops and gyms within Pokémon Go, data from Google Maps to spawn specific Pokémon on certain terrain, and map display from OpenStreetMap since December 2017.The game\'s application logic uses the open source Kubernetes system - and due to the game\'s sheer scale of users, a number of bugs with the Kubernetes system was discovered and later fixed.Niantic was spun off from Google as an independent company in 2015 following the company reorganization into Alphabet Inc.\n\nIn 2015, Ishihara dedicated his speech at the game\'s announcement on September 10 to Iwata, who had died two months earlier.Tatsuo Nomura, who joined Niantic in 2015 after he developed the Google Maps Pokémon Challenge, acted as Director and Product Manager for the game.The game\'s soundtrack was written by longtime Pokémon series composer, Junichi Masuda, who also assisted with some of the game\'s design.Among the game\'s graphic designers was Dennis Hwang, who previously created the logo of Gmail while working for Google.\n\nOn March 4, 2016, Niantic announced a Japan-exclusive beta test would begin later that month, allowing players to assist in refining the game before its full release.The beta test was later expanded to other countries.On April 7, it was announced that the beta would expand to Australia and New Zealand.Then, on May 16, the signups for the field test were opened to the United States.The test came to an end on June 30.\n\nAt the Comic-Con 2016, John Hanke, founder of Niantic, revealed the appearances of the three team leaders: Candela (Team Valor), Blanche (Team Mystic), and Spark (Team Instinct).Hanke conveyed that approximately 10% of the ideas for the game were implemented.Future updates, including the addition of trading, more Pokémon, implementation of Pokémon Centers at PokéStops, a patch for the ""three step glitch"", and easier training, were also confirmed.He also stated that Niantic would be continuing support for the game for ""years to come"".In an interview with TechCrunch in September 2016, Hanke hinted that player vs. player Pokémon battles would be released in a future update.In December 2016, coffeehouse chain Starbucks and telecommunications company Sprint collaborated with Nintendo to add PokéStops and gyms at certain locations of theirs throughout the United States.That same month, a companion app for Apple Watch devices was released, which allows users to receive notifications about nearby Pokémon, but does not allow for them to be caught.In January 2017, an additional 5,000 more Starbucks locations became available as gyms.In February 2017, an update was released which introduced over 100 species based in the Johto region from the second generation of the core Pokémon series, which were added alongside the original 151.The update also included the addition of new berries, new Pokémon encounter mechanics, and an expanded selection of avatar clothing options.Some of the Pokémon introduced in Ruby and Sapphire were added in late 2017, starting with a Halloween event in October and 50 more in December.A weather system was added alongside the latter, allowing real-world weather to affect gameplay.In November 2018, a game developed by Game Freak and heavily inspired by Pokémon Go, Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee! was released on the Nintendo Switch.This game will feature Pokémon Go style catching with Joy-Con and there has integration between the two games.In addition, new Pokémon Meltan was revealed in September, becoming the first new Pokémon to be released through Pokémon Go.On October 10, 2018, The Pokémon Company and Niantic announced plans to introduce Pokémon from Diamond and Pearl into Pokémon Go.On October 12, Niantic teased one of the Generation IV Pokémon that would be coming to Pokémon Go.On October 25, a feature known as Adventure Sync was announced, which will record the player\'s walking data in the background.On October 26, Niantic announced research tasks for Bug type Pokémon that will give players a chance to catch Shedinja throughout November.\n\nAccording to John Hanke in a January 2019 interview with Business Insider, 2018 saw Go become the game initially envisioned by Niantic.\n\nIn 2020, Niantic made major changes to gameplay mechanisms to account for the COVID-19 pandemic which saw many players unable to leave their homes to play.These development shift saw changes like the addition of indoor step tracking to count toward in-game distance challenges, long distance PVP battles, increased ""incense"" effectiveness, increased spawn points, and a doubled player radius.\n\nThe Pokémon Go Plus is a Bluetooth Low Energy wearable device, developed by Nintendo\'s Platform Technology Development division, that allows players to perform certain actions in the game without looking at their smart device.When a player is near a Pokémon or PokéStop, the Plus vibrates.The player can then press the button to capture the Pokémon or receive items from the PokéStop; the player cannot check what they have received until the next time they sign into the app onto their mobile device.The design consists of a Poké Ball and the shape of the Google Maps pin.The decision to create the device rather than create a smartwatch app was to increase uptake among players for whom a smartwatch is prohibitively expensive.It was released in the United Kingdom and North America on September 16, 2016.\n\nThe game\'s official launch began on July 6, 2016, with releases in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.Due to server strain from high demand upon release, Niantic CEO John Hanke stated that the release in other regions was to be ""paused until Niantic was comfortable"" fixing the issues.European releases started on July 13, and the game became available to most of the continent over the following ten days.The Japanese launch was initially reported to be on July 20; however, the game was delayed after a sponsorship deal with fast food chain McDonald\'s was leaked, instead releasing two days later.Although the game was proposed to be released in France on July 15, it was postponed until July 24 out of respect and due to safety concerns following a terrorist attack in Nice on July 14.Following the shut down of third-party apps and websites in late-July 2016—significantly reducing server strain—Niantic was able to continue pushing release worldwide.Central and South America and most of Southeast Asia subsequently saw releases in early August.Indonesia was the first Asian country to have the game playable, despite the game not being officially released in that region until August 6.\n\nIn South Korea, the game was not officially released as major restrictions on the use of online mapping data exist.However, due to a glitch, a small area around Sokcho in the northeastern part of the country was considered a part of Niantic\'s North Korea mapping region, making the game fully playable in that area.Numerous people took advantage of the gap to play the game.Bus tickets from the capital city of Seoul sold out and people living within Sokcho shared information on free Wi-Fi areas to tourists.Players also discovered a gym in Panmunjom, along the Korean Demilitarized Zone; however, Niantic later removed it from the game.Following the release of Pokémon Go in Japan, parts of Busan also became playable as parts of the city are considered part of Japan\'s mapping area due to the proximity of Tsushima Island.The game officially released in the country in January 2017.\n\nIn mainland China, Google services are banned by the Great Firewall, whereas the GPS function in the game is blocked by Niantic.Players of Pokémon Go in China have to download the game with App Store IDs from other regions and use VPN to access Google services in order to load the game, and some even use a GPS spoofing app to bypass the GPS blocking.Some players also downloaded a clone app called City Spirit Go, which was released shortly after Pokémon Go beta test in Japan.As of 2020, the official game is still unplayable in most parts of China with GPS modules being blocked in-game.\n\nDuring its launch in Southeast Asia in August 2016, the game officially excluded Myanmar, but users in Thailand discovered that the game was fully playable in border cities near the nation.The game was released in the Balkans, Macau, and Central Asia in September 2016, and was also released throughout Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia by the end of the year.\n\nOn September 11, 2018, the game appeared in Russia\'s App Store and Google Play Store over two years after the first launch.However, Niantic did not officially announce the release.\n\nIn May 2019, the game was released on the Samsung Galaxy Store.\n\nInvestors were buoyed by the response to the initial release of Pokémon Go on July 7, with Nintendo\'s share price rising by an initial 10% and by July 14 shares rose to as high as 50%.Despite Nintendo only owning a 32% stake in The Pokémon Company and an undisclosed stake in Niantic, Nintendo\'s market value increased by US$9 billion within five days of release of Pokémon Go.The trend continued for more than a week after the game\'s release and by July 19, the stock value of Nintendo more than doubled as compared to pre-release.Turnover sales reached a record-breaking ¥703.6 billion (US$6.6 billion); and trading of the stock accounted for a quarter of all trades on the Tokyo Stock Exchange\'s main board.The Financial Times believed that investors were speculating not on Pokémon Go as such, but on future Nintendo app releases being as successful as the company moves more into the mobile app market—an area they were historically reluctant to enter in the belief it would cannibalise its portable console and video game sales.Nintendo plans to release four more smartphone app games by March 2017, and investors remarked that Pokémon Go showed Nintendo still has some of the ""most valuable character intellectual property in the world"" with franchises such as Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid.\n\nBy July 22, Nintendo gained ¥1.8 trillion ($17.6 billion) in market capitalization since the game\'s launch.However, following clarification from Nintendo that the company did not produce Pokémon Go nor had tangible financial gains from it, its stock fell by 18%—equating to a ¥708 billion ($6.7 billion) loss in market value—on July 25.This was the largest single-day decline for Nintendo since 1990 and the maximum one-day exchange of finances allowed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.The company has an approximate 13% ""effective economic stake"" in the game, according to Macquarie Securities.\n\nThe surge in stocks extended beyond Nintendo, with Tomy, TV Tokyo, and the Bank of Kyoto, among other companies, all seeing significant gains.Similarly, Zagg, which owns a company that manufactures battery cases, saw a 25% rise in its stock in relation to Pokémon Go.\n\nAt launch, the game suffered from frequent server outages due to extreme usage.The global server usage expectation for the game was surpassed within 15 minutes of the game\'s release in Australia and New Zealand, and peaked at 50 times expected traffic, or 10 times the expected worst-case scenario.Frequent crashes and authentication errors plagued the game\'s release and persisted for several days.For the first two days after launch, players were unable to access the game through their Pokémon Trainer Club accounts; only Gmail-based accounts were able to gain access to the game.Servers again suffered frequent outages in Australia on July 11; players blamed people in the United Kingdom for bypassing local servers and using Australian ones to play the game before its official release.On July 16, a few hours after the release in many European countries, the game\'s servers temporarily went down.The outage was claimed by a hacking group called ""PoodleCorp"", who said they used a DDoS attack to take them down, although the problem was fixed later that day.The next day, the servers went down again as the game was launched in Canada.John Hanke issued an apology for the server issues at San Diego Comic Con 2016, stating ""we weren\'t provisioned for what happened"".\n\nSome early iOS installs of Pokémon Go required users to provide the app with full access to their Google accounts, thereby allowing the app to ""access players\' Gmail-based email, Google Drive-based files, photos and videos stored in Google Photos, and any other content within their Google accounts"".The Pokémon Company and Niantic responded to the concerns, recognizing that the iOS app, at the time, ""... erroneously requests full access permission for the user\'s Google account ...""However, Adam Reeve—the person who initially made claims of the security issues in a Tumblr post—later backtracked on his claim and was not ""100 percent sure"" it was valid.Dan Guido, CEO of the security company Trail of Bits, analyzed the app\'s programming and discovered that although the game did request full account access, this did not enable third-party usage as initially conveyed.Guido found that this did enable Niantic to access people\'s email addresses and phone numbers unintentionally.A subsequent iOS app update reduced the scope of access.Niantic also issued a statement assuring users that no information was collected nor was any information beyond what was necessary to use the app accessed.\n\nAlongside server issues, Pokémon Go suffered from several glitches.One of the more prominent bugs appeared in mid-July 2016 and rendered the game\'s tracking feature useless.Normally, this feature shows between zero and three footprints to inform the player of how close they are to a nearby Pokémon; however, it universally became ""stuck"" at three steps, earning it the name ""three-step-glitch"".Niantic removed the footstep feature altogether on July 30, sparking criticism from players.By August 1, players reported a new glitch that swaps their captured Pokémon with another creature at random.Another bug, confirmed by Niantic in August, inadvertently made capturing Pokémon more difficult.Some legendary Pokémon, which are rare and powerful versions of the creatures, were also obtained by players in a glitch, though they were later removed from the accounts of the trainers to keep the game fair.\n\nPokémon Go released to ""mixed or average"" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.Upon release, critics called the experience enjoyable, but noted the game\'s technical issues.\n\nCritics praised various aspects of Pokémon Go.Oscar Dayus (Pocket Gamer) said that the game was an immensely enjoyable experience and continued with how ""the very personal nature of catching Pokémon in your own neighborhood made me smile more than any game has for years"".Jeremy Parish (US Gamer) compared the game and its social aspects to a massively multiplayer online game.Reviewers also praised the game enabling the promotion of physical exercise.Terri Schwartz (IGN) said it was ""secretly the best exercise app out there"" and that it changed her daily walking routine.Patrick Allen (Lifehacker) wrote an article with tips about how to work out using Pokémon Go.Julia Belluz (Vox) said it could be the ""greatest unintentional health fad ever"" and wrote that one of the results of the game that the developers may not have realized was that ""it seems to be getting people moving"".Users took an extra 194 steps per day once they started using the app, which approximated to 26% more than usual.IGN named it the 100th best video game of all time in 2018.\n\nPhilip Kollar and Allegra Frank (Polygon) both agreed that Pokémon Go was ""an exciting social experience"", but were not sure how long the game and its popularity would last, stating it could either last for coming years or ""end up as a brush fire craze that the whole gaming world is talking about for a few weeks and then is forgotten"".\n\nOther critics expressed more negative opinions of the game, with many citing frequent crashes and other technical issues, along with shallow gameplay.Kallie Plagge (IGN) said that although the game lacked in polish and depth, the overall experience made up for it.Matt Peckham (Time) criticized the game for its frequent crashes.Mike Cosimano (Destructoid) also took issue with the game, saying the original idea showed promise, but was improperly executed.Kat Brewster (The Guardian) wrote that although she thought Pokémon Go was not a good game, it was ""a great experience"".The server problems also received negative press.Miguel Concepcion (GameSpot) said that although he enjoyed the game\'s strong social appeal and visual design, the game\'s ""initial iteration is a buggy mess on all levels"", with one of the reasons being the constant server problems.Another glitch that appeared a few days after launch was the ""three-step glitch"", which made it impossible to ""hunt down a specific Pokémon"".Patricia Hernandez (Kotaku) said, ""the three step glitch adds to what has been a terrible launch for Pokémon Go"".Critics also emphasized on the large gap between the rural and urban players.Rural players seem to be at a major disadvantage when playing the game, while city players have access to more PokéStops and Gyms.\n\nPokémon Go rapidly rose the American iOS App Store\'s ""Top Grossing"" and ""Free"" charts.The game has become the fastest game to top the App Store and Google Play, beating Clash Royale, and it became the most downloaded app on the App Store of any app in their first week.Within two days of release, it was installed on more than 5% of Android devices in the United States, according to SimilarWeb, According to Sensor Tower, the game was downloaded more than 10 million times within a week of release, becoming the fastest such app to do so, and reached 15 million global downloads by July 13.According to SurveyMonkey the game became the most active mobile game in the United States ever with 21 million active users on July 12, eclipsing Candy Crush Sagas peak of 20 million.By July 15, approximately 1.3 million people were playing the game in the Netherlands, despite the app not being officially released in the country at the time.On the day of release in Japan, more than 10 million people downloaded the game, including 1.3 million in the first three hours.By July 31, the game exceeded 100 million downloads worldwide, according to App Annie and Sensor Tower.On August 8, Pokémon Go reached the milestone of over 100 million downloads on Google Play alone after barely 33 days on the market.\n\nThrough in-game purchases, the game generated more than by the end of July 2016, with App Annie reporting that Pokémon Go had generated around in revenue every day that month.The same month, Sensor Tower reported that the game had passed more than in worldwide revenue, beating every existing record set by Clash of Clans and Candy Crush by a wide margin.On August 12, 2016, the Financial Times reported that Pokémon Go reached in revenue after five weeks counting only the U.S., British, and German markets.The average daily usage of the app on Android devices in July 2016 exceeded that of Snapchat, Tinder, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.Due by the game\'s massive popularity, several app developers became focused on developing similar AR apps using available software development kits (SDK).By September 2, 2016, Pokémon Go had generated more than $440 million in worldwide revenue, according to Sensor Tower.By September 30, it had received downloads and grossed in 80 days, according to market research firm Newzoo.Pokémon Go reached the milestone of $600 million in revenue after only 90 days on the market, becoming the fastest mobile game ever to do so.\n\nBesides in-game purchases, partnerships with retail chains like Starbucks, McDonald\'s, Sprint, pay Niantic Labs for ""Foot Traffic"" on-demand of the retail shops.\n\nThe game was awarded five Guinness World Records in August 2016: most revenue grossed by a mobile game in its first month (); most downloaded mobile game in its first month (130 million downloads); most international charts topped simultaneously for a mobile game in its first month (top game in 70 different countries); most international charts topped simultaneously for a mobile game in its first month (top grossing in 55 countries simultaneously); and fastest time to gross $100 million by a mobile game (reached in 20 days on July 26).By September 2016, Pokémon Go had been downloaded over 500 million times worldwide, and became the fastest game to make over $500 million in revenue.Pokémon Go was awarded the App Store\'s breakout hit of 2016.Pokémon Go was reported to be the most searched game on Google in 2016.\n\nUsage of the game in the United States peaked on July 15, and by mid-September, had lost 79% of its players there.Forbes said ""the vaguely curious stopped playing and the more committed players ran up against a fairly unsatisfying endgame"".In October 2016, Niantic released a Halloween-themed event, which saw a surge in revenue up to 133% as reported by Sensor Tower, placing the game back to top of the charts of highest grossing apps.It was reported that the game earned approximately $23.3 million between October 25 and 29, up from approximately $10 million between October 18 and 22.According to App Annie, Pokémon Go grossed an estimated in 2016.\n\nIn February 2017, Pokémon Go was awarded being the best app at the Crunchies award event.By February 2017, the game has been downloaded more than times worldwide, with a reported in revenue made, becoming the fastest mobile game ever to do so.By June 2017, the game was downloaded more than 750 million times, with an estimated revenue of according to Apptopia.According to mobile app research firm Apptopia, approximately 60 million users were still playing the game a year after launch.In May 2018, The Pokémon Company announced that the game reached over 800million downloads worldwide.Forbes estimated that the game may have come close to 900million downloads by September 2018.The top five countries where it has received the most downloads are the United States (21%), Brazil (9.3%), India (8.6%), Mexico (5.5%), and Indonesia (5%).As of February 2019, the game has been downloaded by over 1billion people worldwide.\n\nA report from SuperData Research ranked Pokémon Go as the 9th highest grossing mobile game of 2017, with an annual revenue of .Bloomberg estimated that Pokémon Go generated up to in total revenue by late 2017.Two years from its initial launch, analyst firm Sensor Tower estimated the game had grossed over from in-app purchases, reporting that players around the world continue to spend each day.SuperData Research reported that, in May 2018, Pokémon Go grossed in monthly revenue and had monthly active players, its highest since Summer 2016.In July 2018, Pokémon Go was the top-grossing mobile app of the month.Since the introduction of trading and friends features, Sensor Tower has reported that players spend an average of per day.Apptopia reported that, by September 2018, the game had grossed over from in-app purchases; the top five countries where it has received the most revenue are Japan (), the United States (), Germany (), the United Kingdom (), and Australia ().It was the fourth highest-grossing game of 2018, with , and in 2019 alone Pokémon Go earned , according to Superdata Research, a division of Nielsen Media Research.Pokémon Go live events earned in tourism revenue during 2019.According to Sensor Tower in November 2020, Pokémon Go had accumulated nearly unique installs and generated almost in revenue from in-game purchases via the iOS App Store and Google Play.Its largest market in terms of both installs and revenue is the United States, followed by Japan and Germany in revenue and by Brazil and Mexico in installs.\n\nDuring 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic causing restrictions on the ability of players to play Go outside their homes, Niantic implemented new features which allowed players to play the game from inside their homes, and this was credited with increasing its playerbase throughout the year despite the restrictions.Despite a brief drop early in the pandemic, the number of monthly active users of the game rose by 45 percent between January and August 2020, and the game\'s revenue in 2020 was the highest in its history, exceeding even its 2016 revenue.The game generated more than of revenue in the first 10 months of 2020 according to Sensor Tower, and it was the top-grossing mobile game of December 2020.Pokémon Go was one of the top five highest-grossing games of 2020 with an annual revenue of according to SuperData Research, bringing the game\'s cumulative revenue to by 2020.The game generated a further in the first half of 2021.\n\nThe game was referred to as a ""social media phenomenon"" which has brought people together from all walks of life.231 million people engaged in 1.1 billion interactions that mentioned Pokémon Go on Facebook and Instagram in the month of July.Numerous media outlets referred to the surge in popularity as ""Pokémon Go Mania"", or simply ""Pokémania"".The massive popularity of the game resulted in several unusual positive effects.For example, the game placed players where they can help catch criminals and report crimes in progress, although it has also placed some in harm\'s way, and has even aided law enforcement\'s community relations, albeit with caveats.Businesses also benefited from the nearby presence of PokéStops (or them being PokéStops themselves) with the concomitant influx of people, and the intense exploration of communities has brought local history to the forefront.The game was also seen bringing its players to places of worship, as many Pokégyms are located there.Despite some criticism by religious leaders, this was received positively by religious groups, who saw it as reminding adherents to come and pray.Some establishments considered purchasing lures in the game to attract additional players to PokéStops on their property.Within a week of its release, a secondary market emerged for the game, both for the resell of high-level accounts on Craigslist and PlayerUp, and for the sale of expert advice on Thumbtack.Wireless provider T-Mobile US started an offer for free data for a year for Pokémon Go sessions, and Yelp added a filter that only shows businesses which have a PokéStop nearby.National parks across the United States saw an influx of visitors due to the game, with ""hundreds or thousands"" of people visiting the National Mall and Memorial Parks in Washington, D.C. on the weekend following Pokémon Go release in the country.Small museums with PokéStops placed at exhibits also reported increased attendance, such as the McNay Art Museum in San Antonio, Texas, and the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens in Boca Raton, Florida.Charity organizations also sought engagement from players, with animal shelters offering dog walks to people who want to hatch eggs.\n\nEduardo Paes, then-mayor of Rio de Janeiro, stated that he hoped the app would be released in Brazil before the start of the 2016 Summer Olympics in the city (and it was, on August 3), and United States presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton mentioned the app during their 2016 election campaigns.In late July 2016, during a public address, the President of Italy, Sergio Mattarella, compared a political issue about the date of an incoming referendum as preposterous as the hunt for the Pokémon.Shortly after the game\'s release, Bellator mixed martial artist Michael Page celebrated a knockout of his match opponent, Evangelista Santos by putting on a red Ash Ketchum-like hat and rolling a prop Poké Ball in Santos\'s direction.On July 25, Dwayne Johnson released a promo video featuring MatPat and Ali-A with himself as a tough, rare Pokémon.\n\nThe game was credited for popularizing AR, and was praised by genderfluid groups for letting the players choose a ""style"" instead of ""gender"".The game also had a positive impact among individuals with autism.The ""Pokémon Theme"" from the animated series saw a 630% increase in listeners on music streaming platform Spotify during the month of the game\'s release.Meanwhile, streaming services such as Hulu experienced an increased viewership of the Pokémon series and films.Nintendo reported that sales of the 3DS Pokémon games rose as a result of the game\'s popularity.A Twitch channel, Twitch Plays Pokémon Go, was created that mimics the crowd-played Twitch Plays Pokémon channel, allowing viewers to direct a virtual avatar in the game using an iPhone programmed to spoof its location.Niantic later issued permanent bans to those who cheated the game by means such as GPS spoofing and bots.Pokémon-themed pornography increased in popularity after the release of the game.xHamster, an adult video streaming website, reported that within 5 days of the game\'s release, Pokémon related terms were the most searched for videos.Another adult video streaming website, Pornhub, reported that Pokémon related searches spiked 136%.Pokémon Go was spoofed in the Maroon 5 music video, ""Don\'t Wanna Know"".In the 2016 Doctor Who Christmas special, ""The Return of Doctor Mysterio"", the Doctor creates a distraction by ""flood[ing] the downstairs with Pokémon"", causing the people to run off with their cell phones.In the episode ""Looking for Mr. Goodbart"" from the 28th season of The Simpsons, the people of Springfield become addicted to Peekimon Get, a parody of Pokémon Go.\n\nGos release resulted in a resurgence in popularity for the Pokémon franchise as a whole.The Pokémon Sun and Moon games for the Nintendo 3DS, released later in 2016, was the best-selling video game for the 3DS with over 16 million copies sold, and this was partly attributed to the new fans to the series brought in by Go.In an interview, director of Sun and Moon Shigeru Ohmori remarked that the Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon sequels were designed partly to facilitate entry for newcomers to the franchise brought in by Go.The first Pokémon games for the Nintendo Switch, Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee!, took significant inspirations from Go.A line of official Go merchandise was released in November 2019.\n\nIn addition to standard gameplay, the game has held several in-game and live events.The first live event officially held by Niantic was held in Charlotte, North Carolina, in May 2017.In July 2017, a community event was held in Grant Park, Chicago, in honor of the first anniversary of the game\'s release.Despite the fact that almost no information about the event, including ticket prices and attractions, was released by Niantic ahead of the ticket sale, over 20,000 tickets sold out within a half hour.During the event itself, attendees suffered connectivity issues and crashes, due to the heavy amount of localized cellular activity.Afterwards, Niantic announced that they would refund everybody who bought a ticket, as well as give them $100 of in-game currency.Following the event, around two dozen attendees filed suit against Niantic, seeking travel reimbursement.\n\nFollowing the event in Chicago, other events have been held in Chester, Yokohama, and San Jose.In September 2017, a series of events named ""Safari Zone"" was held in Unibail-Rodamco shopping centers in Oberhausen, Paris and Barcelona, with events the following month in Copenhagen, Prague, Stockholm and Amstelveen.\n\nIn January 2018, Niantic announced monthly community event Community Day which aims to get players to meet up in their local areas.During a multi-hour period, players can encounter more frequent wild spawns of a particular Pokémon, an exclusive move for that Pokémon (or its evolution), an increased probability for the shiny form of that Pokémon, and bonuses such as extra stardust or XP.The Community Days in 2018 featured Pikachu (January 20), Dratini (February 24), Bulbasaur (March 25), Mareep (April 15), Charmander (May 19), Larvitar (June 16), Squirtle (July 8), Eevee (August 11–12), Chikorita (September 22), Beldum (October 21), and Cyndaquil (November 10).\n\nPokémon Go in Syria is a photography series published in 2016 by Syrian artist Khaled Akil.Akil places Pokémon characters in destroyed Syrian streets as a reminder for a world lost behind the screen.While Pokémon Go was trending worldwide, Akil couldn\'t help but notice how the media forgot about the war in Syria, and visualised his idea in the form of digital collages.Khaled\'s Pokémon series quickly went viral across the globe after he posted it online.This photography series was exhibited in various locations including the American University Museum.\n\nThe app was criticized for using locations such as cemeteries and memorials as sites to catch Pokémon, including the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, Arlington National Cemetery, the ANZAC War Memorial, and Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.Niantic later removed content from sensitive areas such as the Hiroshima Memorial and Holocaust Museum.The game sparked complaints from Dutch company ProRail, who said that players entered their railway tracks, and fire stations told players to not impede their staff by congregating outside.\n\nThe game\'s distribution of PokéStops and gyms (derived from the portals in Ingress, Niantic\'s science fiction-themed AR game) was noted to be sparser in many minority neighborhoods in a reflection of American demographics.Players in rural areas also complained about the lack of Pokémon spawns, PokéStops, and gyms in their area.Pokémon Go was criticized for game accessibility issues by players with physical disabilities.The AbleGamers Foundation COO, Steve Spohn, said that when Pokémon Go was compared to other mobile games, it ""excludes disabled players to a significant degree"".\n\nPolice departments in various countries issued warnings, some tongue-in-cheek, regarding inattentive driving, trespassing, and being targeted by criminals due to being unaware of one\'s surroundings.In the state of New York, sex offenders are banned from playing the app while on parole.Bosnian players were warned to stay out of minefields left over from the 1990s Bosnian War.In Russia, a 21-year-old video blogger, Ruslan Sokolovsky, was arrested in September 2016 for two months after playing Pokémon Go at the Church of All Saints in Yekaterinburg, and eventually received a suspended sentence for three and a half years in prison for charges of blasphemy.\n\nPeople have suffered various injuries from accidents related to the game.In Japan, the first accident occurred within hours of the game\'s release.The first death in Japan attributed to Pokémon Go occurred in late August 2016.A distracted driver playing the game killed one woman and seriously injured another.The 39-year-old farmer did not notice the women crossing a street and struck them with his truck.The woman died of a broken neck.Japan\'s National Police Agency said it was the 79th Pokémon Go-related accident in the country.On August 11, 2016, a young girl in Cambodia was reportedly killed after being hit by a car while trying to capture a Pokémon on a road.The case was the first death related to Pokémon Go among Southeast Asian countries.In January 2017, Chinese-American civilian Jiansheng Chen was shot dead while playing Pokémon Go.\n\nAl-Azhar University in Cairo described the game as ""harmful mania.""A Cossack leader declared that it ""smacks of Satanism"", Kuwait banned the game from government sites, Indonesian officials deemed it a national security threat, and in Israel the IDF banned the game from Army bases out of security considerations.In Saudi Arabia, the General Secretariat of the Council of Senior Scholars declared, in light of a 2001 fatwa banning the Pokémon card game as a form of gambling, that the electronic app required a new ruling.This was also followed by both Indian and Malaysian Islamic leaders telling Indian and Malaysian Muslims to avoid the game.\n\nDuring Thailand\'s 2016 constitutional referendum polling, Pokémon Go players were told to refrain from entering polling stations.Thus the Thai National Broadcasting and Communications Commission intends to ask Niantic to remove Pokémon characters and PokéStops from locations such as government facilities, historic and religious sites, private property as well as dangerous spots such as narrow footpaths and rivers.Cambodia has banned the game in a former genocide site after Pokémon players showed up at the site.Vietnam has banned players from entering the government and defense offices.The Vietnamese Ministry of Information and Communications is also considering the game\'s negative impact to Vietnamese society, where many people left home at night, crossed the road or drove on the street with their eyes kept focused on phones, which brought the need to ban the game in the country.Following the move by other Southeast Asian neighbors, the Philippines also banned the game in all administration offices.According to a survey by Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF), around 4% of employers in Malaysia fired their staff for playing the game during working hours.\n\nRussia also voiced their concerns over the application, with Nikolay Nikiforov, the country\'s Minister of Communications and Mass Media, suspecting foreign intelligence agencies using the application to collect information, while some fundamentalist religious groups in the region claim it to be demonic.The Supreme Council of Virtual Space in Iran officially banned the game in August 2016 over security concerns.The same month, The Pentagon facility in U.S. restricted the use of the game on their property, citing security risks by collecting secret information.In the United Kingdom, 290 police incidents were reported to have occurred in July 2016 in the country due to the game.In September 2016, Niantic stopped supporting the CyanogenMod mobile operating system.This prevented users playing on CyanogenMod from playing the game from that point forward.\n\nIn India, the Gujarat High Court issued a notice to Niantic, the developer of the popular AR-based game, on the grounds of ""posing danger to public safety"".The notice was issued on a PIL (Public Interest Litigation) seeking a ban on the location-based AR reality game in India.In addition, a second PIL was filed against the developers of Pokémon Go for hurting religious sentiments by showing images of eggs in places of worship of different religious groups.But the Indian Government refused to ban the game.\n\nPokémon Gos targeted local advertising has been described by Shoshana Zuboff in The Age of Surveillance Capitalism as an experiment that initiated from Google to move targeted advertising from the digital domain (cost per click) into the physical domain (cost per visit) by the use of sponsored locations.""In the end we recognize that the probe was designed to explore the next frontier: the means of behavioral modification.The game about the game is, in fact, an experimental facsimile of surveillance capitalism\'s design for our future.""\n\nMultiple unofficial, third-party apps were created to correspond with Pokémon Go.Notable apps include ""Poké Radar"" and ""Helper for Pokémon Go"", where players can crowdsource much of the Pokémon that can be found in the game at a particular time.At its peak of popularity, ""Poké Radar"" hit #2 on the Apple App Store, behind Pokémon Go itself.\n\nAnother app, GoChat, which allows players to leave messages for other players at specific locations, accrued more than 1 million downloads in five days and reached the top 10 in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.However, the app\'s developer Jonathan Zarra chose to leave the app unmonetized and had financial trouble keeping the app\'s servers online until bringing on angel investor and board member Michael Robertson.After acquiring significant funding, the app reached over 2 million active users.According to RiskIQ, at least 215 fake versions of the game were available by July 17, 2016.Several of these fake apps contained malicious programming and viruses.\n\nLaunched on July 22, 2016, ""Pokévision"" enabled players to find exactly where Pokémon spawned and how much time was left until they despawned; the site used data hacked directly from the game.In the five days following the website\'s launch, 27 million unique visitors used the site.On July 31, multiple search apps and sites, including Pokévision, were disabled as they violated Niantic\'s terms of service.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Niantic responded by implementing changes and new features in the game which allowed players to easily play remotely.However, starting on August 1, 2021, Niantic began rolling back these changes as part of their Exploration Bonus Updates.Players in New Zealand and the United States were the first to receive the post-pandemic changes, and gradually, they were rolled out to the rest of the world ""in accordance with recommendations from global health organizations.""In fear of violations in health and personal safety regulations, as well as negatively impacting players with disabilities, the company has since received heavy criticism from the player base (including top players Brandon Tan and Nick Oyzon) due to their reverting safety measures implemented during the pandemic, in which gym and Pokéstop interaction distances were increased from 40 to 80 metres.Despite increasing rates of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in various U.S. states (resulting in overflowing hospitals), Niantic are firm on not keeping the pandemic bonuses.Players began boycotting Pokémon Go since in first week of August 2021.\n\nOn Twitter, the #HearUsNiantic started trending worldwide as fans and players voiced their censure towards Niantic\'s decision to remove the pandemic bonuses.A letter was sent to Niantic, which responded to the community by stating that the pandemic changes will not stay.As Niantic are an AR company, part of their business strategy is to sell user data by players after completing AR Mapping tasks where they can log their surroundings at marked PokéStops in their in-game maps.The reduced distance means an increased potential for Niantic to generate more revenue.Another reason for their changes is for Niantic to preserve their image of being an AR tech giant; on their blog post they stated that it is their ""mission"" to ""encourage outdoor exploration"" and ""to connect [people] to real places in the real world, and to visit places that are worth exploring.""Players have also speculated that Niantic is rolling back the pandemic bonuses to send players closer to sponsored businesses such as McDonald\'s (marked by a PokéStop or gym), from which Niantic has made a lot of money.\n\nList of

55,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Pokémon Go', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'Pokémon Go (stylized as Pokémon GO) is a 2016 augmented reality (AR) mobile game, part of the Pokémon franchise, developed and published by Niantic in collaboration with Nintendo and The Pokémon Company for iOS and Android devices.It uses mobile devices with GPS to locate, capture, train, and battle virtual Pokémon, which appear as if they are in the player\'s real-world location.The game is free-to-play; it uses a freemium business model combined with local advertising and supports in-app purchases for additional in-game items.The game launched with around 150 species of Pokémon, which had increased to around 700 by 2021.\n\nPokémon Go was released to mixed reviews; critics praised the concept but criticized technical problems.It was one of the most used and profitable mobile apps in 2016, having been downloaded more than 500 million times worldwide by the end of the year.It is credited with popularizing location-based and AR technology, promoting physical activity, and helping local businesses grow due to escalated foot traffic.However, it attracted controversy for contributing to accidents and creating public nuisances.Various governments expressed concerns about security, and some countries regulate its use.The game had over monthly active users by May 2018, over a billion global downloads by early 2019, and grossed more than in revenue by 2020.\n\nAfter establishing a game account, players create and customize their own avatars.Once created, an avatar is displayed on a map based on the player\'s geographical location.Features on the map include \'PokéStops\' and \'Pokémon Gyms\'.These PokéStops can be equipped with items called \'Lure Modules\', which attract additional wild, and occasionally rare, Pokémon.Gyms serve as battle locations for team-based king of the hill matches.PokéStops and Gyms are typically located at places of interest.These locations were initially re-purposed portals from Ingress, Niantic\'s previous augmented reality (AR) game.This has led to PokéStops and Pokémon Gyms being placed at dangerous or inconvenient locations, such as a now-deleted Gym at the Korean Demilitarized Zone and Bagram Airforce Base, which was abandoned by U.S. forces in July 2021.Since 2019, these locations also include submissions from Go players which are largely reviewed by other players.\n\nAs players move within their real world surroundings, their avatars move within the game\'s map.Different Pokémon species reside in different areas of the world; for example, Water-type Pokémon are generally found near water.When a player encounters a Pokémon, it may be viewed either in AR mode or with a live rendered, generic background.AR mode uses the camera and gyroscope on the player\'s mobile device to display an image of a Pokémon as though it were in the real world.Players can take screenshots of the Pokémon they encounter either with or without the AR mode activated.\n\nAlthough the game is free to play, it supports in-app purchases, where players can purchase additional Poké Balls and other in-game items.These items include Incense, which attracts Pokémon to the player as they move for sixty minutes, Lure Modules, which players use at PokéStops to attract Pokémon to their current location near the PokeStop, and Lucky Eggs, which double experience points gained for a thirty-minute period from use.All Pokémon are displayed with a Combat Power, which is a rough measure of how powerful that Pokémon is in battle.Generally, as players level up, they catch Pokémon with higher CP and Pokémon are somewhat harder to catch.The player can check how strong their Pokémon are by the ""Appraisal"" system.\n\nPlayers can customize their avatar\'s appearance with clothing options that differ in availability according to season, player level, and game sponsors.Clothing includes: hats, accessories, tops, bottoms, socks, footwear and bags.Most clothing aligns with either the look of a specific Pokémon, a specific team and/or Pokémon region.Many pieces of clothing are free, but pieces can also be purchased using coins, earned during select events, awarded as the player levels up, or received as a prize for special research completion.\n\nAnother way for a player to customize their avatar is with a pose.Poses, like clothing, are free, purchased, or awarded.Certain poses are event based and can only be earned during the event they are attached to.Once the event is over, there is no guarantee that the pose will be available in-game again.\n\nIn April 2024, Pokémon GO was updated to allow greater customization of player avatars.Customization now includes a limited number of different hair styles, the ability to adjust the weight of the avatar, and expanded options for skin color.This update was met with mass backlash from the playerbase, as the new avatars were perceived to be of inferior graphical quality in comparison to the outgoing models, and because the updated models interfered with some pre-update cosmetic items, of which many had been purchased by players.\n\nUnlike most other installments in the Pokémon series, players in Pokémon Go do not battle wild Pokémon to catch them.During an encounter with a wild Pokémon, a player may throw a Poké Ball at it by flicking it from the bottom of the screen up toward the Pokémon.If the Pokémon is caught, it will come under the ownership of the player.Factors in the success rate of catching a Pokémon include the Pokémon\'s catch rate, the timing, the type of Poké Ball used, etc.After catching a wild Pokémon, the player is awarded two types of in-game currencies: Candies and Stardust.The Candies awarded by a successful catch depend on what evolutionary chain a Pokémon belongs to.A player can use Stardust and Candies to raise a Pokémon\'s level and hence ""Combat Power"" (CP).However, only Candies are needed to evolve a Pokémon, except for certain Pokémon that might need special items.Each Pokémon evolution tree has its own type of Candy, which can only be used to evolve or level up.The maximum level a player can achieve was originally level 40, but expanded to 50 as of November 30, 2020.The player can also transfer the Pokémon back to the Pokémon Professor Willow to earn more Candies and create room for more Pokémon.Shiny Pokémon are available through multiple ways, mostly by chance.One popular goal of the game is to complete the entries in the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon logbook, by catching and evolving them to collect every one in it.\n\nIn September 2016, Niantic introduced a ""Buddy Pokémon"" feature, which allows players to pick a Pokémon to appear alongside them on the profile screen, and receive in-game rewards and bonuses based on the chosen Pokémon.The feature was released later that month.Certain Pokémon have different distances that they need to be walked in order to receive candy.The more the player walks in real time, the more candy they can earn.During the same update, Niantic made it impossible for players with rooted or jailbroken devices to log into the game in an effort to reduce and prevent cheating.\n\nOn January 20, 2018, Pokémon Go held the first Community Day, a monthly event that increases the appearance rate of a specific Pokémon and offer an exclusive move to the final evolution of the featured Pokémon only if caught or evolved during the event window.Players also have a higher chance to catch the Shiny variant of the featured Pokémon.The first Community Day featured Pikachu, with the exclusive move Surf to Raichu.\n\nThe game is regularly updated with new Pokémon, and as of March 25, 2022, there are just over 730 Pokémon in the game (not including regional varieties) out of a total 1008.\n\nRegional Pokémon are often released together, such as Hoenn region Pokémon released in December 2017, Alolan variants in May 2018, Sinnoh region Pokémon(along with the Sinnoh Stone item used to evolve them) released in October 2018, Unova region Pokémon (and the Unova Stone) in September 2019, Kalos region Pokémon in December 2020, and again more Alola region Pokémon in March 2022.\n\nMythical and legendary Pokémon are often released individually (or in pairs/trios) in special events or quests.The first Legendary Pokémon released was Groudon, in December 2017.The Mythical Pokémon Meltan and its evolved form, Melmetal are so far the only Pokémon to have made their debut on Pokémon Go.Their release coincided with the release of Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee!on the Nintendo Switch, Pokémon Go introduced the new Mythical Pokémon Meltan originally as a teaser, later to be available to capture only in Pokémon Go via a ""Mystery Box"" item that could be obtained through transferring Pokémon from Pokémon Go to either Nintendo Switch Pokémon games, or by completing new Research Tasks.\n\nIn August 2020, Mega Evolution came to Pokémon Go with four Pokémon able to Mega Evolve into five forms.\n\nPlayers earn experience points for various in-game activities.Players rise in level as they earn experience points (XP), with various features being progressively unlocked.Most-notably, at level five, the player can battle at a Pokémon Gym and join one of three color-coded teams (red for Team Valor, blue for Team Mystic, or yellow for Team Instinct), which act as factions battling for control of Gyms within the Pokémon Go world.\n\nIn June 2017, Niantic announced that the game mechanics of Gyms would be revamped for a more teamwork-oriented experience; Gyms were disabled on June 19, 2017, with the new Gyms being released with the next app update a few days later.As of the update, Gyms included a spinnable component to receive in-game items such as Potions and Poké Balls.Additionally, Gyms are capped at containing six Pokémon, each of which must be unique in that Gym.Coins are now earned based on the amount of time the defending Pokémon has been in a Gym, as opposed to a one-per-day gym defender bonus of 10 coins per current defending Pokémon.Legendary, Mythical and Buddy Pokémon cannot be placed in Gyms.\n\nIn July 2017, Raid Battles were introduced.Raid Battles consist of a group of players gathering to confront an over-leveled Pokémon located in a Gym.If the Pokémon is defeated, the players gain the chance to catch a regular version of it.Raid difficulties range from 1 to 5, with 1 being of the lowest difficulty, and 5 being the most difficult to defeat.Level 5 raids are exclusive to Legendary Pokémon.The first of these, Articuno and Lugia, were released on July 22, 2017, after the Go Fest, with Moltres and Zapdos following.From September to November, the 3 Legendary Beasts: Entei, Raikou and Suicune, were released shortly after, rotating regions every month.Following their departure, the Legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh appeared in Raid Battles from November 27, 2017, to December 12, 2017.In August 2020, level 3 Mega raids arrived with the introduction of Mega Evolution.At the same time, Level 2 and 4 raids were combined into Level 1 and 3 raids.\n\nIn May 2022, Raid Battle were updated to include the addition of Mega Legendary Pokémon, which were turned to 6 stars, the highest currently in the game.The only Pokémon included in these Raids were Mega Latios and Mega Latias.\n\nIn October 2022, a new form of raid battle called ""Elite Raids"" were introduced.Elite Raids differ to normal raids in a number of ways, most notably that they can only be battled in person, take 24 hours to start, and are extremely difficult, often requiring a large number of players to defeat the Pokémon.\n\nIn May 2023, another new form of raid battles were introduced called ""Shadow Raids"".Shadow Raids may only be battled in person and award the chance to catch a Shadow Pokémon upon defeat.During the battle, the Pokémon may become ""enraged"", increasing both attack and defence, but can be returned to normal using a ""Purified Gem"".\n\nIn December 2018, Niantic added player vs player Trainer Battles.In January 2020, Niantic rolled out an online battle format Go Battle League which allows players to fight other players worldwide.Unlike the Trainer Battles format introduced in 2018, Go Battle League does not require physical proximity, scanning QR code on each other\'s phone, knowing each other\'s friend code, or any other real-world interactions between players.Instead, participating players are automatically paired by the game server via some variant of the Elo rating system.\n\nIn July 2019, Pokémon Go introduced Team GO Rocket battles.Team GO Rocket NPCs could be battled at PokéStops indicated with it twitching and being a dark color or in Team GO Rocket Balloons which follow the player on the map.After victory, the player has the opportunity to capture a ""Shadow Pokémon"" which are relatively low-leveled, angry-looking Pokémon.Shadow Pokémon have a higher attack stat but a lower defense stat than a normal Pokémon.After capture, the player can choose to purify the Shadow Pokémon.Purified Pokémon are higher-leveled than their Shadow counterparts, can learn an exclusive move when purified, and need fewer candies to evolve.\n\nThe concept for the game was conceived in 2014 by Satoru Iwata of Nintendo and Tsunekazu Ishihara of The Pokémon Company as an April Fools\' Day collaboration with Google, called the Google Maps: Pokémon Challenge.Ishihara was a fan of developer Niantic\'s previous transreality game, Ingress, and saw the game\'s concept as a perfect match for the Pokémon series.Niantic, a subsidiary of Google, used the crowdsourced data from Ingress to populate the locations for PokéStops and gyms within Pokémon Go, data from Google Maps to spawn specific Pokémon on certain terrain, and map display from OpenStreetMap since December 2017.The game\'s application logic uses the open source Kubernetes system - and due to the game\'s sheer scale of users, a number of bugs with the Kubernetes system was discovered and later fixed.Niantic was spun off from Google as an independent company in 2015 following the company reorganization into Alphabet Inc.\n\nIn 2015, Ishihara dedicated his speech at the game\'s announcement on September 10 to Iwata, who had died two months earlier.Tatsuo Nomura, who joined Niantic in 2015 after he developed the Google Maps Pokémon Challenge, acted as Director and Product Manager for the game.The game\'s soundtrack was written by longtime Pokémon series composer, Junichi Masuda, who also assisted with some of the game\'s design.Among the game\'s graphic designers was Dennis Hwang, who previously created the logo of Gmail while working for Google.\n\nOn March 4, 2016, Niantic announced a Japan-exclusive beta test would begin later that month, allowing players to assist in refining the game before its full release.The beta test was later expanded to other countries.On April 7, it was announced that the beta would expand to Australia and New Zealand.Then, on May 16, the signups for the field test were opened to the United States.The test came to an end on June 30.\n\nAt the Comic-Con 2016, John Hanke, founder of Niantic, revealed the appearances of the three team leaders: Candela (Team Valor), Blanche (Team Mystic), and Spark (Team Instinct).Hanke conveyed that approximately 10% of the ideas for the game were implemented.Future updates, including the addition of trading, more Pokémon, implementation of Pokémon Centers at PokéStops, a patch for the ""three step glitch"", and easier training, were also confirmed.He also stated that Niantic would be continuing support for the game for ""years to come"".In an interview with TechCrunch in September 2016, Hanke hinted that player vs. player Pokémon battles would be released in a future update.In December 2016, coffeehouse chain Starbucks and telecommunications company Sprint collaborated with Nintendo to add PokéStops and gyms at certain locations of theirs throughout the United States.That same month, a companion app for Apple Watch devices was released, which allows users to receive notifications about nearby Pokémon, but does not allow for them to be caught.In January 2017, an additional 5,000 more Starbucks locations became available as gyms.In February 2017, an update was released which introduced over 100 species based in the Johto region from the second generation of the core Pokémon series, which were added alongside the original 151.The update also included the addition of new berries, new Pokémon encounter mechanics, and an expanded selection of avatar clothing options.Some of the Pokémon introduced in Ruby and Sapphire were added in late 2017, starting with a Halloween event in October and 50 more in December.A weather system was added alongside the latter, allowing real-world weather to affect gameplay.In November 2018, a game developed by Game Freak and heavily inspired by Pokémon Go, Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee! was released on the Nintendo Switch.This game will feature Pokémon Go style catching with Joy-Con and there has integration between the two games.In addition, new Pokémon Meltan was revealed in September, becoming the first new Pokémon to be released through Pokémon Go.On October 10, 2018, The Pokémon Company and Niantic announced plans to introduce Pokémon from Diamond and Pearl into Pokémon Go.On October 12, Niantic teased one of the Generation IV Pokémon that would be coming to Pokémon Go.On October 25, a feature known as Adventure Sync was announced, which will record the player\'s walking data in the background.On October 26, Niantic announced research tasks for Bug type Pokémon that will give players a chance to catch Shedinja throughout November.\n\nAccording to John Hanke in a January 2019 interview with Business Insider, 2018 saw Go become the game initially envisioned by Niantic.\n\nIn 2020, Niantic made major changes to gameplay mechanisms to account for the COVID-19 pandemic which saw many players unable to leave their homes to play.These development shift saw changes like the addition of indoor step tracking to count toward in-game distance challenges, long distance PVP battles, increased ""incense"" effectiveness, increased spawn points, and a doubled player radius.\n\nThe Pokémon Go Plus is a Bluetooth Low Energy wearable device, developed by Nintendo\'s Platform Technology Development division, that allows players to perform certain actions in the game without looking at their smart device.When a player is near a Pokémon or PokéStop, the Plus vibrates.The player can then press the button to capture the Pokémon or receive items from the PokéStop; the player cannot check what they have received until the next time they sign into the app onto their mobile device.The design consists of a Poké Ball and the shape of the Google Maps pin.The decision to create the device rather than create a smartwatch app was to increase uptake among players for whom a smartwatch is prohibitively expensive.It was released in the United Kingdom and North America on September 16, 2016.\n\nThe game\'s official launch began on July 6, 2016, with releases in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.Due to server strain from high demand upon release, Niantic CEO John Hanke stated that the release in other regions was to be ""paused until Niantic was comfortable"" fixing the issues.European releases started on July 13, and the game became available to most of the continent over the following ten days.The Japanese launch was initially reported to be on July 20; however, the game was delayed after a sponsorship deal with fast food chain McDonald\'s was leaked, instead releasing two days later.Although the game was proposed to be released in France on July 15, it was postponed until July 24 out of respect and due to safety concerns following a terrorist attack in Nice on July 14.Following the shut down of third-party apps and websites in late-July 2016—significantly reducing server strain—Niantic was able to continue pushing release worldwide.Central and South America and most of Southeast Asia subsequently saw releases in early August.Indonesia was the first Asian country to have the game playable, despite the game not being officially released in that region until August 6.\n\nIn South Korea, the game was not officially released as major restrictions on the use of online mapping data exist.However, due to a glitch, a small area around Sokcho in the northeastern part of the country was considered a part of Niantic\'s North Korea mapping region, making the game fully playable in that area.Numerous people took advantage of the gap to play the game.Bus tickets from the capital city of Seoul sold out and people living within Sokcho shared information on free Wi-Fi areas to tourists.Players also discovered a gym in Panmunjom, along the Korean Demilitarized Zone; however, Niantic later removed it from the game.Following the release of Pokémon Go in Japan, parts of Busan also became playable as parts of the city are considered part of Japan\'s mapping area due to the proximity of Tsushima Island.The game officially released in the country in January 2017.\n\nIn mainland China, Google services are banned by the Great Firewall, whereas the GPS function in the game is blocked by Niantic.Players of Pokémon Go in China have to download the game with App Store IDs from other regions and use VPN to access Google services in order to load the game, and some even use a GPS spoofing app to bypass the GPS blocking.Some players also downloaded a clone app called City Spirit Go, which was released shortly after Pokémon Go beta test in Japan.As of 2020, the official game is still unplayable in most parts of China with GPS modules being blocked in-game.\n\nDuring its launch in Southeast Asia in August 2016, the game officially excluded Myanmar, but users in Thailand discovered that the game was fully playable in border cities near the nation.The game was released in the Balkans, Macau, and Central Asia in September 2016, and was also released throughout Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia by the end of the year.\n\nOn September 11, 2018, the game appeared in Russia\'s App Store and Google Play Store over two years after the first launch.However, Niantic did not officially announce the release.\n\nIn May 2019, the game was released on the Samsung Galaxy Store.\n\nInvestors were buoyed by the response to the initial release of Pokémon Go on July 7, with Nintendo\'s share price rising by an initial 10% and by July 14 shares rose to as high as 50%.Despite Nintendo only owning a 32% stake in The Pokémon Company and an undisclosed stake in Niantic, Nintendo\'s market value increased by US$9 billion within five days of release of Pokémon Go.The trend continued for more than a week after the game\'s release and by July 19, the stock value of Nintendo more than doubled as compared to pre-release.Turnover sales reached a record-breaking ¥703.6 billion (US$6.6 billion); and trading of the stock accounted for a quarter of all trades on the Tokyo Stock Exchange\'s main board.The Financial Times believed that investors were speculating not on Pokémon Go as such, but on future Nintendo app releases being as successful as the company moves more into the mobile app market—an area they were historically reluctant to enter in the belief it would cannibalise its portable console and video game sales.Nintendo plans to release four more smartphone app games by March 2017, and investors remarked that Pokémon Go showed Nintendo still has some of the ""most valuable character intellectual property in the world"" with franchises such as Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid.\n\nBy July 22, Nintendo gained ¥1.8 trillion ($17.6 billion) in market capitalization since the game\'s launch.However, following clarification from Nintendo that the company did not produce Pokémon Go nor had tangible financial gains from it, its stock fell by 18%—equating to a ¥708 billion ($6.7 billion) loss in market value—on July 25.This was the largest single-day decline for Nintendo since 1990 and the maximum one-day exchange of finances allowed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.The company has an approximate 13% ""effective economic stake"" in the game, according to Macquarie Securities.\n\nThe surge in stocks extended beyond Nintendo, with Tomy, TV Tokyo, and the Bank of Kyoto, among other companies, all seeing significant gains.Similarly, Zagg, which owns a company that manufactures battery cases, saw a 25% rise in its stock in relation to Pokémon Go.\n\nAt launch, the game suffered from frequent server outages due to extreme usage.The global server usage expectation for the game was surpassed within 15 minutes of the game\'s release in Australia and New Zealand, and peaked at 50 times expected traffic, or 10 times the expected worst-case scenario.Frequent crashes and authentication errors plagued the game\'s release and persisted for several days.For the first two days after launch, players were unable to access the game through their Pokémon Trainer Club accounts; only Gmail-based accounts were able to gain access to the game.Servers again suffered frequent outages in Australia on July 11; players blamed people in the United Kingdom for bypassing local servers and using Australian ones to play the game before its official release.On July 16, a few hours after the release in many European countries, the game\'s servers temporarily went down.The outage was claimed by a hacking group called ""PoodleCorp"", who said they used a DDoS attack to take them down, although the problem was fixed later that day.The next day, the servers went down again as the game was launched in Canada.John Hanke issued an apology for the server issues at San Diego Comic Con 2016, stating ""we weren\'t provisioned for what happened"".\n\nSome early iOS installs of Pokémon Go required users to provide the app with full access to their Google accounts, thereby allowing the app to ""access players\' Gmail-based email, Google Drive-based files, photos and videos stored in Google Photos, and any other content within their Google accounts"".The Pokémon Company and Niantic responded to the concerns, recognizing that the iOS app, at the time, ""... erroneously requests full access permission for the user\'s Google account ...""However, Adam Reeve—the person who initially made claims of the security issues in a Tumblr post—later backtracked on his claim and was not ""100 percent sure"" it was valid.Dan Guido, CEO of the security company Trail of Bits, analyzed the app\'s programming and discovered that although the game did request full account access, this did not enable third-party usage as initially conveyed.Guido found that this did enable Niantic to access people\'s email addresses and phone numbers unintentionally.A subsequent iOS app update reduced the scope of access.Niantic also issued a statement assuring users that no information was collected nor was any information beyond what was necessary to use the app accessed.\n\nAlongside server issues, Pokémon Go suffered from several glitches.One of the more prominent bugs appeared in mid-July 2016 and rendered the game\'s tracking feature useless.Normally, this feature shows between zero and three footprints to inform the player of how close they are to a nearby Pokémon; however, it universally became ""stuck"" at three steps, earning it the name ""three-step-glitch"".Niantic removed the footstep feature altogether on July 30, sparking criticism from players.By August 1, players reported a new glitch that swaps their captured Pokémon with another creature at random.Another bug, confirmed by Niantic in August, inadvertently made capturing Pokémon more difficult.Some legendary Pokémon, which are rare and powerful versions of the creatures, were also obtained by players in a glitch, though they were later removed from the accounts of the trainers to keep the game fair.\n\nPokémon Go released to ""mixed or average"" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.Upon release, critics called the experience enjoyable, but noted the game\'s technical issues.\n\nCritics praised various aspects of Pokémon Go.Oscar Dayus (Pocket Gamer) said that the game was an immensely enjoyable experience and continued with how ""the very personal nature of catching Pokémon in your own neighborhood made me smile more than any game has for years"".Jeremy Parish (US Gamer) compared the game and its social aspects to a massively multiplayer online game.Reviewers also praised the game enabling the promotion of physical exercise.Terri Schwartz (IGN) said it was ""secretly the best exercise app out there"" and that it changed her daily walking routine.Patrick Allen (Lifehacker) wrote an article with tips about how to work out using Pokémon Go.Julia Belluz (Vox) said it could be the ""greatest unintentional health fad ever"" and wrote that one of the results of the game that the developers may not have realized was that ""it seems to be getting people moving"".Users took an extra 194 steps per day once they started using the app, which approximated to 26% more than usual.IGN named it the 100th best video game of all time in 2018.\n\nPhilip Kollar and Allegra Frank (Polygon) both agreed that Pokémon Go was ""an exciting social experience"", but were not sure how long the game and its popularity would last, stating it could either last for coming years or ""end up as a brush fire craze that the whole gaming world is talking about for a few weeks and then is forgotten"".\n\nOther critics expressed more negative opinions of the game, with many citing frequent crashes and other technical issues, along with shallow gameplay.Kallie Plagge (IGN) said that although the game lacked in polish and depth, the overall experience made up for it.Matt Peckham (Time) criticized the game for its frequent crashes.Mike Cosimano (Destructoid) also took issue with the game, saying the original idea showed promise, but was improperly executed.Kat Brewster (The Guardian) wrote that although she thought Pokémon Go was not a good game, it was ""a great experience"".The server problems also received negative press.Miguel Concepcion (GameSpot) said that although he enjoyed the game\'s strong social appeal and visual design, the game\'s ""initial iteration is a buggy mess on all levels"", with one of the reasons being the constant server problems.Another glitch that appeared a few days after launch was the ""three-step glitch"", which made it impossible to ""hunt down a specific Pokémon"".Patricia Hernandez (Kotaku) said, ""the three step glitch adds to what has been a terrible launch for Pokémon Go"".Critics also emphasized on the large gap between the rural and urban players.Rural players seem to be at a major disadvantage when playing the game, while city players have access to more PokéStops and Gyms.\n\nPokémon Go rapidly rose the American iOS App Store\'s ""Top Grossing"" and ""Free"" charts.The game has become the fastest game to top the App Store and Google Play, beating Clash Royale, and it became the most downloaded app on the App Store of any app in their first week.Within two days of release, it was installed on more than 5% of Android devices in the United

McDonald\'s, Sprint, pay Niantic Labs for ""Foot Traffic"" on-demand of the retail shops.\n\nThe game was awarded five Guinness World Records in August 2016: most revenue grossed by a mobile game in its first month (); most downloaded mobile game in its first month (130 million downloads); most international charts topped simultaneously for a mobile game in its first month (top game in 70

installs and revenue is the United States, followed by Japan and Germany in revenue and by Brazil and Mexico in installs.\n\nDuring 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic causing restrictions on the ability of players to play Go outside their homes, Niantic implemented new features which allowed players to play the game from inside their homes, and this was credited with increasing its playerbase throughout the year despite the restrictions.Despite a brief drop early in the pandemic, the number of monthly active users of the game rose by 45 percent between January and August 2020, and the game\'s revenue in 2020 was the highest in its history, exceeding even its 2016 revenue.The game generated more than of revenue in the first 10 months of 2020 according to Sensor Tower, and it was the

million people engaged in 1.1 billion interactions that mentioned Pokémon Go on Facebook and Instagram in the month of July.Numerous media outlets referred to the surge in popularity as ""Pokémon Go Mania"", or simply ""Pokémania"".The massive popularity of the game resulted in several unusual positive effects.For example, the game placed players where they can help catch criminals and report crimes in progress, although it has also placed some in harm\'s way, and has even aided law enforcement\'s community relations, albeit with caveats.Businesses also benefited from the nearby presence of PokéStops (or them being PokéStops themselves) with the concomitant influx of people, and the intense exploration of communities has brought local history to the forefront.The game was also seen bringing its players to places of worship, as many Pokégyms are located there.Despite some criticism by religious leaders, this was received positively by religious groups, who saw it as reminding adherents to come and pray.Some establishments considered purchasing lures in the game to attract additional players to PokéStops on their property.Within a week of its release, a secondary market emerged for the game, both for the resell of high-level accounts on Craigslist and PlayerUp, and for the sale of expert advice on Thumbtack.Wireless provider T-Mobile US started an offer for free data for a year for Pokémon Go sessions, and Yelp added a filter that only shows businesses which have a PokéStop nearby.National parks across the United States saw an influx of visitors due to the game, with ""hundreds or thousands"" of people visiting the National Mall and Memorial Parks in Washington, D.C. on the weekend following Pokémon Go release in the country.Small museums with PokéStops placed at exhibits also reported increased attendance, such as the McNay Art Museum in San Antonio, Texas, and the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens in Boca Raton, Florida.Charity organizations also sought engagement from players, with animal shelters offering dog walks to people who want to hatch eggs.\n\nEduardo Paes, then-mayor of Rio de Janeiro, stated that he hoped the app would be released in Brazil before the start of the 2016 Summer Olympics in the city (and it was, on August 3), and United States presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton mentioned the app during their 2016 election campaigns.In late July 2016, during a public address, the President of Italy, Sergio Mattarella, compared a political issue about the date of an incoming referendum as preposterous as the hunt for the Pokémon.Shortly after the game\'s release, Bellator mixed martial artist Michael Page celebrated a knockout of his match opponent, Evangelista Santos by putting on a red Ash Ketchum-like hat and rolling a prop Poké Ball in Santos\'s direction.On July 25, Dwayne Johnson released a promo video featuring MatPat and Ali-A with himself as a tough, rare Pokémon.\n\nThe game was credited for popularizing AR, and was praised by genderfluid groups for letting the players choose a ""style"" instead of ""gender"".The game also had a positive impact among individuals with autism.The ""Pokémon Theme"" from the animated series saw a 630% increase in listeners on music streaming platform Spotify during the month of the game\'s release.Meanwhile, streaming services such as Hulu experienced an increased viewership of the Pokémon series and films.Nintendo reported that sales of the 3DS Pokémon games rose as a result of the game\'s popularity.A Twitch channel, Twitch Plays Pokémon Go, was created that mimics the crowd-played Twitch Plays Pokémon channel, allowing viewers to direct a virtual avatar in the game using an iPhone programmed to spoof its location.Niantic later issued permanent bans to those who cheated the game by means such as GPS spoofing and bots.Pokémon-themed pornography increased in popularity after the release of the game.xHamster, an adult video streaming website, reported that within 5 days of the game\'s release, Pokémon related terms were the most searched for videos.Another adult video streaming website, Pornhub, reported that

creates a distraction by ""flood[ing] the downstairs with Pokémon"", causing the people to run off with their cell phones.In the episode ""Looking for Mr. Goodbart"" from the 28th season of The Simpsons, the people of Springfield become addicted to Peekimon Get, a parody of Pokémon Go.\n\nGos release resulted in a resurgence in popularity for the Pokémon franchise as a whole.The Pokémon Sun and Moon games for the Nintendo 3DS, released later in 2016, was the best-selling video game for the 3DS with over 16 million copies sold, and this was partly attributed to the new fans to the series brought in by Go.In an interview, director of Sun and Moon Shigeru Ohmori remarked that the Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon sequels were designed partly to facilitate entry for newcomers to the franchise brought in by Go.The first Pokémon games for the Nintendo Switch, Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee!, took significant inspirations from Go.A line of official Go merchandise was released in November 2019.\n\nIn addition to standard gameplay, the game has held several in-game and live events.The first live event officially held by Niantic was held in Charlotte, North Carolina, in May 2017.In July 2017, a community event was held in Grant Park, Chicago, in honor of the first anniversary of the game\'s release.Despite the fact that almost no information about the event, including ticket prices and attractions, was released by Niantic ahead of the ticket sale, over 20,000 tickets sold out within a half hour.During the event itself, attendees suffered connectivity issues and crashes, due to the heavy amount of localized cellular activity.Afterwards, Niantic announced that they would refund everybody who bought a ticket, as well as give them $100 of in-game currency.Following the event, around two dozen attendees filed suit against Niantic, seeking travel reimbursement.\n\nFollowing the event in Chicago, other events have been held in Chester, Yokohama, and San Jose.In September 2017, a series of events named ""Safari Zone"" was held in Unibail-Rodamco shopping centers in Oberhausen, Paris and Barcelona, with events the following month in Copenhagen, Prague, Stockholm and Amstelveen.\n\nIn January 2018, Niantic announced monthly community event Community Day which aims to get players to meet up in their local areas.During a multi-hour period, players can encounter more frequent wild spawns of a particular Pokémon, an exclusive move for that Pokémon (or its evolution), an increased probability for the shiny form of that Pokémon, and bonuses such as extra stardust or XP.The Community Days in 2018 featured Pikachu (January 20), Dratini (February 24), Bulbasaur (March 25), Mareep (April 15), Charmander (May 19), Larvitar (June 16), Squirtle (July 8), Eevee (August 11–12), Chikorita (September 22), Beldum (October 21), and Cyndaquil (November 10).\n\nPokémon Go in Syria is a photography series published in 2016 by Syrian artist Khaled Akil.Akil places Pokémon characters in destroyed Syrian streets as a reminder for a world lost behind the screen.While Pokémon Go was trending worldwide, Akil couldn\'t help but notice how the media forgot about the war in Syria, and visualised his idea in the form of digital collages.Khaled\'s Pokémon series quickly went viral across the globe after he posted it online.This photography series was exhibited in various locations including the American University Museum.\n\nThe app was criticized for using locations such as cemeteries and memorials as sites to catch Pokémon, including the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, Arlington National Cemetery, the ANZAC War Memorial, and Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.Niantic later removed content from sensitive areas such as the Hiroshima Memorial and Holocaust Museum.The game sparked complaints from Dutch company ProRail, who said that players entered their railway tracks, and fire stations told players to not impede their staff by congregating outside.\n\nThe game\'s distribution of PokéStops and gyms (derived from the portals in Ingress, Niantic\'s science fiction-themed AR game) was noted to be sparser in many minority neighborhoods in a reflection of American demographics.Players in rural areas also complained about the lack of Pokémon spawns, PokéStops, and gyms in their area.Pokémon Go was criticized for game accessibility issues by players with physical disabilities.The AbleGamers Foundation COO, Steve Spohn, said that when Pokémon Go was compared to other mobile games, it ""excludes disabled players to a significant degree"".\n\nPolice departments in various countries issued warnings, some tongue-in-cheek, regarding inattentive driving, trespassing, and being targeted by criminals due to being unaware of one\'s surroundings.In the state of New York, sex offenders are banned from playing the app while on parole.Bosnian players were warned to stay out of minefields left over from the 1990s Bosnian War.In Russia, a 21-year-old video blogger, Ruslan Sokolovsky, was arrested in September 2016 for two months after playing Pokémon Go at the Church of All Saints in Yekaterinburg, and eventually received a suspended sentence for three and a half years in prison for charges of blasphemy.\n\nPeople have suffered various injuries from accidents related to the game.In Japan, the first accident occurred within hours of the game\'s release.The first death in Japan attributed to Pokémon Go occurred in late August 2016.A distracted driver playing the game killed one woman and seriously injured another.The 39-year-old farmer did not notice the women crossing a street and struck them with his truck.The woman died of a broken neck.Japan\'s National Police Agency said it was the 79th Pokémon Go-related accident in the country.On August 11, 2016, a young girl in Cambodia was reportedly killed after being hit by a car while trying to capture a Pokémon on a road.The case was the first death related to Pokémon Go among Southeast Asian countries.In January 2017, Chinese-American civilian Jiansheng Chen was shot dead while playing Pokémon Go.\n\nAl-Azhar University in Cairo described the game as ""harmful mania.""A Cossack leader declared that it ""smacks of Satanism"", Kuwait banned the game from government sites, Indonesian officials deemed it a national security threat, and in Israel the IDF banned the game from Army bases out of security considerations.In Saudi Arabia, the General Secretariat of the Council of Senior Scholars declared, in light of a 2001 fatwa banning the Pokémon card game as a form of gambling, that the electronic app required a new ruling.This was also followed by both Indian and Malaysian Islamic leaders telling Indian and Malaysian Muslims to avoid the game.\n\nDuring Thailand\'s 2016 constitutional referendum polling, Pokémon Go players were told to refrain from entering polling stations.Thus the Thai National Broadcasting and Communications Commission intends to ask Niantic to remove Pokémon characters and PokéStops from locations such as government facilities, historic and religious sites, private property as well as dangerous spots such as narrow footpaths and rivers.Cambodia has banned the game in a former genocide site after Pokémon players showed up at the site.Vietnam has banned players from entering the government and defense offices.The Vietnamese Ministry of Information and Communications is also considering the game\'s negative impact to Vietnamese society, where many people left home at night, crossed the road or drove on the street with their eyes kept focused on phones, which brought the need to ban the game in the country.Following the move by other Southeast Asian neighbors, the Philippines also banned the game in all administration offices.According to a survey by Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF), around 4% of employers in Malaysia fired their staff for playing the game during working hours.\n\nRussia also voiced their concerns over the application, with Nikolay Nikiforov, the country\'s Minister of Communications and Mass Media, suspecting foreign intelligence agencies using the application to collect information, while some fundamentalist religious groups in the region claim it to be demonic.The Supreme Council of Virtual Space in Iran officially banned the game in August 2016 over security concerns.The same month, The Pentagon facility in U.S. restricted the use of the game on their property, citing security risks by collecting secret information.In the United Kingdom, 290 police incidents were reported to have occurred in July 2016 in the country due to the game.In September 2016, Niantic stopped supporting the CyanogenMod mobile operating system.This prevented users playing on CyanogenMod from playing the game from that point forward.\n\nIn India, the Gujarat High Court issued a notice to Niantic, the developer of the popular AR-based game, on the grounds of ""posing danger to public safety"".The notice was issued on a PIL (Public Interest Litigation) seeking a ban on the location-based AR reality game in India.In addition, a second PIL was filed against the developers of Pokémon Go for hurting religious sentiments by showing images of eggs in places of worship of different religious groups.But the Indian Government refused to ban the game.\n\nPokémon Gos targeted local advertising has been described by Shoshana Zuboff in The Age of Surveillance Capitalism as an experiment that initiated from Google to move targeted advertising from the digital domain (cost per click) into the physical domain (cost per visit) by the use of sponsored locations.""In the end we recognize that the probe was designed to explore the next frontier: the means of behavioral modification.The game about the game is, in fact, an experimental facsimile of surveillance capitalism\'s design for our future.""\n\nMultiple unofficial, third-party apps were created to correspond with Pokémon Go.Notable apps include ""Poké Radar"" and ""Helper for Pokémon Go"", where players can crowdsource much of the Pokémon that can be found in the game at a particular time.At its peak of popularity, ""Poké Radar"" hit #2 on the Apple App Store, behind Pokémon Go itself.\n\nAnother app, GoChat, which allows players to leave messages for other players at specific locations, accrued more than 1 million downloads in five days and reached the top 10 in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.However, the app\'s developer Jonathan Zarra chose to leave the app unmonetized and had financial trouble keeping the app\'s servers online until bringing on angel investor and board member Michael Robertson.After acquiring significant funding, the app reached over 2 million active users.According to RiskIQ, at least 215 fake versions of the game were available by July 17, 2016.Several of these fake apps contained malicious programming and viruses.\n\nLaunched on July 22, 2016, ""Pokévision"" enabled players to find exactly where Pokémon spawned and how much time was left until they despawned; the site used data hacked directly from the game.In the five days following the website\'s launch, 27 million unique visitors used the site.On July 31, multiple search apps and sites, including Pokévision, were disabled as they violated Niantic\'s terms of service.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Niantic responded by implementing changes and new features in the game which allowed players to easily play remotely.However, starting on August 1, 2021, Niantic began rolling back these changes as part of their Exploration Bonus Updates.Players in New Zealand and the United States were the first to receive the post-pandemic changes, and gradually, they were rolled out to the rest of the world ""in accordance with recommendations from global health organizations.""In fear of violations in health and personal safety regulations, as well as negatively impacting players with disabilities, the company has since received heavy criticism from the player base (including top players Brandon Tan and Nick Oyzon) due to their reverting safety measures implemented during the pandemic, in which gym and Pokéstop interaction distances were increased from 40 to 80 metres.Despite increasing rates of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in various U.S. states (resulting in overflowing hospitals), Niantic are firm on not keeping the pandemic bonuses.Players began boycotting Pokémon Go since in first week of August 2021.\n\nOn Twitter, the #HearUsNiantic started trending worldwide as fans and players voiced their censure towards Niantic\'s decision to remove the pandemic bonuses.A letter was sent to Niantic, which responded to the community by stating that the pandemic changes will not stay.As Niantic are an AR company, part of their business strategy is to sell user data by players after completing AR Mapping tasks where they can log their surroundings at marked PokéStops in their in-game maps.The reduced distance means an increased potential for Niantic to generate more revenue.Another reason for their changes is for Niantic to preserve their image of being an AR tech giant; on their blog post they stated that it is their ""mission"" to ""encourage outdoor exploration"" and ""to connect [people] to real places in the real world, and to visit places that are worth exploring.""Players have also speculated that Niantic is rolling back the pandemic bonuses to send players closer to sponsored businesses such as McDonald\'s (marked by a PokéStop or gym), from which Niantic has made a lot of money.\n\nList of

56,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Pokémon Go', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'Pokémon Go (stylized as Pokémon GO) is a 2016 augmented reality (AR) mobile game, part of the Pokémon franchise, developed and published by Niantic in collaboration with Nintendo and The Pokémon Company for iOS and Android devices.It uses mobile devices with GPS to locate, capture, train, and battle virtual Pokémon, which appear as if they are in the player\'s real-world location.The game is free-to-play; it uses a freemium business model combined with local advertising and supports in-app purchases for additional in-game items.The game launched with around 150 species of Pokémon, which had increased to around 700 by 2021.\n\nPokémon Go was released to mixed reviews; critics praised the concept but criticized technical problems.It was one of the most used and profitable mobile apps in 2016, having been downloaded more than 500 million times worldwide by the end of the year.It is credited with popularizing location-based and AR technology, promoting physical activity, and helping local businesses grow due to escalated foot traffic.However, it attracted controversy for contributing to accidents and creating public nuisances.Various governments expressed concerns about security, and some countries regulate its use.The game had over monthly active users by May 2018, over a billion global downloads by early 2019, and grossed more than in revenue by 2020.\n\nAfter establishing a game account, players create and customize their own avatars.Once created, an avatar is displayed on a map based on the player\'s geographical location.Features on the map include \'PokéStops\' and \'Pokémon Gyms\'.These PokéStops can be equipped with items called \'Lure Modules\', which attract additional wild, and occasionally rare, Pokémon.Gyms serve as battle locations for team-based king of the hill matches.PokéStops and Gyms are typically located at places of interest.These locations were initially re-purposed portals from Ingress, Niantic\'s previous augmented reality (AR) game.This has led to PokéStops and Pokémon Gyms being placed at dangerous or inconvenient locations, such as a now-deleted Gym at the Korean Demilitarized Zone and Bagram Airforce Base, which was abandoned by U.S. forces in July 2021.Since 2019, these locations also include submissions from Go players which are largely reviewed by other players.\n\nAs players move within their real world surroundings, their avatars move within the game\'s map.Different Pokémon species reside in different areas of the world; for example, Water-type Pokémon are generally found near water.When a player encounters a Pokémon, it may be viewed either in AR mode or with a live rendered, generic background.AR mode uses the camera and gyroscope on the player\'s mobile device to display an image of a Pokémon as though it were in the real world.Players can take screenshots of the Pokémon they encounter either with or without the AR mode activated.\n\nAlthough the game is free to play, it supports in-app purchases, where players can purchase additional Poké Balls and other in-game items.These items include Incense, which attracts Pokémon to the player as they move for sixty minutes, Lure Modules, which players use at PokéStops to attract Pokémon to their current location near the PokeStop, and Lucky Eggs, which double experience points gained for a thirty-minute period from use.All Pokémon are displayed with a Combat Power, which is a rough measure of how powerful that Pokémon is in battle.Generally, as players level up, they catch Pokémon with higher CP and Pokémon are somewhat harder to catch.The player can check how strong their Pokémon are by the ""Appraisal"" system.\n\nPlayers can customize their avatar\'s appearance with clothing options that differ in availability according to season, player level, and game sponsors.Clothing includes: hats, accessories, tops, bottoms, socks, footwear and bags.Most clothing aligns with either the look of a specific Pokémon, a specific team and/or Pokémon region.Many pieces of clothing are free, but pieces can also be purchased using coins, earned during select events, awarded as the player levels up, or received as a prize for special research completion.\n\nAnother way for a player to customize their avatar is with a pose.Poses, like clothing, are free, purchased, or awarded.Certain poses are event based and can only be earned during the event they are attached to.Once the event is over, there is no guarantee that the pose will be available in-game again.\n\nIn April 2024, Pokémon GO was updated to allow greater customization of player avatars.Customization now includes a limited number of different hair styles, the ability to adjust the weight of the avatar, and expanded options for skin color.This update was met with mass backlash from the playerbase, as the new avatars were perceived to be of inferior graphical quality in comparison to the outgoing models, and because the updated models interfered with some pre-update cosmetic items, of which many had been purchased by players.\n\nUnlike most other installments in the Pokémon series, players in Pokémon Go do not battle wild Pokémon to catch them.During an encounter with a wild Pokémon, a player may throw a Poké Ball at it by flicking it from the bottom of the screen up toward the Pokémon.If the Pokémon is caught, it will come under the ownership of the player.Factors in the success rate of catching a Pokémon include the Pokémon\'s catch rate, the timing, the type of Poké Ball used, etc.After catching a wild Pokémon, the player is awarded two types of in-game currencies: Candies and Stardust.The Candies awarded by a successful catch depend on what evolutionary chain a Pokémon belongs to.A player can use Stardust and Candies to raise a Pokémon\'s level and hence ""Combat Power"" (CP).However, only Candies are needed to evolve a Pokémon, except for certain Pokémon that might need special items.Each Pokémon evolution tree has its own type of Candy, which can only be used to evolve or level up.The maximum level a player can achieve was originally level 40, but expanded to 50 as of November 30, 2020.The player can also transfer the Pokémon back to the Pokémon Professor Willow to earn more Candies and create room for more Pokémon.Shiny Pokémon are available through multiple ways, mostly by chance.One popular goal of the game is to complete the entries in the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon logbook, by catching and evolving them to collect every one in it.\n\nIn September 2016, Niantic introduced a ""Buddy Pokémon"" feature, which allows players to pick a Pokémon to appear alongside them on the profile screen, and receive in-game rewards and bonuses based on the chosen Pokémon.The feature was released later that month.Certain Pokémon have different distances that they need to be walked in order to receive candy.The more the player walks in real time, the more candy they can earn.During the same update, Niantic made it impossible for players with rooted or jailbroken devices to log into the game in an effort to reduce and prevent cheating.\n\nOn January 20, 2018, Pokémon Go held the first Community Day, a monthly event that increases the appearance rate of a specific Pokémon and offer an exclusive move to the final evolution of the featured Pokémon only if caught or evolved during the event window.Players also have a higher chance to catch the Shiny variant of the featured Pokémon.The first Community Day featured Pikachu, with the exclusive move Surf to Raichu.\n\nThe game is regularly updated with new Pokémon, and as of March 25, 2022, there are just over 730 Pokémon in the game (not including regional varieties) out of a total 1008.\n\nRegional Pokémon are often released together, such as Hoenn region Pokémon released in December 2017, Alolan variants in May 2018, Sinnoh region Pokémon(along with the Sinnoh Stone item used to evolve them) released in October 2018, Unova region Pokémon (and the Unova Stone) in September 2019, Kalos region Pokémon in December 2020, and again more Alola region Pokémon in March 2022.\n\nMythical and legendary Pokémon are often released individually (or in pairs/trios) in special events or quests.The first Legendary Pokémon released was Groudon, in December 2017.The Mythical Pokémon Meltan and its evolved form, Melmetal are so far the only Pokémon to have made their debut on Pokémon Go.Their release coincided with the release of Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee!on the Nintendo Switch, Pokémon Go introduced the new Mythical Pokémon Meltan originally as a teaser, later to be available to capture only in Pokémon Go via a ""Mystery Box"" item that could be obtained through transferring Pokémon from Pokémon Go to either Nintendo Switch Pokémon games, or by completing new Research Tasks.\n\nIn August 2020, Mega Evolution came to Pokémon Go with four Pokémon able to Mega Evolve into five forms.\n\nPlayers earn experience points for various in-game activities.Players rise in level as they earn experience points (XP), with various features being progressively unlocked.Most-notably, at level five, the player can battle at a Pokémon Gym and join one of three color-coded teams (red for Team Valor, blue for Team Mystic, or yellow for Team Instinct), which act as factions battling for control of Gyms within the Pokémon Go world.\n\nIn June 2017, Niantic announced that the game mechanics of Gyms would be revamped for a more teamwork-oriented experience; Gyms were disabled on June 19, 2017, with the new Gyms being released with the next app update a few days later.As of the update, Gyms included a spinnable component to receive in-game items such as Potions and Poké Balls.Additionally, Gyms are capped at containing six Pokémon, each of which must be unique in that Gym.Coins are now earned based on the amount of time the defending Pokémon has been in a Gym, as opposed to a one-per-day gym defender bonus of 10 coins per current defending Pokémon.Legendary, Mythical and Buddy Pokémon cannot be placed in Gyms.\n\nIn July 2017, Raid Battles were introduced.Raid Battles consist of a group of players gathering to confront an over-leveled Pokémon located in a Gym.If the Pokémon is defeated, the players gain the chance to catch a regular version of it.Raid difficulties range from 1 to 5, with 1 being of the lowest difficulty, and 5 being the most difficult to defeat.Level 5 raids are exclusive to Legendary Pokémon.The first of these, Articuno and Lugia, were released on July 22, 2017, after the Go Fest, with Moltres and Zapdos following.From September to November, the 3 Legendary Beasts: Entei, Raikou and Suicune, were released shortly after, rotating regions every month.Following their departure, the Legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh appeared in Raid Battles from November 27, 2017, to December 12, 2017.In August 2020, level 3 Mega raids arrived with the introduction of Mega Evolution.At the same time, Level 2 and 4 raids were combined into Level 1 and 3 raids.\n\nIn May 2022, Raid Battle were updated to include the addition of Mega Legendary Pokémon, which were turned to 6 stars, the highest currently in the game.The only Pokémon included in these Raids were Mega Latios and Mega Latias.\n\nIn October 2022, a new form of raid battle called ""Elite Raids"" were introduced.Elite Raids differ to normal raids in a number of ways, most notably that they can only be battled in person, take 24 hours to start, and are extremely difficult, often requiring a large number of players to defeat the Pokémon.\n\nIn May 2023, another new form of raid battles were introduced called ""Shadow Raids"".Shadow Raids may only be battled in person and award the chance to catch a Shadow Pokémon upon defeat.During the battle, the Pokémon may become ""enraged"", increasing both attack and defence, but can be returned to normal using a ""Purified Gem"".\n\nIn December 2018, Niantic added player vs player Trainer Battles.In January 2020, Niantic rolled out an online battle format Go Battle League which allows players to fight other players worldwide.Unlike the Trainer Battles format introduced in 2018, Go Battle League does not require physical proximity, scanning QR code on each other\'s phone, knowing each other\'s friend code, or any other real-world interactions between players.Instead, participating players are automatically paired by the game server via some variant of the Elo rating system.\n\nIn July 2019, Pokémon Go introduced Team GO Rocket battles.Team GO Rocket NPCs could be battled at PokéStops indicated with it twitching and being a dark color or in Team GO Rocket Balloons which follow the player on the map.After victory, the player has the opportunity to capture a ""Shadow Pokémon"" which are relatively low-leveled, angry-looking Pokémon.Shadow Pokémon have a higher attack stat but a lower defense stat than a normal Pokémon.After capture, the player can choose to purify the Shadow Pokémon.Purified Pokémon are higher-leveled than their Shadow counterparts, can learn an exclusive move when purified, and need fewer candies to evolve.\n\nThe concept for the game was conceived in 2014 by Satoru Iwata of Nintendo and Tsunekazu Ishihara of The Pokémon Company as an April Fools\' Day collaboration with Google, called the Google Maps: Pokémon Challenge.Ishihara was a fan of developer Niantic\'s previous transreality game, Ingress, and saw the game\'s concept as a perfect match for the Pokémon series.Niantic, a subsidiary of Google, used the crowdsourced data from Ingress to populate the locations for PokéStops and gyms within Pokémon Go, data from Google Maps to spawn specific Pokémon on certain terrain, and map display from OpenStreetMap since December 2017.The game\'s application logic uses the open source Kubernetes system - and due to the game\'s sheer scale of users, a number of bugs with the Kubernetes system was discovered and later fixed.Niantic was spun off from Google as an independent company in 2015 following the company reorganization into Alphabet Inc.\n\nIn 2015, Ishihara dedicated his speech at the game\'s announcement on September 10 to Iwata, who had died two months earlier.Tatsuo Nomura, who joined Niantic in 2015 after he developed the Google Maps Pokémon Challenge, acted as Director and Product Manager for the game.The game\'s soundtrack was written by longtime Pokémon series composer, Junichi Masuda, who also assisted with some of the game\'s design.Among the game\'s graphic designers was Dennis Hwang, who previously created the logo of Gmail while working for Google.\n\nOn March 4, 2016, Niantic announced a Japan-exclusive beta test would begin later that month, allowing players to assist in refining the game before its full release.The beta test was later expanded to other countries.On April 7, it was announced that the beta would expand to Australia and New Zealand.Then, on May 16, the signups for the field test were opened to the United States.The test came to an end on June 30.\n\nAt the Comic-Con 2016, John Hanke, founder of Niantic, revealed the appearances of the three team leaders: Candela (Team Valor), Blanche (Team Mystic), and Spark (Team Instinct).Hanke conveyed that approximately 10% of the ideas for the game were implemented.Future updates, including the addition of trading, more Pokémon, implementation of Pokémon Centers at PokéStops, a patch for the ""three step glitch"", and easier training, were also confirmed.He also stated that Niantic would be continuing support for the game for ""years to come"".In an interview with TechCrunch in September 2016, Hanke hinted that player vs. player Pokémon battles would be released in a future update.In December 2016, coffeehouse chain Starbucks and telecommunications company Sprint collaborated with Nintendo to add PokéStops and gyms at certain locations of theirs throughout the United States.That same month, a companion app for Apple Watch devices was released, which allows users to receive notifications about nearby Pokémon, but does not allow for them to be caught.In January 2017, an additional 5,000 more Starbucks locations became available as gyms.In February 2017, an update was released which introduced over 100 species based in the Johto region from the second generation of the core Pokémon series, which were added alongside the original 151.The update also included the addition of new berries, new Pokémon encounter mechanics, and an expanded selection of avatar clothing options.Some of the Pokémon introduced in Ruby and Sapphire were added in late 2017, starting with a Halloween event in October and 50 more in December.A weather system was added alongside the latter, allowing real-world weather to affect gameplay.In November 2018, a game developed by Game Freak and heavily inspired by Pokémon Go, Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee! was released on the Nintendo Switch.This game will feature Pokémon Go style catching with Joy-Con and there has integration between the two games.In addition, new Pokémon Meltan was revealed in September, becoming the first new Pokémon to be released through Pokémon Go.On October 10, 2018, The Pokémon Company and Niantic announced plans to introduce Pokémon from Diamond and Pearl into Pokémon Go.On October 12, Niantic teased one of the Generation IV Pokémon that would be coming to Pokémon Go.On October 25, a feature known as Adventure Sync was announced, which will record the player\'s walking data in the background.On October 26, Niantic announced research tasks for Bug type Pokémon that will give players a chance to catch Shedinja throughout November.\n\nAccording to John Hanke in a January 2019 interview with Business Insider, 2018 saw Go become the game initially envisioned by Niantic.\n\nIn 2020, Niantic made major changes to gameplay mechanisms to account for the COVID-19 pandemic which saw many players unable to leave their homes to play.These development shift saw changes like the addition of indoor step tracking to count toward in-game distance challenges, long distance PVP battles, increased ""incense"" effectiveness, increased spawn points, and a doubled player radius.\n\nThe Pokémon Go Plus is a Bluetooth Low Energy wearable device, developed by Nintendo\'s Platform Technology Development division, that allows players to perform certain actions in the game without looking at their smart device.When a player is near a Pokémon or PokéStop, the Plus vibrates.The player can then press the button to capture the Pokémon or receive items from the PokéStop; the player cannot check what they have received until the next time they sign into the app onto their mobile device.The design consists of a Poké Ball and the shape of the Google Maps pin.The decision to create the device rather than create a smartwatch app was to increase uptake among players for whom a smartwatch is prohibitively expensive.It was released in the United Kingdom and North America on September 16, 2016.\n\nThe game\'s official launch began on July 6, 2016, with releases in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.Due to server strain from high demand upon release, Niantic CEO John Hanke stated that the release in other regions was to be ""paused until Niantic was comfortable"" fixing the issues.European releases started on July 13, and the game became available to most of the continent over the following ten days.The Japanese launch was initially reported to be on July 20; however, the game was delayed after a sponsorship deal with fast food chain McDonald\'s was leaked, instead releasing two days later.Although the game was proposed to be released in France on July 15, it was postponed until July 24 out of respect and due to safety concerns following a terrorist attack in Nice on July 14.Following the shut down of third-party apps and websites in late-July 2016—significantly reducing server strain—Niantic was able to continue pushing release worldwide.Central and South America and most of Southeast Asia subsequently saw releases in early August.Indonesia was the first Asian country to have the game playable, despite the game not being officially released in that region until August 6.\n\nIn South Korea, the game was not officially released as major restrictions on the use of online mapping data exist.However, due to a glitch, a small area around Sokcho in the northeastern part of the country was considered a part of Niantic\'s North Korea mapping region, making the game fully playable in that area.Numerous people took advantage of the gap to play the game.Bus tickets from the capital city of Seoul sold out and people living within Sokcho shared information on free Wi-Fi areas to tourists.Players also discovered a gym in Panmunjom, along the Korean Demilitarized Zone; however, Niantic later removed it from the game.Following the release of Pokémon Go in Japan, parts of Busan also became playable as parts of the city are considered part of Japan\'s mapping area due to the proximity of Tsushima Island.The game officially released in the country in January 2017.\n\nIn mainland China, Google services are banned by the Great Firewall, whereas the GPS function in the game is blocked by Niantic.Players of Pokémon Go in China have to download the game with App Store IDs from other regions and use VPN to access Google services in order to load the game, and some even use a GPS spoofing app to bypass the GPS blocking.Some players also downloaded a clone app called City Spirit Go, which was released shortly after Pokémon Go beta test in Japan.As of 2020, the official game is still unplayable in most parts of China with GPS modules being blocked in-game.\n\nDuring its launch in Southeast Asia in August 2016, the game officially excluded Myanmar, but users in Thailand discovered that the game was fully playable in border cities near the nation.The game was released in the Balkans, Macau, and Central Asia in September 2016, and was also released throughout Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia by the end of the year.\n\nOn September 11, 2018, the game appeared in Russia\'s App Store and Google Play Store over two years after the first launch.However, Niantic did not officially announce the release.\n\nIn May 2019, the game was released on the Samsung Galaxy Store.\n\nInvestors were buoyed by the response to the initial release of Pokémon Go on July 7, with Nintendo\'s share price rising by an initial 10% and by July 14 shares rose to as high as 50%.Despite Nintendo only owning a 32% stake in The Pokémon Company and an undisclosed stake in Niantic, Nintendo\'s market value increased by US$9 billion within five days of release of Pokémon Go.The trend continued for more than a week after the game\'s release and by July 19, the stock value of Nintendo more than doubled as compared to pre-release.Turnover sales reached a record-breaking ¥703.6 billion (US$6.6 billion); and trading of the stock accounted for a quarter of all trades on the Tokyo Stock Exchange\'s main board.The Financial Times believed that investors were speculating not on Pokémon Go as such, but on future Nintendo app releases being as successful as the company moves more into the mobile app market—an area they were historically reluctant to enter in the belief it would cannibalise its portable console and video game sales.Nintendo plans to release four more smartphone app games by March 2017, and investors remarked that Pokémon Go showed Nintendo still has some of the ""most valuable character intellectual property in the world"" with franchises such as Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid.\n\nBy July 22, Nintendo gained ¥1.8 trillion ($17.6 billion) in market capitalization since the game\'s launch.However, following clarification from Nintendo that the company did not produce Pokémon Go nor had tangible financial gains from it, its stock fell by 18%—equating to a ¥708 billion ($6.7 billion) loss in market value—on July 25.This was the largest single-day decline for Nintendo since 1990 and the maximum one-day exchange of finances allowed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.The company has an approximate 13% ""effective economic stake"" in the game, according to Macquarie Securities.\n\nThe surge in stocks extended beyond Nintendo, with Tomy, TV Tokyo, and the Bank of Kyoto, among other companies, all seeing significant gains.Similarly, Zagg, which owns a company that manufactures battery cases, saw a 25% rise in its stock in relation to Pokémon Go.\n\nAt launch, the game suffered from frequent server outages due to extreme usage.The global server usage expectation for the game was surpassed within 15 minutes of the game\'s release in Australia and New Zealand, and peaked at 50 times expected traffic, or 10 times the expected worst-case scenario.Frequent crashes and authentication errors plagued the game\'s release and persisted for several days.For the first two days after launch, players were unable to access the game through their Pokémon Trainer Club accounts; only Gmail-based accounts were able to gain access to the game.Servers again suffered frequent outages in Australia on July 11; players blamed people in the United Kingdom for bypassing local servers and using Australian ones to play the game before its official release.On July 16, a few hours after the release in many European countries, the game\'s servers temporarily went down.The outage was claimed by a hacking group called ""PoodleCorp"", who said they used a DDoS attack to take them down, although the problem was fixed later that day.The next day, the servers went down again as the game was launched in Canada.John Hanke issued an apology for the server issues at San Diego Comic Con 2016, stating ""we weren\'t provisioned for what happened"".\n\nSome early iOS installs of Pokémon Go required users to provide the app with full access to their Google accounts, thereby allowing the app to ""access players\' Gmail-based email, Google Drive-based files, photos and videos stored in Google Photos, and any other content within their Google accounts"".The Pokémon Company and Niantic responded to the concerns, recognizing that the iOS app, at the time, ""... erroneously requests full access permission for the user\'s Google account ...""However, Adam Reeve—the person who initially made claims of the security issues in a Tumblr post—later backtracked on his claim and was not ""100 percent sure"" it was valid.Dan Guido, CEO of the security company Trail of Bits, analyzed the app\'s programming and discovered that although the game did request full account access, this did not enable third-party usage as initially conveyed.Guido found that this did enable Niantic to access people\'s email addresses and phone numbers unintentionally.A subsequent iOS app update reduced the scope of access.Niantic also issued a statement assuring users that no information was collected nor was any information beyond what was necessary to use the app accessed.\n\nAlongside server issues, Pokémon Go suffered from several glitches.One of the more prominent bugs appeared in mid-July 2016 and rendered the game\'s tracking feature useless.Normally, this feature shows between zero and three footprints to inform the player of how close they are to a nearby Pokémon; however, it universally became ""stuck"" at three steps, earning it the name ""three-step-glitch"".Niantic removed the footstep feature altogether on July 30, sparking criticism from players.By August 1, players reported a new glitch that swaps their captured Pokémon with another creature at random.Another bug, confirmed by Niantic in August, inadvertently made capturing Pokémon more difficult.Some legendary Pokémon, which are rare and powerful versions of the creatures, were also obtained by players in a glitch, though they were later removed from the accounts of the trainers to keep the game fair.\n\nPokémon Go released to ""mixed or average"" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.Upon release, critics called the experience enjoyable, but noted the game\'s technical issues.\n\nCritics praised various aspects of Pokémon Go.Oscar Dayus (Pocket Gamer) said that the game was an immensely enjoyable experience and continued with how ""the very personal nature of catching Pokémon in your own neighborhood made me smile more than any game has for years"".Jeremy Parish (US Gamer) compared the game and its social aspects to a massively multiplayer online game.Reviewers also praised the game enabling the promotion of physical exercise.Terri Schwartz (IGN) said it was ""secretly the best exercise app out there"" and that it changed her daily walking routine.Patrick Allen (Lifehacker) wrote an article with tips about how to work out using Pokémon Go.Julia Belluz (Vox) said it could be the ""greatest unintentional health fad ever"" and wrote that one of the results of the game that the developers may not have realized was that ""it seems to be getting people moving"".Users took an extra 194 steps per day once they started using the app, which approximated to 26% more than usual.IGN named it the 100th best video game of all time in 2018.\n\nPhilip Kollar and Allegra Frank (Polygon) both agreed that Pokémon Go was ""an exciting social experience"", but were not sure how long the game and its popularity would last, stating it could either last for coming years or ""end up as a brush fire craze that the whole gaming world is talking about for a few weeks and then is forgotten"".\n\nOther critics expressed more negative opinions of the game, with many citing frequent crashes and other technical issues, along with shallow gameplay.Kallie Plagge (IGN) said that although the game lacked in polish and depth, the overall experience made up for it.Matt Peckham (Time) criticized the game for its frequent crashes.Mike Cosimano (Destructoid) also took issue with the game, saying the original idea showed promise, but was improperly executed.Kat Brewster (The Guardian) wrote that although she thought Pokémon Go was not a good game, it was ""a great experience"".The server problems also received negative press.Miguel Concepcion (GameSpot) said that although he enjoyed the game\'s strong social appeal and visual design, the game\'s ""initial iteration is a buggy mess on all levels"", with one of the reasons being the constant server problems.Another glitch that appeared a few days after launch was the ""three-step glitch"", which made it impossible to ""hunt down a specific Pokémon"".Patricia Hernandez (Kotaku) said, ""the three step glitch adds to what has been a terrible launch for Pokémon Go"".Critics also emphasized on the large gap between the rural and urban players.Rural players seem to be at a major disadvantage when playing the game, while city players have access to more PokéStops and Gyms.\n\nPokémon Go rapidly rose the American iOS App Store\'s ""Top Grossing"" and ""Free"" charts.The game has become the fastest game to top the App Store and Google Play, beating

installs and revenue is the United States, followed by Japan and Germany in revenue and by Brazil and Mexico in installs.\n\nDuring 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic causing restrictions on the ability of players to play Go outside their homes, Niantic implemented new features which allowed players to play the game from inside their homes, and this was credited with increasing its playerbase throughout the year despite the restrictions.Despite a brief drop early in the pandemic, the number of monthly active users of the game rose by 45 percent between January and August 2020, and the game\'s revenue in 2020 was the highest in its history, exceeding even its 2016 revenue.The game generated more than of revenue in the first 10 months of 2020 according to Sensor Tower, and it was the

revenue to by 2020.The game generated a further in the first half of 2021.\n\nThe game was referred to as a ""social media phenomenon"" which has brought people together from all walks of life.231 million people engaged in 1.1 billion interactions that mentioned Pokémon Go on Facebook and Instagram in the month of July.Numerous media outlets referred to the surge in popularity as ""Pokémon Go Mania"", or simply ""Pokémania"".The massive popularity of the game resulted in several unusual positive effects.For example, the game placed players where they can help catch criminals and report crimes in progress, although it has also placed some in harm\'s way, and has even aided law enforcement\'s community relations, albeit with caveats.Businesses also benefited from the nearby presence of PokéStops (or them being PokéStops themselves) with the concomitant influx of people, and the intense exploration of communities has brought local history to the forefront.The game was also seen bringing its players to places of worship, as many Pokégyms are located there.Despite some criticism by religious leaders, this was received positively by religious groups, who saw it as reminding adherents to come and pray.Some establishments considered purchasing lures in the game to attract additional players to PokéStops on their property.Within a week of its release, a secondary market emerged for the game, both for the resell of high-level accounts on Craigslist and PlayerUp, and for the sale of expert advice on Thumbtack.Wireless provider T-Mobile US started an offer for free data for a year for Pokémon Go sessions, and Yelp added a filter that only shows businesses which have a PokéStop nearby.National parks across the United States saw an influx of visitors due to the game, with ""hundreds or thousands"" of people visiting the National Mall and Memorial Parks in Washington, D.C. on the weekend following Pokémon Go release in the country.Small museums with PokéStops placed at exhibits also reported increased attendance, such as the McNay Art Museum in San Antonio, Texas, and the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens in Boca Raton, Florida.Charity organizations also sought engagement from players, with animal shelters offering dog walks to people who want to hatch eggs.\n\nEduardo Paes, then-mayor of Rio de Janeiro, stated that he hoped the app would be released in Brazil before the start of the 2016 Summer Olympics in the city (and it was, on August 3), and United States presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton mentioned the app during their 2016 election campaigns.In late July 2016, during a public address, the President of Italy, Sergio Mattarella, compared a political issue about the date of an incoming referendum as preposterous as the hunt for the Pokémon.Shortly after the game\'s release, Bellator mixed martial artist Michael Page celebrated a knockout of his match opponent, Evangelista Santos by putting on a red Ash Ketchum-like hat and rolling a prop Poké Ball in Santos\'s direction.On July 25, Dwayne Johnson released a promo video featuring MatPat and Ali-A with himself as a tough, rare Pokémon.\n\nThe game was credited for popularizing AR, and was praised by genderfluid groups for letting the players choose a ""style"" instead of ""gender"".The game also had a positive impact among individuals with autism.The ""Pokémon Theme"" from the animated series saw a 630% increase in listeners on music streaming platform Spotify during the month of the game\'s release.Meanwhile, streaming services such as Hulu experienced an increased viewership of the Pokémon series and films.Nintendo reported that sales of the 3DS Pokémon games rose as a result of the game\'s popularity.A Twitch channel, Twitch Plays Pokémon Go, was created that mimics the crowd-played Twitch Plays Pokémon channel, allowing viewers to direct a virtual avatar in the game using an iPhone programmed to spoof its location.Niantic later issued permanent bans to those who cheated the game by means such as GPS spoofing and bots.Pokémon-themed pornography increased in popularity after the release of the game.xHamster, an adult video streaming website, reported that within 5 days of the game\'s release, Pokémon related terms were the most searched for videos.Another adult video streaming website, Pornhub, reported that Pokémon related searches spiked 136%.Pokémon Go was spoofed in the Maroon 5 music video, ""Don\'t Wanna Know"".In the 2016 Doctor Who Christmas special, ""The Return of Doctor Mysterio"", the Doctor creates a distraction by ""flood[ing] the downstairs with Pokémon"", causing the people to run off with their cell phones.In the episode ""Looking for Mr. Goodbart"" from the 28th season of The Simpsons, the people of Springfield become addicted to Peekimon Get, a parody of Pokémon Go.\n\nGos release resulted in a resurgence in popularity for the Pokémon franchise as a whole.The Pokémon Sun and Moon games for the Nintendo 3DS, released later in 2016, was the best-selling video game for the 3DS with over 16 million copies sold, and this was partly attributed to the new fans to the series brought in by Go.In an interview, director of Sun and Moon Shigeru Ohmori remarked that the Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon sequels were designed partly to facilitate entry for newcomers to the franchise brought in by Go.The first Pokémon games for the Nintendo Switch, Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee!, took significant inspirations from Go.A line of official Go merchandise was released in November 2019.\n\nIn addition to standard gameplay, the game has held several in-game and live events.The first live event officially held by Niantic was held in Charlotte, North Carolina, in May 2017.In July 2017, a community event was held in Grant Park, Chicago, in honor of the first anniversary of the game\'s release.Despite the fact that almost no information about the event, including ticket prices and attractions, was released by Niantic ahead of the ticket sale, over 20,000 tickets sold out within a half hour.During the event itself, attendees suffered connectivity issues and crashes, due to the heavy amount of localized cellular activity.Afterwards, Niantic announced that they would refund everybody who bought a ticket, as well as give them $100 of in-game currency.Following the event, around two dozen attendees filed suit against Niantic, seeking travel reimbursement.\n\nFollowing the event in Chicago, other events have been held in Chester, Yokohama, and San Jose.In September 2017, a series of events named ""Safari Zone"" was held in Unibail-Rodamco shopping centers in Oberhausen, Paris and Barcelona, with events the following month in Copenhagen, Prague, Stockholm and Amstelveen.\n\nIn January 2018, Niantic announced monthly community event Community Day which aims to get players to meet up in their local areas.During a multi-hour period, players can encounter more frequent wild spawns of a particular Pokémon, an exclusive move for that Pokémon (or its evolution), an increased probability for the shiny form of that Pokémon, and bonuses such as extra stardust or XP.The Community Days in 2018 featured Pikachu (January 20), Dratini (February 24), Bulbasaur (March 25), Mareep (April 15), Charmander (May 19), Larvitar (June 16), Squirtle (July 8), Eevee (August 11–12), Chikorita (September 22), Beldum (October 21), and Cyndaquil (November 10).\n\nPokémon Go in Syria is a photography series published in 2016 by Syrian artist Khaled Akil.Akil places Pokémon characters in destroyed Syrian streets as a reminder for a world lost behind the screen.While Pokémon Go was trending worldwide, Akil couldn\'t help but notice how the media forgot about the war in Syria, and visualised his idea in the form of digital collages.Khaled\'s Pokémon series quickly went viral across the globe after he posted it online.This photography series was exhibited in various locations including the American University Museum.\n\nThe app was criticized for using locations such as cemeteries and memorials as sites to catch Pokémon, including the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, Arlington National Cemetery, the ANZAC War Memorial, and Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.Niantic later removed content from sensitive areas such as the Hiroshima Memorial and Holocaust Museum.The game sparked complaints from Dutch company ProRail, who said that players entered their railway tracks, and fire stations told players to not impede their staff by congregating outside.\n\nThe game\'s distribution of PokéStops and gyms (derived from the portals in Ingress, Niantic\'s science fiction-themed AR game) was noted to be sparser in many minority neighborhoods in a reflection of American demographics.Players in rural areas also complained about the lack of Pokémon spawns, PokéStops, and gyms in their area.Pokémon Go was criticized for game accessibility issues by players with physical disabilities.The AbleGamers Foundation COO, Steve Spohn, said that when Pokémon Go was compared to other mobile games, it ""excludes disabled players to a significant degree"".\n\nPolice departments in various countries issued warnings, some tongue-in-cheek, regarding inattentive driving, trespassing, and being targeted by criminals due to being unaware of one\'s surroundings.In the state of New York, sex offenders are banned from playing the app while on parole.Bosnian players were warned to stay out of minefields left over from the 1990s Bosnian War.In Russia, a 21-year-old video blogger, Ruslan Sokolovsky, was arrested in September 2016 for two months after playing Pokémon Go at the Church of All Saints in Yekaterinburg, and eventually received a suspended sentence for three and a half years in prison for charges of blasphemy.\n\nPeople have suffered various injuries from accidents related to the game.In Japan, the first accident occurred within hours of the game\'s release.The first death in Japan attributed to Pokémon Go occurred in late August 2016.A distracted driver playing the game killed one woman and seriously injured another.The 39-year-old farmer did not notice the women crossing a street and struck them with his truck.The woman died of a broken neck.Japan\'s National Police Agency said it was the 79th Pokémon Go-related accident in the country.On August 11, 2016, a young girl in Cambodia was reportedly killed after being hit by a car while trying to capture a Pokémon on a road.The case was the first death related to Pokémon Go among Southeast Asian countries.In January 2017, Chinese-American civilian Jiansheng Chen was shot dead while playing Pokémon Go.\n\nAl-Azhar University in Cairo described the game as ""harmful mania.""A Cossack leader declared that it ""smacks of Satanism"", Kuwait banned the game from government sites, Indonesian officials deemed it a national security threat, and in Israel the IDF banned the game from Army bases out of security considerations.In Saudi Arabia, the General Secretariat of the Council of Senior Scholars declared, in light of a 2001 fatwa banning the Pokémon card game as a form of gambling, that the electronic app required a new ruling.This was also followed by both Indian and Malaysian Islamic leaders telling Indian and Malaysian Muslims to avoid the game.\n\nDuring Thailand\'s 2016 constitutional referendum polling, Pokémon Go players were told to refrain from entering polling stations.Thus the Thai National Broadcasting and Communications Commission intends to ask Niantic to remove Pokémon characters and PokéStops from locations such as government facilities, historic and religious sites, private property as well as dangerous spots such as narrow footpaths and rivers.Cambodia has banned the game in a former genocide site after Pokémon players showed up at the site.Vietnam has banned players from entering the government and defense offices.The Vietnamese Ministry of Information and Communications is also considering the game\'s negative impact to Vietnamese society, where many people left home at night, crossed the road or drove on the street with their eyes kept focused on phones, which brought the need to ban the game in the country.Following the move by other Southeast Asian neighbors, the Philippines also banned the game in all administration offices.According to a survey by Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF), around 4% of employers in Malaysia fired their staff for playing the game during working hours.\n\nRussia also voiced their concerns over the application, with Nikolay Nikiforov, the country\'s Minister of Communications and Mass Media, suspecting foreign intelligence agencies using the application to collect information, while some fundamentalist religious groups in the region claim it to be demonic.The Supreme Council of Virtual Space in Iran officially banned the game in August 2016 over security concerns.The same month, The Pentagon facility in U.S. restricted the use of the game on their property, citing security risks by collecting secret information.In the United Kingdom, 290 police incidents were reported to have occurred in July 2016 in the country due to the game.In September 2016, Niantic stopped supporting the CyanogenMod mobile operating system.This prevented users playing on CyanogenMod from playing the game from that point forward.\n\nIn India, the Gujarat High Court issued a notice to Niantic, the developer of the popular AR-based game, on the grounds of ""posing danger to public safety"".The notice was issued on a PIL (Public Interest Litigation) seeking a ban on the location-based AR reality game in India.In addition, a second PIL was filed against the developers of Pokémon Go for hurting religious sentiments by showing images of eggs in places of worship of different religious groups.But the Indian Government refused to ban the game.\n\nPokémon Gos targeted local advertising has been described by Shoshana Zuboff in The Age of Surveillance Capitalism as an experiment that initiated from Google to move targeted advertising from the digital domain (cost per click) into the physical domain (cost per visit) by the use of sponsored locations.""In the end we recognize that the probe was designed to explore the next frontier: the means of behavioral modification.The game about the game is, in fact, an experimental facsimile of surveillance capitalism\'s design for our future.""\n\nMultiple unofficial, third-party apps were created to correspond with Pokémon Go.Notable apps include ""Poké Radar"" and ""Helper for Pokémon Go"", where players can crowdsource much of the Pokémon that can be found in the game at a particular time.At its peak of popularity, ""Poké Radar"" hit #2 on the Apple App Store, behind Pokémon Go itself.\n\nAnother app, GoChat, which allows players to leave messages for other players at specific locations, accrued more than 1 million downloads in five days and reached the top 10 in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.However, the app\'s developer Jonathan Zarra chose to leave the app unmonetized and had financial trouble keeping the app\'s servers online until bringing on angel investor and board member Michael Robertson.After acquiring significant funding, the app reached over 2 million active users.According to RiskIQ, at least 215 fake versions of the game were available by July 17, 2016.Several of these fake apps contained malicious programming and viruses.\n\nLaunched on July 22, 2016, ""Pokévision"" enabled players to find exactly where Pokémon spawned and how much time was left until they despawned; the site used data hacked directly from the game.In the five days following the website\'s launch, 27 million unique visitors used the site.On July 31, multiple search apps and sites, including Pokévision, were disabled as they violated Niantic\'s terms of service.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Niantic responded by implementing changes and new features in the game which allowed players to easily play remotely.However, starting on August 1, 2021, Niantic began rolling back these changes as part of their Exploration Bonus Updates.Players in New Zealand and the United States were the first to receive the post-pandemic changes, and gradually, they were rolled out to the rest of the world ""in accordance with recommendations from global health organizations.""In fear of violations in health and personal safety regulations, as well as negatively impacting players with disabilities, the company has since received heavy criticism from the player base (including top players Brandon Tan and Nick Oyzon) due to their reverting safety measures implemented during the pandemic, in which gym and Pokéstop interaction distances were increased from 40 to 80 metres.Despite increasing rates of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in various U.S. states (resulting in overflowing hospitals), Niantic are firm on not keeping the pandemic bonuses.Players began boycotting Pokémon Go since in first week of August 2021.\n\nOn Twitter, the #HearUsNiantic started trending worldwide as fans and players voiced their censure towards Niantic\'s decision to remove the pandemic bonuses.A letter was sent to Niantic, which responded to the community by stating that the pandemic changes will not stay.As Niantic are an AR company, part of their business strategy is to sell user data by players after completing AR Mapping tasks where they can log their surroundings at marked PokéStops in their in-game maps.The reduced distance means an increased potential for Niantic to generate more revenue.Another reason for their changes is for Niantic to preserve their image of being an AR tech giant; on their blog post they stated that it is their ""mission"" to ""encourage outdoor exploration"" and ""to connect [people] to real places in the real world, and to visit places that are worth exploring.""Players have also speculated that Niantic is rolling back the pandemic bonuses to send players closer to sponsored businesses such as McDonald\'s (marked by a PokéStop or gym), from which Niantic has made a lot of money.\n\nList of

57,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Pokémon Go', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'Pokémon Go (stylized as Pokémon GO) is a 2016 augmented reality (AR) mobile game, part of the Pokémon franchise, developed and published by Niantic in collaboration with Nintendo and The Pokémon Company for iOS and Android devices.It uses mobile devices with GPS to locate, capture, train, and battle virtual Pokémon, which appear as if they are in the player\'s real-world location.The game is free-to-play; it uses a freemium business model combined with local advertising and supports in-app purchases for additional in-game items.The game launched with around 150 species of Pokémon, which had increased to around 700 by 2021.\n\nPokémon Go was released to mixed reviews; critics praised the concept but criticized technical problems.It was one of the most used and profitable mobile apps in 2016, having been downloaded more than 500 million times worldwide by the end of the year.It is credited with popularizing location-based and AR technology, promoting physical activity, and helping local businesses grow due to escalated foot traffic.However, it attracted controversy for contributing to accidents and creating public nuisances.Various governments expressed concerns about security, and some countries regulate its use.The game had over monthly active users by May 2018, over a billion global downloads by early 2019, and grossed more than in revenue by 2020.\n\nAfter establishing a game account, players create and customize their own avatars.Once created, an avatar is displayed on a map based on the player\'s geographical location.Features on the map include \'PokéStops\' and \'Pokémon Gyms\'.These PokéStops can be equipped with items called \'Lure Modules\', which attract additional wild, and occasionally rare, Pokémon.Gyms serve as battle locations for team-based king of the hill matches.PokéStops and Gyms are typically located at places of interest.These locations were initially re-purposed portals from Ingress, Niantic\'s previous augmented reality (AR) game.This has led to PokéStops and Pokémon Gyms being placed at dangerous or inconvenient locations, such as a now-deleted Gym at the Korean Demilitarized Zone and Bagram Airforce Base, which was abandoned by U.S. forces in July 2021.Since 2019, these locations also include submissions from Go players which are largely reviewed by other players.\n\nAs players move within their real world surroundings, their avatars move within the game\'s map.Different Pokémon species reside in different areas of the world; for example, Water-type Pokémon are generally found near water.When a player encounters a Pokémon, it may be viewed either in AR mode or with a live rendered, generic background.AR mode uses the camera and gyroscope on the player\'s mobile device to display an image of a Pokémon as though it were in the real world.Players can take screenshots of the Pokémon they encounter either with or without the AR mode activated.\n\nAlthough the game is free to play, it supports in-app purchases, where players can purchase additional Poké Balls and other in-game items.These items include Incense, which attracts Pokémon to the player as they move for sixty minutes, Lure Modules, which players use at PokéStops to attract Pokémon to their current location near the PokeStop, and Lucky Eggs, which double experience points gained for a thirty-minute period from use.All Pokémon are displayed with a Combat Power, which is a rough measure of how powerful that Pokémon is in battle.Generally, as players level up, they catch Pokémon with higher CP and Pokémon are somewhat harder to catch.The player can check how strong their Pokémon are by the ""Appraisal"" system.\n\nPlayers can customize their avatar\'s appearance with clothing options that differ in availability according to season, player level, and game sponsors.Clothing includes: hats, accessories, tops, bottoms, socks, footwear and bags.Most clothing aligns with either the look of a specific Pokémon, a specific team and/or Pokémon region.Many pieces of clothing are free, but pieces can also be purchased using coins, earned during select events, awarded as the player levels up, or received as a prize for special research completion.\n\nAnother way for a player to customize their avatar is with a pose.Poses, like clothing, are free, purchased, or awarded.Certain poses are event based and can only be earned during the event they are attached to.Once the event is over, there is no guarantee that the pose will be available in-game again.\n\nIn April 2024, Pokémon GO was updated to allow greater customization of player avatars.Customization now includes a limited number of different hair styles, the ability to adjust the weight of the avatar, and expanded options for skin color.This update was met with mass backlash from the playerbase, as the new avatars were perceived to be of inferior graphical quality in comparison to the outgoing models, and because the updated models interfered with some pre-update cosmetic items, of which many had been purchased by players.\n\nUnlike most other installments in the Pokémon series, players in Pokémon Go do not battle wild Pokémon to catch them.During an encounter with a wild Pokémon, a player may throw a Poké Ball at it by flicking it from the bottom of the screen up toward the Pokémon.If the Pokémon is caught, it will come under the ownership of the player.Factors in the success rate of catching a Pokémon include the Pokémon\'s catch rate, the timing, the type of Poké Ball used, etc.After catching a wild Pokémon, the player is awarded two types of in-game currencies: Candies and Stardust.The Candies awarded by a successful catch depend on what evolutionary chain a Pokémon belongs to.A player can use Stardust and Candies to raise a Pokémon\'s level and hence ""Combat Power"" (CP).However, only Candies are needed to evolve a Pokémon, except for certain Pokémon that might need special items.Each Pokémon evolution tree has its own type of Candy, which can only be used to evolve or level up.The maximum level a player can achieve was originally level 40, but expanded to 50 as of November 30, 2020.The player can also transfer the Pokémon back to the Pokémon Professor Willow to earn more Candies and create room for more Pokémon.Shiny Pokémon are available through multiple ways, mostly by chance.One popular goal of the game is to complete the entries in the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon logbook, by catching and evolving them to collect every one in it.\n\nIn September 2016, Niantic introduced a ""Buddy Pokémon"" feature, which allows players to pick a Pokémon to appear alongside them on the profile screen, and receive in-game rewards and bonuses based on the chosen Pokémon.The feature was released later that month.Certain Pokémon have different distances that they need to be walked in order to receive candy.The more the player walks in real time, the more candy they can earn.During the same update, Niantic made it impossible for players with rooted or jailbroken devices to log into the game in an effort to reduce and prevent cheating.\n\nOn January 20, 2018, Pokémon Go held the first Community Day, a monthly event that increases the appearance rate of a specific Pokémon and offer an exclusive move to the final evolution of the featured Pokémon only if caught or evolved during the event window.Players also have a higher chance to catch the Shiny variant of the featured Pokémon.The first Community Day featured Pikachu, with the exclusive move Surf to Raichu.\n\nThe game is regularly updated with new Pokémon, and as of March 25, 2022, there are just over 730 Pokémon in the game (not including regional varieties) out of a total 1008.\n\nRegional Pokémon are often released together, such as Hoenn region Pokémon released in December 2017, Alolan variants in May 2018, Sinnoh region Pokémon(along with the Sinnoh Stone item used to evolve them) released in October 2018, Unova region Pokémon (and the Unova Stone) in September 2019, Kalos region Pokémon in December 2020, and again more Alola region Pokémon in March 2022.\n\nMythical and legendary Pokémon are often released individually (or in pairs/trios) in special events or quests.The first Legendary Pokémon released was Groudon, in December 2017.The Mythical Pokémon Meltan and its evolved form, Melmetal are so far the only Pokémon to have made their debut on Pokémon Go.Their release coincided with the release of Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee!on the Nintendo Switch, Pokémon Go introduced the new Mythical Pokémon Meltan originally as a teaser, later to be available to capture only in Pokémon Go via a ""Mystery Box"" item that could be obtained through transferring Pokémon from Pokémon Go to either Nintendo Switch Pokémon games, or by completing new Research Tasks.\n\nIn August 2020, Mega Evolution came to Pokémon Go with four Pokémon able to Mega Evolve into five forms.\n\nPlayers earn experience points for various in-game activities.Players rise in level as they earn experience points (XP), with various features being progressively unlocked.Most-notably, at level five, the player can battle at a Pokémon Gym and join one of three color-coded teams (red for Team Valor, blue for Team Mystic, or yellow for Team Instinct), which act as factions battling for control of Gyms within the Pokémon Go world.\n\nIn June 2017, Niantic announced that the game mechanics of Gyms would be revamped for a more teamwork-oriented experience; Gyms were disabled on June 19, 2017, with the new Gyms being released with the next app update a few days later.As of the update, Gyms included a spinnable component to receive in-game items such as Potions and Poké Balls.Additionally, Gyms are capped at containing six Pokémon, each of which must be unique in that Gym.Coins are now earned based on the amount of time the defending Pokémon has been in a Gym, as opposed to a one-per-day gym defender bonus of 10 coins per current defending Pokémon.Legendary, Mythical and Buddy Pokémon cannot be placed in Gyms.\n\nIn July 2017, Raid Battles were introduced.Raid Battles consist of a group of players gathering to confront an over-leveled Pokémon located in a Gym.If the Pokémon is defeated, the players gain the chance to catch a regular version of it.Raid difficulties range from 1 to 5, with 1 being of the lowest difficulty, and 5 being the most difficult to defeat.Level 5 raids are exclusive to Legendary Pokémon.The first of these, Articuno and Lugia, were released on July 22, 2017, after the Go Fest, with Moltres and Zapdos following.From September to November, the 3 Legendary Beasts: Entei, Raikou and Suicune, were released shortly after, rotating regions every month.Following their departure, the Legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh appeared in Raid Battles from November 27, 2017, to December 12, 2017.In August 2020, level 3 Mega raids arrived with the introduction of Mega Evolution.At the same time, Level 2 and 4 raids were combined into Level 1 and 3 raids.\n\nIn May 2022, Raid Battle were updated to include the addition of Mega Legendary Pokémon, which were turned to 6 stars, the highest currently in the game.The only Pokémon included in these Raids were Mega Latios and Mega Latias.\n\nIn October 2022, a new form of raid battle called ""Elite Raids"" were introduced.Elite Raids differ to normal raids in a number of ways, most notably that they can only be battled in person, take 24 hours to start, and are extremely difficult, often requiring a large number of players to defeat the Pokémon.\n\nIn May 2023, another new form of raid battles were introduced called ""Shadow Raids"".Shadow Raids may only be battled in person and award the chance to catch a Shadow Pokémon upon defeat.During the battle, the Pokémon may become ""enraged"", increasing both attack and defence, but can be returned to normal using a ""Purified Gem"".\n\nIn December 2018, Niantic added player vs player Trainer Battles.In January 2020, Niantic rolled out an online battle format Go Battle League which allows players to fight other players worldwide.Unlike the Trainer Battles format introduced in 2018, Go Battle League does not require physical proximity, scanning QR code on each other\'s phone, knowing each other\'s friend code, or any other real-world interactions between players.Instead, participating players are automatically paired by the game server via some variant of the Elo rating system.\n\nIn July 2019, Pokémon Go introduced Team GO Rocket battles.Team GO Rocket NPCs could be battled at PokéStops indicated with it twitching and being a dark color or in Team GO Rocket Balloons which follow the player on the map.After victory, the player has the opportunity to capture a ""Shadow Pokémon"" which are relatively low-leveled, angry-looking Pokémon.Shadow Pokémon have a higher attack stat but a lower defense stat than a normal Pokémon.After capture, the player can choose to purify the Shadow Pokémon.Purified Pokémon are higher-leveled than their Shadow counterparts, can learn an exclusive move when purified, and need fewer candies to evolve.\n\nThe concept for the game was conceived in 2014 by Satoru Iwata of Nintendo and Tsunekazu Ishihara of The Pokémon Company as an April Fools\' Day collaboration with Google, called the Google Maps: Pokémon Challenge.Ishihara was a fan of developer Niantic\'s previous transreality game, Ingress, and saw the game\'s concept as a perfect match for the Pokémon series.Niantic, a subsidiary of Google, used the crowdsourced data from Ingress to populate the locations for PokéStops and gyms within Pokémon Go, data from Google Maps to spawn specific Pokémon on certain terrain, and map display from OpenStreetMap since December 2017.The game\'s application logic uses the open source Kubernetes system - and due to the game\'s sheer scale of users, a number of bugs with the Kubernetes system was discovered and later fixed.Niantic was spun off from Google as an independent company in 2015 following the company reorganization into Alphabet Inc.\n\nIn 2015, Ishihara dedicated his speech at the game\'s announcement on September 10 to Iwata, who had died two months earlier.Tatsuo Nomura, who joined Niantic in 2015 after he developed the Google Maps Pokémon Challenge, acted as Director and Product Manager for the game.The game\'s soundtrack was written by longtime Pokémon series composer, Junichi Masuda, who also assisted with some of the game\'s design.Among the game\'s graphic designers was Dennis Hwang, who previously created the logo of Gmail while working for Google.\n\nOn March 4, 2016, Niantic announced a Japan-exclusive beta test would begin later that month, allowing players to assist in refining the game before its full release.The beta test was later expanded to other countries.On April 7, it was announced that the beta would expand to Australia and New Zealand.Then, on May 16, the signups for the field test were opened to the United States.The test came to an end on June 30.\n\nAt the Comic-Con 2016, John Hanke, founder of Niantic, revealed the appearances of the three team leaders: Candela (Team Valor), Blanche (Team Mystic), and Spark (Team Instinct).Hanke conveyed that approximately 10% of the ideas for the game were implemented.Future updates, including the addition of trading, more Pokémon, implementation of Pokémon Centers at PokéStops, a patch for the ""three step glitch"", and easier training, were also confirmed.He also stated that Niantic would be continuing support for the game for ""years to come"".In an interview with TechCrunch in September 2016, Hanke hinted that player vs. player Pokémon battles would be released in a future update.In December 2016, coffeehouse chain Starbucks and telecommunications company Sprint collaborated with Nintendo to add PokéStops and gyms at certain locations of theirs throughout the United States.That same month, a companion app for Apple Watch devices was released, which allows users to receive notifications about nearby Pokémon, but does not allow for them to be caught.In January 2017, an additional 5,000 more Starbucks locations became available as gyms.In February 2017, an update was released which introduced over 100 species based in the Johto region from the second generation of the core Pokémon series, which were added alongside the original 151.The update also included the addition of new berries, new Pokémon encounter mechanics, and an expanded selection of avatar clothing options.Some of the Pokémon introduced in Ruby and Sapphire were added in late 2017, starting with a Halloween event in October and 50 more in December.A weather system was added alongside the latter, allowing real-world weather to affect gameplay.In November 2018, a game developed by Game Freak and heavily inspired by Pokémon Go, Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee! was released on the Nintendo Switch.This game will feature Pokémon Go style catching with Joy-Con and there has integration between the two games.In addition, new Pokémon Meltan was revealed in September, becoming the first new Pokémon to be released through Pokémon Go.On October 10, 2018, The Pokémon Company and Niantic announced plans to introduce Pokémon from Diamond and Pearl into Pokémon Go.On October 12, Niantic teased one of the Generation IV Pokémon that would be coming to Pokémon Go.On October 25, a feature known as Adventure Sync was announced, which will record the player\'s walking data in the background.On October 26, Niantic announced research tasks for Bug type Pokémon that will give players a chance to catch Shedinja throughout November.\n\nAccording to John Hanke in a January 2019 interview with Business Insider, 2018 saw Go become the game initially envisioned by Niantic.\n\nIn 2020, Niantic made major changes to gameplay mechanisms to account for the COVID-19 pandemic which saw many players unable to leave their homes to play.These development shift saw changes like the addition of indoor step tracking to count toward in-game distance challenges, long distance PVP battles, increased ""incense"" effectiveness, increased spawn points, and a doubled player radius.\n\nThe Pokémon Go Plus is a Bluetooth Low Energy wearable device, developed by Nintendo\'s Platform Technology Development division, that allows players to perform certain actions in the game without looking at their smart device.When a player is near a Pokémon or PokéStop, the Plus vibrates.The player can then press the button to capture the Pokémon or receive items from the PokéStop; the player cannot check what they have received until the next time they sign into the app onto their mobile device.The design consists of a Poké Ball and the shape of the Google Maps pin.The decision to create the device rather than create a smartwatch app was to increase uptake among players for whom a smartwatch is prohibitively expensive.It was released in the United Kingdom and North America on September 16, 2016.\n\nThe game\'s official launch began on July 6, 2016, with releases in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.Due to server strain from high demand upon release, Niantic CEO John Hanke stated that the release in other regions was to be ""paused until Niantic was comfortable"" fixing the issues.European releases started on July 13, and the game became available to most of the continent over the following ten days.The Japanese launch was initially reported to be on July 20; however, the game was delayed after a sponsorship deal with fast food chain McDonald\'s was leaked, instead releasing two days later.Although the game was proposed to be released in France on July 15, it was postponed until July 24 out of respect and due to safety concerns following a terrorist attack in Nice on July 14.Following the shut down of third-party apps and websites in late-July 2016—significantly reducing server strain—Niantic was able to continue pushing release worldwide.Central and South America and most of Southeast Asia subsequently saw releases in early August.Indonesia was the first Asian country to have the game playable, despite the game not being officially released in that region until August 6.\n\nIn South Korea, the game was not officially released as major restrictions on the use of online mapping data exist.However, due to a glitch, a small area around Sokcho in the northeastern part of the country was considered a part of Niantic\'s North Korea mapping region, making the game fully playable in that area.Numerous people took advantage of the gap to play the game.Bus tickets from the capital city of Seoul sold out and people living within Sokcho shared information on free Wi-Fi areas to tourists.Players also discovered a gym in Panmunjom, along the Korean Demilitarized Zone; however, Niantic later removed it from the game.Following the release of Pokémon Go in Japan, parts of Busan also became playable as parts of the city are considered part of Japan\'s mapping area due to the proximity of Tsushima Island.The game officially released in the country in January 2017.\n\nIn mainland China, Google services are banned by the Great Firewall, whereas the GPS function in the game is blocked by Niantic.Players of Pokémon Go in China have to download the game with App Store IDs from other regions and use VPN to access Google services in order to load the game, and some even use a GPS spoofing app to bypass the GPS blocking.Some players also downloaded a clone app called City Spirit Go, which was released shortly after Pokémon Go beta test in Japan.As of 2020, the official game is still unplayable in most parts of China with GPS modules being blocked in-game.\n\nDuring its launch in Southeast Asia in August 2016, the game officially excluded Myanmar, but users in Thailand discovered that the game was fully playable in border cities near the nation.The game was released in the Balkans, Macau, and Central Asia in September 2016, and was also released throughout Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia by the end of the year.\n\nOn September 11, 2018, the game appeared in Russia\'s App Store and Google Play Store over two years after the first launch.However, Niantic did not officially announce the release.\n\nIn May 2019, the game was released on the Samsung Galaxy Store.\n\nInvestors were buoyed by the response to the initial release of Pokémon Go on July 7, with Nintendo\'s share price rising by an initial 10% and by July 14 shares rose to as high as 50%.Despite Nintendo only owning a 32% stake in The Pokémon Company and an undisclosed stake in Niantic, Nintendo\'s market value increased by US$9 billion within five days of release of Pokémon Go.The trend continued for more than a week after the game\'s release and by July 19, the stock value of Nintendo more than doubled as compared to pre-release.Turnover sales reached a record-breaking ¥703.6 billion (US$6.6 billion); and trading of the stock accounted for a quarter of all trades on the Tokyo Stock Exchange\'s main board.The Financial Times believed that investors were speculating not on Pokémon Go as such, but on future Nintendo app releases being as successful as the company moves more into the mobile app market—an area they were historically reluctant to enter in the belief it would cannibalise its portable console and video game sales.Nintendo plans to release four more smartphone app games by March 2017, and investors remarked that Pokémon Go showed Nintendo still has some of the ""most valuable character intellectual property in the world"" with franchises such as Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid.\n\nBy July 22, Nintendo gained ¥1.8 trillion ($17.6 billion) in market capitalization since the game\'s launch.However, following clarification from Nintendo that the company did not produce Pokémon Go nor had tangible financial gains from it, its stock fell by 18%—equating to a ¥708 billion ($6.7 billion) loss in market value—on July 25.This was the largest single-day decline for Nintendo since 1990 and the maximum one-day exchange of finances allowed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.The company has an approximate 13% ""effective economic stake"" in the game, according to Macquarie Securities.\n\nThe surge in stocks extended beyond Nintendo, with Tomy, TV Tokyo, and the Bank of Kyoto, among other companies, all seeing significant gains.Similarly, Zagg, which owns a company that manufactures battery cases, saw a 25% rise in its stock in relation to Pokémon Go.\n\nAt launch, the game suffered from frequent server outages due to extreme usage.The global server usage expectation for the game was surpassed within 15 minutes of the game\'s release in Australia and New Zealand, and peaked at 50 times expected traffic, or 10 times the expected worst-case scenario.Frequent crashes and authentication errors plagued the game\'s release and persisted for several days.For the first two days after launch, players were unable to access the game through their Pokémon Trainer Club accounts; only Gmail-based accounts were able to gain access to the game.Servers again suffered frequent outages in Australia on July 11; players blamed people in the United Kingdom for bypassing local servers and using Australian ones to play the game before its official release.On July 16, a few hours after the release in many European countries, the game\'s servers temporarily went down.The outage was claimed by a hacking group called ""PoodleCorp"", who said they used a DDoS attack to take them down, although the problem was fixed later that day.The next day, the servers went down again as the game was launched in Canada.John Hanke issued an apology for the server issues at San Diego Comic Con 2016, stating ""we weren\'t provisioned for what happened"".\n\nSome early iOS installs of Pokémon Go required users to provide the app with full access to their Google accounts, thereby allowing the app to ""access players\' Gmail-based email, Google Drive-based files, photos and videos stored in Google Photos, and any other content within their Google accounts"".The Pokémon Company and Niantic responded to the concerns, recognizing that the iOS app, at the time, ""... erroneously requests full access permission for the user\'s Google account ...""However, Adam Reeve—the person who initially made claims of the security issues in a Tumblr post—later backtracked on his claim and was not ""100 percent sure"" it was valid.Dan Guido, CEO of the security company Trail of Bits, analyzed the app\'s programming and discovered that although the game did request full account access, this did not enable third-party usage as initially conveyed.Guido found that this did enable Niantic to access people\'s email addresses and phone numbers unintentionally.A subsequent iOS app update reduced the scope of access.Niantic also issued a statement assuring users that no information was collected nor was any information beyond what was necessary to use the app accessed.\n\nAlongside server issues, Pokémon Go suffered from several glitches.One of the more prominent bugs appeared in mid-July 2016 and rendered the game\'s tracking feature useless.Normally, this feature shows between zero and three footprints to inform the player of how close they are to a nearby Pokémon; however, it universally became ""stuck"" at three steps, earning it the name ""three-step-glitch"".Niantic removed the footstep feature altogether on July 30, sparking criticism from players.By August 1, players reported a new glitch that swaps their captured Pokémon with another creature at random.Another bug, confirmed by Niantic in August, inadvertently made capturing Pokémon more difficult.Some legendary Pokémon, which are rare and powerful versions of the creatures, were also obtained by players in a glitch, though they were later removed from the accounts of the trainers to keep the game fair.\n\nPokémon Go released to ""mixed or average"" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.Upon release, critics called the experience enjoyable, but noted the game\'s technical issues.\n\nCritics praised various aspects of Pokémon Go.Oscar Dayus (Pocket Gamer) said that the game was an immensely enjoyable experience and continued with how ""the very personal nature of catching Pokémon in your own neighborhood made me smile more than any game has for years"".Jeremy Parish (US Gamer) compared the game and its social aspects to a massively multiplayer online game.Reviewers also praised the game enabling the promotion of physical exercise.Terri Schwartz (IGN) said it was ""secretly the best exercise app out there"" and that it changed her daily walking routine.Patrick Allen (Lifehacker) wrote an article with tips about how to work out using Pokémon Go.Julia Belluz (Vox) said it could be the ""greatest unintentional health fad ever"" and wrote that one of the results of the game that the developers may not have realized was that ""it seems to be getting people moving"".Users took an extra 194 steps per day once they started using the app, which approximated to 26% more than usual.IGN named it the 100th best video game of all time in 2018.\n\nPhilip Kollar and Allegra Frank (Polygon) both agreed that Pokémon Go was ""an exciting social experience"", but were not sure how long the game and its popularity would last, stating it could either last for coming years or ""end up as a brush fire craze that the whole gaming world is talking about for a few weeks and then is forgotten"".\n\nOther critics expressed more negative opinions of the game, with many citing frequent crashes and other technical issues, along with shallow gameplay.Kallie Plagge (IGN) said that although the game lacked in polish and depth, the overall experience made up for it.Matt Peckham (Time) criticized the game for its frequent crashes.Mike Cosimano (Destructoid) also took issue with the game, saying the original idea showed promise, but was improperly executed.Kat Brewster (The Guardian) wrote that although she thought Pokémon Go was not a good game, it was ""a great experience"".The server problems also received negative press.Miguel Concepcion (GameSpot) said that although he enjoyed the game\'s strong social appeal and visual design, the game\'s ""initial iteration is a buggy mess on all levels"", with one of the reasons being the constant server problems.Another glitch that appeared a few days after launch was the ""three-step glitch"", which made it impossible to ""hunt down a specific Pokémon"".Patricia Hernandez (Kotaku) said, ""the three step glitch adds to what has been a terrible launch for Pokémon Go"".Critics also emphasized on the large gap between the rural and urban players.Rural players seem to be at a major disadvantage when playing the game, while city players have access to more PokéStops and Gyms.\n\nPokémon Go rapidly rose the American iOS App Store\'s ""Top Grossing"" and ""Free"" charts.The game has become the fastest game to top the App Store and Google Play, beating Clash Royale, and it became the most downloaded app on the App Store of any app in their first week.Within two days of release, it was installed on more than 5% of Android devices in the United States, according to SimilarWeb, According to Sensor Tower, the game was downloaded more than 10 million times within a week of release, becoming the fastest such app to do so, and reached 15 million global downloads by July 13.According to SurveyMonkey the game became the most active mobile game in the United States ever with 21 million active users on July 12, eclipsing Candy Crush Sagas peak of 20 million.By July 15, approximately 1.3 million people were playing the game in the Netherlands, despite the app not being officially released in the country at the time.On the day of release in Japan, more than 10 million people downloaded the game, including 1.3 million in the first three hours.By July 31, the game exceeded 100 million downloads worldwide, according to App Annie and Sensor Tower.On August 8, Pokémon Go reached the milestone of over 100 million downloads on Google Play alone after barely 33 days on the market.\n\nThrough in-game purchases, the game generated more than by the end of July 2016, with App Annie reporting that Pokémon Go had generated around in revenue every day that month.The same month, Sensor Tower reported that the game had passed more than in worldwide revenue, beating every existing record set by Clash of Clans and Candy Crush by a wide margin.On August 12, 2016, the Financial Times reported that Pokémon Go reached in revenue after five weeks counting only the U.S., British, and German markets.The average daily usage of the app on Android devices in July 2016 exceeded that of Snapchat, Tinder, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.Due by the game\'s massive popularity, several app developers became focused on developing similar AR apps using available software development kits (SDK).By September 2, 2016, Pokémon Go had generated more than $440 million in worldwide revenue, according to Sensor Tower.By September 30, it had received downloads and grossed in 80 days, according to market research firm Newzoo.Pokémon Go reached the milestone of $600 million in revenue after only 90 days on the market, becoming the fastest mobile game ever to do so.\n\nBesides in-game purchases, partnerships with retail chains like Starbucks, McDonald\'s, Sprint, pay Niantic Labs for ""Foot Traffic"" on-demand of the retail shops.\n\nThe game was awarded five Guinness World Records in August 2016: most revenue grossed by a mobile game in its first month (); most downloaded mobile game in its first month (130 million downloads); most international charts topped simultaneously for a mobile game in its first month (top game in 70 different countries); most international charts topped simultaneously for a mobile game in its first month (top grossing in 55 countries simultaneously); and fastest time to gross $100 million by a mobile game (reached in 20 days on July 26).By September 2016, Pokémon Go had been downloaded over 500 million times worldwide, and became the fastest game to make over $500 million in revenue.Pokémon Go was awarded the App Store\'s breakout hit of 2016.Pokémon Go was reported to be the most searched game on Google in 2016.\n\nUsage of the game in the United States peaked on July 15, and by mid-September, had lost 79% of its players there.Forbes said ""the vaguely curious stopped playing and the more committed players ran up against a fairly unsatisfying endgame"".In October 2016, Niantic released a Halloween-themed event, which saw a surge in revenue up to 133% as reported by Sensor Tower, placing the game back to top of the charts of highest grossing apps.It was reported that the game earned approximately $23.3 million between October 25 and 29, up from approximately $10 million between October 18 and 22.According to App Annie, Pokémon Go grossed an estimated in 2016.\n\nIn February 2017, Pokémon Go was awarded being the best app at the Crunchies award event.By February 2017, the game has been downloaded more than times worldwide, with a reported in revenue made, becoming the fastest mobile game ever to do so.By June 2017, the game was downloaded more than 750 million times, with an estimated revenue of according to Apptopia.According to mobile app research firm Apptopia, approximately 60 million users were still playing the game a year after launch.In May 2018, The Pokémon Company announced that the game reached over 800million downloads worldwide.Forbes estimated that the game may have come close to 900million downloads by September 2018.The top five countries where it has received the most downloads are the United States (21%), Brazil (9.3%), India (8.6%), Mexico (5.5%), and Indonesia (5%).As of February 2019, the game has been downloaded by over 1billion people worldwide.\n\nA report from SuperData Research ranked Pokémon Go as the 9th highest grossing mobile game of 2017, with an annual revenue of .Bloomberg estimated that Pokémon Go generated up to in total revenue by late 2017.Two years from its initial launch, analyst firm Sensor Tower estimated the game had grossed over from in-app purchases, reporting that players around the world continue to spend each day.SuperData Research reported that, in May 2018, Pokémon Go grossed in monthly revenue and had monthly active players, its highest since Summer 2016.In July 2018, Pokémon Go was the top-grossing mobile app of the month.Since the introduction of trading and friends features, Sensor Tower has reported that players spend an average of per day.Apptopia reported that, by September 2018, the game had grossed over from in-app purchases; the top five countries where it has received the most revenue are Japan (), the United States (), Germany (), the United Kingdom (), and Australia ().It was the fourth highest-grossing game of 2018, with , and in 2019 alone Pokémon Go earned , according to Superdata Research, a division of Nielsen Media Research.Pokémon Go live events earned in tourism revenue during 2019.According to Sensor Tower in November 2020, Pokémon Go had accumulated nearly unique installs and generated almost in revenue from in-game purchases via the iOS App Store and Google Play.Its largest market in terms of both installs and revenue is the United States, followed by Japan and Germany in revenue and by Brazil and Mexico in installs.\n\nDuring 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic causing restrictions on the ability of players to play Go outside their homes, Niantic implemented new features which allowed players to play the game from inside their homes, and this was credited with increasing its playerbase throughout the year despite the restrictions.Despite a brief drop early in the pandemic, the number of monthly active users of the game rose by 45 percent between January and August 2020, and the game\'s revenue in 2020 was the highest in its history, exceeding even its 2016 revenue.The game generated more than of revenue in the first 10 months of 2020 according to Sensor Tower, and it was the top-grossing mobile game of December 2020.Pokémon Go was one of the top five highest-grossing games of 2020 with an annual revenue of according to SuperData Research, bringing the game\'s cumulative revenue to by 2020.The game generated a further in the first half of 2021.\n\nThe game was referred to as a ""social media phenomenon"" which has brought people together from all walks of life.231 million people engaged in 1.1 billion interactions that mentioned Pokémon Go on Facebook and Instagram in the month of July.Numerous media outlets referred to the surge in popularity as ""Pokémon Go Mania"", or simply ""Pokémania"".The massive popularity of the game resulted in several unusual positive effects.For example, the game placed players where they can help catch criminals and report crimes in progress, although it has also placed some in harm\'s way, and has even aided law enforcement\'s community relations, albeit with caveats.Businesses also benefited from the nearby presence of PokéStops (or them being PokéStops themselves) with the concomitant influx of people, and the intense exploration of communities has brought local history to the forefront.The game was also seen bringing its players to places of worship, as many Pokégyms are located there.Despite some criticism by religious leaders, this was received positively by religious groups, who saw it as reminding adherents to come and pray.Some establishments considered purchasing lures in the game to attract additional players to PokéStops on their property.Within a week of its release, a secondary market emerged for the game, both for the resell of high-level accounts on Craigslist and PlayerUp, and for the sale of expert advice on Thumbtack.Wireless provider T-Mobile US started an offer for free data for a year for Pokémon Go sessions, and Yelp added a filter that only shows businesses which have a PokéStop nearby.National parks across the United States saw an influx of visitors due to the game, with ""hundreds or thousands"" of people visiting the National Mall and Memorial Parks in Washington, D.C. on the weekend following Pokémon Go release in the country.Small museums with PokéStops placed at exhibits also reported increased attendance, such as the McNay Art Museum in San Antonio, Texas, and the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens in Boca Raton, Florida.Charity organizations also sought engagement from players, with animal shelters offering dog walks to people who want to hatch eggs.\n\nEduardo Paes, then-mayor of Rio de Janeiro, stated that he hoped the app would be released in Brazil before the start of the 2016 Summer Olympics in the city (and it was, on August 3), and United States presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton mentioned the app during their 2016 election campaigns.In late July 2016, during a public address, the President of Italy, Sergio Mattarella, compared a political issue about the date of an incoming referendum as preposterous as the hunt for the Pokémon.Shortly after the game\'s release, Bellator mixed martial artist Michael Page celebrated a knockout of his match opponent, Evangelista Santos by putting on a red Ash Ketchum-like hat and rolling a prop Poké Ball in Santos\'s direction.On July 25, Dwayne Johnson released a promo video featuring MatPat and Ali-A with himself as a tough, rare Pokémon.\n\nThe game was credited for popularizing AR, and was praised by genderfluid groups for letting the players choose a ""style"" instead of ""gender"".The game also had a positive impact among individuals with autism.The ""Pokémon Theme"" from the animated series saw a 630% increase in listeners on music streaming platform Spotify during the month of the game\'s release.Meanwhile, streaming services such as Hulu experienced an increased viewership of the Pokémon series and films.Nintendo reported that sales of the 3DS Pokémon games rose as a result of the game\'s popularity.A Twitch channel, Twitch Plays Pokémon Go, was created that mimics the crowd-played Twitch Plays Pokémon channel, allowing viewers to direct a virtual avatar in the game using an iPhone programmed to spoof its location.Niantic later issued permanent bans to those who cheated the game by means such as GPS spoofing and bots.Pokémon-themed pornography increased in popularity after the release of the game.xHamster, an adult video streaming website, reported that within 5 days of the game\'s release, Pokémon related terms were the most searched for videos.Another adult video streaming website, Pornhub, reported that Pokémon related searches spiked 136%.Pokémon Go was spoofed in the Maroon 5 music video, ""Don\'t Wanna Know"".In the 2016 Doctor Who Christmas special, ""The Return of Doctor Mysterio"", the Doctor creates a distraction by ""flood[ing] the downstairs with Pokémon"", causing the people to run off with their cell phones.In the episode ""Looking for Mr. Goodbart"" from the 28th season of The Simpsons, the people of Springfield become addicted to Peekimon Get, a parody of Pokémon Go.\n\nGos release resulted in a resurgence in popularity for the Pokémon franchise as a whole.The Pokémon Sun and Moon games for the Nintendo 3DS, released later in 2016, was the best-selling video game for the 3DS with over 16 million copies sold, and this was partly attributed to the new fans to the series brought in by Go.In an interview, director of Sun and Moon Shigeru Ohmori remarked that the Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon sequels were designed partly to facilitate entry for newcomers to the franchise brought in by Go.The first Pokémon games for the Nintendo Switch, Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee!, took significant inspirations from Go.A line of official Go merchandise was released in November 2019.\n\nIn addition to standard gameplay, the game has held several in-game and live events.The first live event officially held by Niantic was held in Charlotte, North Carolina, in May 2017.In July 2017, a community event was held in Grant Park, Chicago, in honor of the first anniversary of the game\'s release.Despite the fact that almost no information about the event, including ticket prices and attractions, was released by Niantic ahead of the ticket sale, over 20,000 tickets sold out within a half hour.During the event itself, attendees suffered connectivity issues and crashes, due to the heavy amount of localized cellular activity.Afterwards, Niantic announced that they would refund everybody who bought a ticket, as well as give them $100 of in-game currency.Following the event, around two dozen attendees filed suit against Niantic, seeking travel reimbursement.\n\nFollowing the event in Chicago, other events have been held in Chester, Yokohama, and San Jose.In September 2017, a series of events named ""Safari Zone"" was held in Unibail-Rodamco shopping centers in Oberhausen, Paris and Barcelona, with events the following month in Copenhagen, Prague, Stockholm and Amstelveen.\n\nIn January 2018, Niantic announced monthly community event Community Day which aims to get players to meet up in their local areas.During a multi-hour period, players can encounter more frequent wild spawns of a particular Pokémon, an exclusive move for that Pokémon (or its evolution), an increased probability for the shiny form of that Pokémon, and bonuses such as extra stardust or XP.The Community Days in 2018 featured Pikachu (January 20), Dratini (February 24), Bulbasaur (March 25), Mareep (April 15), Charmander (May 19), Larvitar (June 16), Squirtle (July 8), Eevee (August 11–12), Chikorita (September 22), Beldum (October 21), and Cyndaquil (November 10).\n\nPokémon Go in Syria is a photography series published in 2016 by Syrian artist Khaled Akil.Akil places Pokémon characters in destroyed Syrian streets as a reminder for a world lost behind the screen.While Pokémon Go was trending worldwide, Akil couldn\'t help but notice how the media forgot about the war in Syria, and visualised his idea in the form of digital collages.Khaled\'s Pokémon series quickly went viral across the globe after he posted it online.This photography series was exhibited in various locations including the American University Museum.\n\nThe app was criticized for using locations such as cemeteries and memorials as sites to catch Pokémon, including the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, Arlington National Cemetery, the ANZAC War Memorial, and Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.Niantic later removed content from sensitive areas such as the Hiroshima Memorial and Holocaust Museum.The game sparked complaints from Dutch company ProRail, who said that players entered their railway tracks, and fire stations told players to not impede their staff by congregating outside.\n\nThe game\'s distribution of PokéStops and gyms (derived from the portals in Ingress, Niantic\'s science fiction-themed AR game) was noted to be sparser in many minority neighborhoods in a reflection of American demographics.Players in rural areas also complained about the lack of Pokémon spawns, PokéStops, and gyms in their area.Pokémon Go was criticized for game accessibility issues by players with physical disabilities.The AbleGamers Foundation COO, Steve Spohn, said that when Pokémon Go was compared to other mobile games, it ""excludes disabled players to a significant degree"".\n\nPolice departments in various countries issued warnings, some tongue-in-cheek, regarding inattentive driving, trespassing, and being targeted by criminals due to being unaware of one\'s surroundings.In the state of New York, sex offenders are banned from playing the app while on parole.Bosnian players were warned to stay out of minefields left over from the 1990s Bosnian War.In Russia, a 21-year-old video blogger, Ruslan Sokolovsky, was arrested in September 2016 for two months after playing Pokémon Go at the Church of All Saints in Yekaterinburg, and eventually received a suspended sentence for three and a half years in prison for charges of blasphemy.\n\nPeople have suffered various injuries from accidents related to the game.In Japan, the first accident occurred within hours of the game\'s release.The first death in Japan attributed to Pokémon Go occurred in late August 2016.A distracted driver playing the game killed one woman and seriously injured another.The 39-year-old farmer did not notice the women crossing a street and struck them with his truck.The woman died of a broken neck.Japan\'s National Police Agency said it was the 79th Pokémon Go-related accident in the country.On August 11, 2016, a young girl in Cambodia was reportedly killed after being hit by a car while trying to capture a Pokémon on a road.The case was the first death related to Pokémon Go among Southeast Asian countries.In January 2017, Chinese-American civilian Jiansheng Chen was shot dead while playing Pokémon Go.\n\nAl-Azhar University in Cairo described the game as ""harmful mania.""A Cossack leader declared that it ""smacks of Satanism"", Kuwait banned the game from government sites, Indonesian officials deemed it a national security threat, and in Israel the IDF banned the game from Army bases out of security considerations.In Saudi Arabia, the General Secretariat of the Council of Senior Scholars declared, in light of a 2001 fatwa banning the Pokémon card game as a form of gambling, that the electronic app required a new ruling.This was also followed by both Indian and Malaysian Islamic leaders telling Indian and Malaysian Muslims to avoid the game.\n\nDuring Thailand\'s 2016 constitutional referendum polling, Pokémon Go players were told to refrain from entering polling stations.Thus the Thai National Broadcasting and Communications Commission intends to ask Niantic to remove Pokémon characters and PokéStops from locations such as government facilities, historic and religious sites, private property as well as dangerous spots such as narrow footpaths and rivers.Cambodia has banned the game in a former genocide site after Pokémon players showed up at the site.Vietnam has banned players from entering the government and defense offices.The Vietnamese Ministry of Information and Communications is also considering the game\'s negative impact to Vietnamese society, where many people left home at night, crossed the road or drove on the street with their eyes kept focused on phones, which brought the need to ban the game in the country.Following the move by other Southeast Asian neighbors, the Philippines also banned the game in all administration offices.According to a survey by Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF), around 4% of employers in Malaysia fired their staff for playing the game during working hours.\n\nRussia also voiced their concerns over the application, with Nikolay Nikiforov, the country\'s Minister of Communications and Mass Media, suspecting foreign intelligence agencies using the application to collect information, while some fundamentalist religious groups in the region claim it to be demonic.The Supreme Council of Virtual Space in Iran officially banned the game in August 2016 over security concerns.The same month, The Pentagon facility in U.S. restricted the use of the game on their property, citing security risks by collecting secret information.In the United Kingdom, 290 police incidents were reported to have occurred in July 2016 in the country due to the game.In September 2016, Niantic stopped supporting the CyanogenMod mobile operating system.This prevented users playing on CyanogenMod from playing the game from that point forward.\n\nIn India, the Gujarat High Court issued a notice to Niantic, the developer of the popular AR-based game, on the grounds of ""posing danger to public safety"".The notice was issued on a PIL (Public Interest Litigation) seeking a ban on the location-based AR reality game in India.In addition, a second PIL was filed against the developers of Pokémon Go for hurting religious sentiments by showing images of eggs in places of worship of different religious groups.But the Indian Government refused to ban the game.\n\nPokémon Gos targeted local advertising has been described by Shoshana Zuboff in The Age of Surveillance Capitalism as an experiment that initiated from Google to move targeted advertising from the digital domain (cost per click) into the physical domain (cost per visit) by the use of sponsored locations.""In the end we recognize that the probe was designed to explore the next frontier: the means of behavioral modification.The game about the game is, in fact, an experimental facsimile of surveillance capitalism\'s design for our future.""\n\nMultiple unofficial, third-party apps were created to correspond with Pokémon Go.Notable apps include ""Poké Radar"" and ""Helper for Pokémon Go"", where players can crowdsource much of the Pokémon that can be found in the game at a particular time.At its peak of popularity, ""Poké Radar"" hit #2 on the Apple App Store, behind Pokémon Go itself.\n\nAnother app, GoChat, which allows players to leave messages for other players at specific locations, accrued more than 1 million downloads in five days and reached the top 10 in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.However, the app\'s developer Jonathan Zarra chose to leave the app unmonetized and had financial trouble keeping the app\'s servers online until bringing on angel investor and board member Michael Robertson.After acquiring significant funding, the app reached over 2 million active users.According to RiskIQ, at least 215 fake versions of the game were available by July 17, 2016.Several of these fake apps contained malicious programming and viruses.\n\nLaunched on July 22, 2016, ""Pokévision"" enabled players to find exactly where Pokémon spawned and how much time was left until they despawned; the site used data hacked directly from the game.In the five days following the website\'s launch, 27 million unique visitors used the site.On July 31, multiple search apps and sites, including Pokévision, were disabled as they violated Niantic\'s terms of service.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Niantic responded by implementing changes and new features in the game which allowed players to easily play remotely.However, starting on August 1, 2021, Niantic began rolling back these changes as part of their Exploration Bonus Updates.Players in New Zealand and the United States were the first to receive the post-pandemic changes, and gradually, they were rolled out to the rest of the world ""in accordance with recommendations from global health organizations.""In fear of violations in health and personal safety regulations, as well as negatively impacting players with disabilities, the company has since received heavy criticism from the player base (including top players Brandon Tan and Nick Oyzon) due to their reverting safety measures implemented during the pandemic, in which gym and Pokéstop interaction distances were increased from 40 to 80 metres.Despite increasing rates of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in various U.S. states (resulting in overflowing hospitals), Niantic are firm on not keeping the pandemic bonuses.Players began boycotting Pokémon Go since in first week of August 2021.\n\nOn Twitter, the #HearUsNiantic started trending worldwide as fans and players voiced their censure towards Niantic\'s decision to remove the pandemic bonuses.A letter was sent to Niantic, which responded to the community by stating that the pandemic changes will not stay.As Niantic are an AR company, part of their business strategy is to sell user data by players after completing AR Mapping tasks where they can log their surroundings at marked PokéStops in their in-game maps.The reduced distance means an increased potential for Niantic to generate more revenue.Another reason for their changes is for Niantic to preserve their image of being an AR tech giant; on their blog post they stated that it is their ""mission"" to ""encourage outdoor exploration"" and ""to connect [people] to real places in the real world, and to visit places that are worth exploring.""Players have also speculated that Niantic is rolling back the pandemic bonuses to send players closer to sponsored businesses such as McDonald\'s (marked by a PokéStop or gym), from which Niantic has made a lot of money.\n\nList of

58,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Pokémon Go', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'Pokémon Go (stylized as Pokémon GO) is a 2016 augmented reality (AR) mobile game, part of the Pokémon franchise, developed and published by Niantic in collaboration with Nintendo and The Pokémon Company for iOS and Android devices.It uses mobile devices with GPS to locate, capture, train, and battle virtual Pokémon, which appear as if they are in the player\'s real-world location.The game is free-to-play; it uses a freemium business model combined with local advertising and supports in-app purchases for additional in-game items.The game launched with around 150 species of Pokémon, which had increased to around 700 by 2021.\n\nPokémon Go was released to mixed reviews; critics praised the concept but criticized technical problems.It was one of the most used and profitable mobile apps in 2016, having been downloaded more than 500 million times worldwide by the end of the year.It is credited with popularizing location-based and AR technology, promoting physical activity, and helping local businesses grow due to escalated foot traffic.However, it attracted controversy for contributing to accidents and creating public nuisances.Various governments expressed concerns about security, and some countries regulate its use.The game had over monthly active users by May 2018, over a billion global downloads by early 2019, and grossed more than in revenue by 2020.\n\nAfter establishing a game account, players create and customize their own avatars.Once created, an avatar is displayed on a map based on the player\'s geographical location.Features on the map include \'PokéStops\' and \'Pokémon Gyms\'.These PokéStops can be equipped with items called \'Lure Modules\', which attract additional wild, and occasionally rare, Pokémon.Gyms serve as battle locations for team-based king of the hill matches.PokéStops and Gyms are typically located at places of interest.These locations were initially re-purposed portals from Ingress, Niantic\'s previous augmented reality (AR) game.This has led to PokéStops and Pokémon Gyms being placed at dangerous or inconvenient locations, such as a now-deleted Gym at the Korean Demilitarized Zone and Bagram Airforce Base, which was abandoned by U.S. forces in July 2021.Since 2019, these locations also include submissions from Go players which are largely reviewed by other players.\n\nAs players move within their real world surroundings, their avatars move within the game\'s map.Different Pokémon species reside in different areas of the world; for example, Water-type Pokémon are generally found near water.When a player encounters a Pokémon, it may be viewed either in AR mode or with a live rendered, generic background.AR mode uses the camera and gyroscope on the player\'s mobile device to display an image of a Pokémon as though it were in the real world.Players can take screenshots of the Pokémon they encounter either with or without the AR mode activated.\n\nAlthough the game is free to play, it supports in-app purchases, where players can purchase additional Poké Balls and other in-game items.These items include Incense, which attracts Pokémon to the player as they move for sixty minutes, Lure Modules, which players use at PokéStops to attract Pokémon to their current location near the PokeStop, and Lucky Eggs, which double experience points gained for a thirty-minute period from use.All Pokémon are displayed with a Combat Power, which is a rough measure of how powerful that Pokémon is in battle.Generally, as players level up, they catch Pokémon with higher CP and Pokémon are somewhat harder to catch.The player can check how strong their Pokémon are by the ""Appraisal"" system.\n\nPlayers can customize their avatar\'s appearance with clothing options that differ in availability according to season, player level, and game sponsors.Clothing includes: hats, accessories, tops, bottoms, socks, footwear and bags.Most clothing aligns with either the look of a specific Pokémon, a specific team and/or Pokémon region.Many pieces of clothing are free, but pieces can also be purchased using coins, earned during select events, awarded as the player levels up, or received as a prize for special research completion.\n\nAnother way for a player to customize their avatar is with a pose.Poses, like clothing, are free, purchased, or awarded.Certain poses are event based and can only be earned during the event they are attached to.Once the event is over, there is no guarantee that the pose will be available in-game again.\n\nIn April 2024, Pokémon GO was updated to allow greater customization of player avatars.Customization now includes a limited number of different hair styles, the ability to adjust the weight of the avatar, and expanded options for skin color.This update was met with mass backlash from the playerbase, as the new avatars were perceived to be of inferior graphical quality in comparison to the outgoing models, and because the updated models interfered with some pre-update cosmetic items, of which many had been purchased by players.\n\nUnlike most other installments in the Pokémon series, players in Pokémon Go do not battle wild Pokémon to catch them.During an encounter with a wild Pokémon, a player may throw a Poké Ball at it by flicking it from the bottom of the screen up toward the Pokémon.If the Pokémon is caught, it will come under the ownership of the player.Factors in the success rate of catching a Pokémon include the Pokémon\'s catch rate, the timing, the type of Poké Ball used, etc.After catching a wild Pokémon, the player is awarded two types of in-game currencies: Candies and Stardust.The Candies awarded by a successful catch depend on what evolutionary chain a Pokémon belongs to.A player can use Stardust and Candies to raise a Pokémon\'s level and hence ""Combat Power"" (CP).However, only Candies are needed to evolve a Pokémon, except for certain Pokémon that might need special items.Each Pokémon evolution tree has its own type of Candy, which can only be used to evolve or level up.The maximum level a player can achieve was originally level 40, but expanded to 50 as of November 30, 2020.The player can also transfer the Pokémon back to the Pokémon Professor Willow to earn more Candies and create room for more Pokémon.Shiny Pokémon are available through multiple ways, mostly by chance.One popular goal of the game is to complete the entries in the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon logbook, by catching and evolving them to collect every one in it.\n\nIn September 2016, Niantic introduced a ""Buddy Pokémon"" feature, which allows players to pick a Pokémon to appear alongside them on the profile screen, and receive in-game rewards and bonuses based on the chosen Pokémon.The feature was released later that month.Certain Pokémon have different distances that they need to be walked in order to receive candy.The more the player walks in real time, the more candy they can earn.During the same update, Niantic made it impossible for players with rooted or jailbroken devices to log into the game in an effort to reduce and prevent cheating.\n\nOn January 20, 2018, Pokémon Go held the first Community Day, a monthly event that increases the appearance rate of a specific Pokémon and offer an exclusive move to the final evolution of the featured Pokémon only if caught or evolved during the event window.Players also have a higher chance to catch the Shiny variant of the featured Pokémon.The first Community Day featured Pikachu, with the exclusive move Surf to Raichu.\n\nThe game is regularly updated with new Pokémon, and as of March 25, 2022, there are just over 730 Pokémon in the game (not including regional varieties) out of a total 1008.\n\nRegional Pokémon are often released together, such as Hoenn region Pokémon released in December 2017, Alolan variants in May 2018, Sinnoh region Pokémon(along with the Sinnoh Stone item used to evolve them) released in October 2018, Unova region Pokémon (and the Unova Stone) in September 2019, Kalos region Pokémon in December 2020, and again more Alola region Pokémon in March 2022.\n\nMythical and legendary Pokémon are often released individually (or in pairs/trios) in special events or quests.The first Legendary Pokémon released was Groudon, in December 2017.The Mythical Pokémon Meltan and its evolved form, Melmetal are so far the only Pokémon to have made their debut on Pokémon Go.Their release coincided with the release of Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee!on the Nintendo Switch, Pokémon Go introduced the new Mythical Pokémon Meltan originally as a teaser, later to be available to capture only in Pokémon Go via a ""Mystery Box"" item that could be obtained through transferring Pokémon from Pokémon Go to either Nintendo Switch Pokémon games, or by completing new Research Tasks.\n\nIn August 2020, Mega Evolution came to Pokémon Go with four Pokémon able to Mega Evolve into five forms.\n\nPlayers earn experience points for various in-game activities.Players rise in level as they earn experience points (XP), with various features being progressively unlocked.Most-notably, at level five, the player can battle at a Pokémon Gym and join one of three color-coded teams (red for Team Valor, blue for Team Mystic, or yellow for Team Instinct), which act as factions battling for control of Gyms within the Pokémon Go world.\n\nIn June 2017, Niantic announced that the game mechanics of Gyms would be revamped for a more teamwork-oriented experience; Gyms were disabled on June 19, 2017, with the new Gyms being released with the next app update a few days later.As of the update, Gyms included a spinnable component to receive in-game items such as Potions and Poké Balls.Additionally, Gyms are capped at containing six Pokémon, each of which must be unique in that Gym.Coins are now earned based on the amount of time the defending Pokémon has been in a Gym, as opposed to a one-per-day gym defender bonus of 10 coins per current defending Pokémon.Legendary, Mythical and Buddy Pokémon cannot be placed in Gyms.\n\nIn July 2017, Raid Battles were introduced.Raid Battles consist of a group of players gathering to confront an over-leveled Pokémon located in a Gym.If the Pokémon is defeated, the players gain the chance to catch a regular version of it.Raid difficulties range from 1 to 5, with 1 being of the lowest difficulty, and 5 being the most difficult to defeat.Level 5 raids are exclusive to Legendary Pokémon.The first of these, Articuno and Lugia, were released on July 22, 2017, after the Go Fest, with Moltres and Zapdos following.From September to November, the 3 Legendary Beasts: Entei, Raikou and Suicune, were released shortly after, rotating regions every month.Following their departure, the Legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh appeared in Raid Battles from November 27, 2017, to December 12, 2017.In August 2020, level 3 Mega raids arrived with the introduction of Mega Evolution.At the same time, Level 2 and 4 raids were combined into Level 1 and 3 raids.\n\nIn May 2022, Raid Battle were updated to include the addition of Mega Legendary Pokémon, which were turned to 6 stars, the highest currently in the game.The only Pokémon included in these Raids were Mega Latios and Mega Latias.\n\nIn October 2022, a new form of raid battle called ""Elite Raids"" were introduced.Elite Raids differ to normal raids in a number of ways, most notably that they can only be battled in person, take 24 hours to start, and are extremely difficult, often requiring a large number of players to defeat the Pokémon.\n\nIn May 2023, another new form of raid battles were introduced called ""Shadow Raids"".Shadow Raids may only be battled in person and award the chance to catch a Shadow Pokémon upon defeat.During the battle, the Pokémon may become ""enraged"", increasing both attack and defence, but can be returned to normal using a ""Purified Gem"".\n\nIn December 2018, Niantic added player vs player Trainer Battles.In January 2020, Niantic rolled out an online battle format Go Battle League which allows players to fight other players worldwide.Unlike the Trainer Battles format introduced in 2018, Go Battle League does not require physical proximity, scanning QR code on each other\'s phone, knowing each other\'s friend code, or any other real-world interactions between players.Instead, participating players are automatically paired by the game server via some variant of the Elo rating system.\n\nIn July 2019, Pokémon Go introduced Team GO Rocket battles.Team GO Rocket NPCs could be battled at PokéStops indicated with it twitching and being a dark color or in Team GO Rocket Balloons which follow the player on the map.After victory, the player has the opportunity to capture a ""Shadow Pokémon"" which are relatively low-leveled, angry-looking Pokémon.Shadow Pokémon have a higher attack stat but a lower defense stat than a normal Pokémon.After capture, the player can choose to purify the Shadow Pokémon.Purified Pokémon are higher-leveled than their Shadow counterparts, can learn an exclusive move when purified, and need fewer candies to evolve.\n\nThe concept for the game was conceived in 2014 by Satoru Iwata of Nintendo and Tsunekazu Ishihara of The Pokémon Company as an April Fools\' Day collaboration with Google, called the Google Maps: Pokémon Challenge.Ishihara was a fan of developer Niantic\'s previous transreality game, Ingress, and saw the game\'s concept as a perfect match for the Pokémon series.Niantic, a subsidiary of Google, used the crowdsourced data from Ingress to populate the locations for PokéStops and gyms within Pokémon Go, data from Google Maps to spawn specific Pokémon on certain terrain, and map display from OpenStreetMap since December 2017.The game\'s application logic uses the open source Kubernetes system - and due to the game\'s sheer scale of users, a number of bugs with the Kubernetes system was discovered and later fixed.Niantic was spun off from Google as an independent company in 2015 following the company reorganization into Alphabet Inc.\n\nIn 2015, Ishihara dedicated his speech at the game\'s announcement on September 10 to Iwata, who had died two months earlier.Tatsuo Nomura, who joined Niantic in 2015 after he developed the Google Maps Pokémon Challenge, acted as Director and Product Manager for the game.The game\'s soundtrack was written by longtime Pokémon series composer, Junichi Masuda, who also assisted with some of the game\'s design.Among the game\'s graphic designers was Dennis Hwang, who previously created the logo of Gmail while working for Google.\n\nOn March 4, 2016, Niantic announced a Japan-exclusive beta test would begin later that month, allowing players to assist in refining the game before its full release.The beta test was later expanded to other countries.On April 7, it was announced that the beta would expand to Australia and New Zealand.Then, on May 16, the signups for the field test were opened to the United States.The test came to an end on June 30.\n\nAt the Comic-Con 2016, John Hanke, founder of Niantic, revealed the appearances of the three team leaders: Candela (Team Valor), Blanche (Team Mystic), and Spark (Team Instinct).Hanke conveyed that approximately 10% of the ideas for the game were implemented.Future updates, including the addition of trading, more Pokémon, implementation of Pokémon Centers at PokéStops, a patch for the ""three step glitch"", and easier training, were also confirmed.He also stated that Niantic would be continuing support for the game for ""years to come"".In an interview with TechCrunch in September 2016, Hanke hinted that player vs. player Pokémon battles would be released in a future update.In December 2016, coffeehouse chain Starbucks and telecommunications company Sprint collaborated with Nintendo to add PokéStops and gyms at certain locations of theirs throughout the United States.That same month, a companion app for Apple Watch devices was released, which allows users to receive notifications about nearby Pokémon, but does not allow for them to be caught.In January 2017, an additional 5,000 more Starbucks locations became available as gyms.In February 2017, an update was released which introduced over 100 species based in the Johto region from the second generation of the core Pokémon series, which were added alongside the original 151.The update also included the addition of new berries, new Pokémon encounter mechanics, and an expanded selection of avatar clothing options.Some of the Pokémon introduced in Ruby and Sapphire were added in late 2017, starting with a Halloween event in October and 50 more in December.A weather system was added alongside the latter, allowing real-world weather to affect gameplay.In November 2018, a game developed by Game Freak and heavily inspired by Pokémon Go, Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee! was released on the Nintendo Switch.This game will feature Pokémon Go style catching with Joy-Con and there has integration between the two games.In addition, new Pokémon Meltan was revealed in September, becoming the first new Pokémon to be released through Pokémon Go.On October 10, 2018, The Pokémon Company and Niantic announced plans to introduce Pokémon from Diamond and Pearl into Pokémon Go.On October 12, Niantic teased one of the Generation IV Pokémon that would be coming to Pokémon Go.On October 25, a feature known as Adventure Sync was announced, which will record the player\'s walking data in the background.On October 26, Niantic announced research tasks for Bug type Pokémon that will give players a chance to catch Shedinja throughout November.\n\nAccording to John Hanke in a January 2019 interview with Business Insider, 2018 saw Go become the game initially envisioned by Niantic.\n\nIn 2020, Niantic made major changes to gameplay mechanisms to account for the COVID-19 pandemic which saw many players unable to leave their homes to play.These development shift saw changes like the addition of indoor step tracking to count toward in-game distance challenges, long distance PVP battles, increased ""incense"" effectiveness, increased spawn points, and a doubled player radius.\n\nThe Pokémon Go Plus is a Bluetooth Low Energy wearable device, developed by Nintendo\'s Platform Technology Development division, that allows players to perform certain actions in the game without looking at their smart device.When a player is near a Pokémon or PokéStop, the Plus vibrates.The player can then press the button to capture the Pokémon or receive items from the PokéStop; the player cannot check what they have received until the next time they sign into the app onto their mobile device.The design consists of a Poké Ball and the shape of the Google Maps pin.The decision to create the device rather than create a smartwatch app was to increase uptake among players for whom a smartwatch is prohibitively expensive.It was released in the United Kingdom and North America on September 16, 2016.\n\nThe game\'s official launch began on July 6, 2016, with releases in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.Due to server strain from high demand upon release, Niantic CEO John Hanke stated that the release in other regions was to be ""paused until Niantic was comfortable"" fixing the issues.European releases started on July 13, and the game became available to most of the continent over the following ten days.The Japanese launch was initially reported to be on July 20; however, the game was delayed after a sponsorship deal with fast food chain McDonald\'s was leaked, instead releasing two days later.Although the game was proposed to be released in France on July 15, it was postponed until July 24 out of respect and due to safety concerns following a terrorist attack in Nice on July 14.Following the shut down of third-party apps and websites in late-July 2016—significantly reducing server strain—Niantic was able to continue pushing release worldwide.Central and South America and most of Southeast Asia subsequently saw releases in early August.Indonesia was the first Asian country to have the game playable, despite the game not being officially released in that region until August 6.\n\nIn South Korea, the game was not officially released as major restrictions on the use of online mapping data exist.However, due to a glitch, a small area around Sokcho in the northeastern part of the country was considered a part of Niantic\'s North Korea mapping region, making the game fully playable in that area.Numerous people took advantage of the gap to play the game.Bus tickets from the capital city of Seoul sold out and people living within Sokcho shared information on free Wi-Fi areas to tourists.Players also discovered a gym in Panmunjom, along the Korean Demilitarized Zone; however, Niantic later removed it from the game.Following the release of Pokémon Go in Japan, parts of Busan also became playable as parts of the city are considered part of Japan\'s mapping area due to the proximity of Tsushima Island.The game officially released in the country in January 2017.\n\nIn mainland China, Google services are banned by the Great Firewall, whereas the GPS function in the game is blocked by Niantic.Players of Pokémon Go in China have to download the game with App Store IDs from other regions and use VPN to access Google services in order to load the game, and some even use a GPS spoofing app to bypass the GPS blocking.Some players also downloaded a clone app called City Spirit Go, which was released shortly after Pokémon Go beta test in Japan.As of 2020, the official game is still unplayable in most parts of China with GPS modules being blocked in-game.\n\nDuring its launch in Southeast Asia in August 2016, the game officially excluded Myanmar, but users in Thailand discovered that the game was fully playable in border cities near the nation.The game was released in the Balkans, Macau, and Central Asia in September 2016, and was also released throughout Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia by the end of the year.\n\nOn September 11, 2018, the game appeared in Russia\'s App Store and Google Play Store over two years after the first launch.However, Niantic did not officially announce the release.\n\nIn May 2019, the game was released on the Samsung Galaxy Store.\n\nInvestors were buoyed by the response to the initial release of Pokémon Go on July 7, with Nintendo\'s share price rising by an initial 10% and by July 14 shares rose to as high as 50%.Despite Nintendo only owning a 32% stake in The Pokémon Company and an undisclosed stake in Niantic, Nintendo\'s market value increased by US$9 billion within five days of release of Pokémon Go.The trend continued for more than a week after the game\'s release and by July 19, the stock value of Nintendo more than doubled as compared to pre-release.Turnover sales reached a record-breaking ¥703.6 billion (US$6.6 billion); and trading of the stock accounted for a quarter of all trades on the Tokyo Stock Exchange\'s main board.The Financial Times believed that investors were speculating not on Pokémon Go as such, but on future Nintendo app releases being as successful as the company moves more into the mobile app market—an area they were historically reluctant to enter in the belief it would cannibalise its portable console and video game sales.Nintendo plans to release four more smartphone app games by March 2017, and investors remarked that Pokémon Go showed Nintendo still has some of the ""most valuable character intellectual property in the world"" with franchises such as Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid.\n\nBy July 22, Nintendo gained ¥1.8 trillion ($17.6 billion) in market capitalization since the game\'s launch.However, following clarification from Nintendo that the company did not produce Pokémon Go nor had tangible financial gains from it, its stock fell by 18%—equating to a ¥708 billion ($6.7 billion) loss in market value—on July 25.This was the largest single-day decline for Nintendo since 1990 and the maximum one-day exchange of finances allowed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.The company has an approximate 13% ""effective economic stake"" in the game, according to Macquarie Securities.\n\nThe surge in stocks extended beyond Nintendo, with Tomy, TV Tokyo, and the Bank of Kyoto, among other companies, all seeing significant gains.Similarly, Zagg, which owns a company that manufactures battery cases, saw a 25% rise in its stock in relation to Pokémon Go.\n\nAt launch, the game suffered from frequent server outages due to extreme usage.The global server usage expectation for the game was surpassed within 15 minutes of the game\'s release in Australia and New Zealand, and peaked at 50 times expected traffic, or 10 times the expected worst-case scenario.Frequent crashes and authentication errors plagued the game\'s release and persisted for several days.For the first two days after launch, players were unable to access the game through their Pokémon Trainer Club accounts; only Gmail-based accounts were able to gain access to the game.Servers again suffered frequent outages in Australia on July 11; players blamed people in the United Kingdom for bypassing local servers and using Australian ones to play the game before its official release.On July 16, a few hours after the release in many European countries, the game\'s servers temporarily went down.The outage was claimed by a hacking group called ""PoodleCorp"", who said they used a DDoS attack to take them down, although the problem was fixed later that day.The next day, the servers went down again as the game was launched in Canada.John Hanke issued an apology for the server issues at San Diego Comic Con 2016, stating ""we weren\'t provisioned for what happened"".\n\nSome early iOS installs of Pokémon Go required users to provide the app with full access to their Google accounts, thereby allowing the app to ""access players\' Gmail-based email, Google Drive-based files, photos and videos stored in Google Photos, and any other content within their Google accounts"".The Pokémon Company and Niantic responded to the concerns, recognizing that the iOS app, at the time, ""... erroneously requests full access permission for the user\'s Google account ...""However, Adam Reeve—the person who initially made claims of the security issues in a Tumblr post—later backtracked on his claim and was not ""100 percent sure"" it was valid.Dan Guido, CEO of the security company Trail of Bits, analyzed the app\'s programming and discovered that although the game did request full account access, this did not enable third-party usage as initially conveyed.Guido found that this did enable Niantic to access people\'s email addresses and phone numbers unintentionally.A subsequent iOS app update reduced the scope of access.Niantic also issued a statement assuring users that no information was collected nor was any information beyond what was necessary to use the app accessed.\n\nAlongside server issues, Pokémon Go suffered from several glitches.One of the more prominent bugs appeared in mid-July 2016 and rendered the game\'s tracking feature useless.Normally, this feature shows between zero and three footprints to inform the player of how close they are to a nearby Pokémon; however, it universally became ""stuck"" at three steps, earning it the name ""three-step-glitch"".Niantic removed the footstep feature altogether on July 30, sparking criticism from players.By August 1, players reported a new glitch that swaps their captured Pokémon with another creature at random.Another bug, confirmed by Niantic in August, inadvertently made capturing Pokémon more difficult.Some legendary Pokémon, which are rare and powerful versions of the creatures, were also obtained by players in a glitch, though they were later removed from the accounts of the trainers to keep the game fair.\n\nPokémon Go released to ""mixed or average"" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.Upon release, critics called the experience enjoyable, but noted the game\'s technical issues.\n\nCritics praised various aspects of Pokémon Go.Oscar Dayus (Pocket Gamer) said that the game was an immensely enjoyable experience and continued with how ""the very personal nature of catching Pokémon in your own neighborhood made me smile more than any game has for years"".Jeremy Parish (US Gamer) compared the game and its social aspects to a massively multiplayer online game.Reviewers also praised the game enabling the promotion of physical exercise.Terri Schwartz (IGN) said it was ""secretly the best exercise app out there"" and that it changed her daily walking routine.Patrick Allen (Lifehacker) wrote an article with tips about how to work out using Pokémon Go.Julia Belluz (Vox) said it could be the ""greatest unintentional health fad ever"" and wrote that one of the results of the game that the developers may not have realized was that ""it seems to be getting people moving"".Users took an extra 194 steps per day once they started using the app, which approximated to 26% more than usual.IGN named it the 100th best video game of all time in 2018.\n\nPhilip Kollar and Allegra Frank (Polygon) both agreed that Pokémon Go was ""an exciting social experience"", but were not sure how long the game and its popularity would last, stating it could either last for coming years or ""end up as a brush fire craze that the whole gaming world is talking about for a few weeks and then is forgotten"".\n\nOther critics expressed more negative opinions of the game, with many citing frequent crashes and other technical issues, along with shallow gameplay.Kallie Plagge (IGN) said that although the game lacked in polish and depth, the overall experience made up for it.Matt Peckham (Time) criticized the game for its frequent crashes.Mike Cosimano (Destructoid) also took issue with the game, saying the original idea showed promise, but was improperly executed.Kat Brewster (The Guardian) wrote that although she thought Pokémon Go was not a good game, it was ""a great experience"".The server problems also received negative press.Miguel Concepcion (GameSpot) said that although he enjoyed the game\'s strong social appeal and visual design, the game\'s ""initial iteration is a buggy mess on all levels"", with one of the reasons being the constant server problems.Another glitch that appeared a few days after launch was the ""three-step glitch"", which made it impossible to ""hunt down a specific Pokémon"".Patricia Hernandez (Kotaku) said, ""the three step glitch adds to what has been a terrible launch for Pokémon Go"".Critics also emphasized on the large gap between the rural and urban players.Rural players seem to be at a major disadvantage when playing the game, while city players have access to more PokéStops and Gyms.\n\nPokémon Go rapidly rose the American iOS App Store\'s ""Top Grossing"" and ""Free"" charts.The game has become the fastest game to top the App Store and Google Play, beating Clash Royale, and it became the most downloaded app on the App Store of any app in their first week.Within two days of release, it was installed on more than 5% of Android devices in the United

installs and revenue is the United States, followed by Japan and Germany in revenue and by Brazil and Mexico in installs.\n\nDuring 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic causing restrictions on the ability of players to play Go outside their homes, Niantic implemented new features which allowed players to play the game from inside their homes, and this was credited with increasing its playerbase throughout the year despite the restrictions.Despite a brief drop early in the pandemic, the number of monthly active users of the game rose by 45 percent between January and August 2020, and the game\'s revenue in 2020 was the highest in its history, exceeding even its 2016 revenue.The game generated more than of revenue in the first 10 months of 2020 according to Sensor Tower, and it was the

million people engaged in 1.1 billion interactions that mentioned Pokémon Go on Facebook and Instagram in the month of July.Numerous media outlets referred to the surge in popularity as ""Pokémon Go Mania"", or simply ""Pokémania"".The massive popularity of the game resulted in several unusual positive effects.For example, the game placed players where they can help catch criminals and report crimes in progress, although it has also placed some in harm\'s way, and has even aided law enforcement\'s community relations, albeit with caveats.Businesses also benefited from the nearby presence of PokéStops (or them being PokéStops themselves) with the concomitant influx of people, and the intense exploration of communities has brought local history to the forefront.The game was also seen bringing its players to places of worship, as many Pokégyms are located there.Despite some criticism by religious leaders, this was received positively by religious groups, who saw it as reminding adherents to come and pray.Some establishments considered purchasing lures in the game to attract additional players to PokéStops on their property.Within a week of its release, a secondary market emerged for the game, both for the resell of high-level accounts on Craigslist and PlayerUp, and for the sale of expert advice on Thumbtack.Wireless provider T-Mobile US started an offer for free data for a year for Pokémon Go sessions, and Yelp added a filter that only shows businesses which have a PokéStop nearby.National parks across the United States saw an influx of visitors due to the game, with ""hundreds or thousands"" of people visiting the National Mall and Memorial Parks in Washington, D.C. on the weekend following Pokémon Go release in the country.Small museums with PokéStops placed at exhibits also reported increased attendance, such as the McNay Art Museum in San Antonio, Texas, and the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens in Boca Raton, Florida.Charity organizations also sought engagement from players, with animal shelters offering dog walks to people who want to hatch eggs.\n\nEduardo Paes, then-mayor of Rio de Janeiro, stated that he hoped the app would be released in Brazil before the start of the 2016 Summer Olympics in the city (and it was, on August 3), and United States presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton mentioned the app during their 2016 election campaigns.In late July 2016, during a public address, the President of Italy, Sergio Mattarella, compared a political issue about the date of an incoming referendum as preposterous as the hunt for the Pokémon.Shortly after the game\'s release, Bellator mixed martial artist Michael Page celebrated a knockout of his match opponent, Evangelista Santos by putting on a red Ash Ketchum-like hat and rolling a prop Poké Ball in Santos\'s direction.On July 25, Dwayne Johnson released a promo video featuring MatPat and Ali-A with himself as a tough, rare Pokémon.\n\nThe game was credited for popularizing AR, and was praised by genderfluid groups for letting the players choose a ""style"" instead of ""gender"".The game also had a positive impact among individuals with autism.The ""Pokémon Theme"" from the animated series saw a 630% increase in listeners on music streaming platform Spotify during the month of the game\'s release.Meanwhile, streaming services such as Hulu experienced an increased viewership of the Pokémon series and films.Nintendo reported that sales of the 3DS Pokémon games rose as a result of the game\'s popularity.A Twitch channel, Twitch Plays Pokémon Go, was created that mimics the crowd-played Twitch Plays Pokémon channel, allowing viewers to direct a virtual avatar in the game using an iPhone programmed to spoof its location.Niantic later issued permanent bans to those who cheated the game by means such as GPS spoofing and bots.Pokémon-themed pornography increased in popularity after the release of the game.xHamster, an adult video streaming website, reported that within 5 days of the game\'s release, Pokémon related terms were the most searched for videos.Another adult video streaming website, Pornhub, reported that Pokémon related searches spiked 136%.Pokémon Go was spoofed in the Maroon 5 music video, ""Don\'t Wanna Know"".In the 2016 Doctor Who Christmas special, ""The Return of Doctor Mysterio"", the Doctor creates a distraction by ""flood[ing] the downstairs with Pokémon"", causing the people to run off with their cell phones.In the episode ""Looking for Mr. Goodbart"" from the 28th season of The Simpsons, the people of Springfield become addicted to Peekimon Get, a parody of Pokémon Go.\n\nGos release resulted in a resurgence in popularity for the Pokémon franchise as a whole.The Pokémon Sun and Moon games for the Nintendo 3DS, released later in 2016, was the best-selling video game for the 3DS with over 16 million copies sold, and this was partly attributed to the new fans to the series brought in by Go.In an interview, director of Sun and Moon Shigeru Ohmori remarked that the Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon sequels were designed partly to facilitate entry for newcomers to the franchise brought in by Go.The first Pokémon games for the Nintendo Switch, Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee!, took significant inspirations from Go.A line of official Go merchandise was released in November 2019.\n\nIn addition to standard gameplay, the game has held several in-game and live events.The first live event officially held by Niantic was held in Charlotte, North Carolina, in May 2017.In July 2017, a community event was held in Grant Park, Chicago, in honor of the first anniversary of the game\'s release.Despite the fact that almost no information about the event, including ticket prices and attractions, was released by Niantic ahead of the ticket sale, over 20,000 tickets sold out within a half hour.During the event itself, attendees suffered connectivity issues and crashes, due to the heavy amount of localized cellular activity.Afterwards, Niantic announced that they would refund everybody who bought a ticket, as well as give them $100 of in-game currency.Following the event, around two dozen attendees filed suit against Niantic, seeking travel reimbursement.\n\nFollowing the event in Chicago, other events have been held in Chester, Yokohama, and San Jose.In September 2017, a series of events named ""Safari Zone"" was held in Unibail-Rodamco shopping centers in Oberhausen, Paris and Barcelona, with events the following month in Copenhagen, Prague, Stockholm and Amstelveen.\n\nIn January 2018, Niantic announced monthly community event Community Day which aims to get players to meet up in their local areas.During a multi-hour period, players can encounter more frequent wild spawns of a particular Pokémon, an exclusive move for that Pokémon (or its evolution), an increased probability for the shiny form of that Pokémon, and bonuses such as extra stardust or XP.The Community Days in 2018 featured Pikachu (January 20), Dratini (February 24), Bulbasaur (March 25), Mareep (April 15), Charmander (May 19), Larvitar (June 16), Squirtle (July 8), Eevee (August 11–12), Chikorita (September 22), Beldum (October 21), and Cyndaquil (November 10).\n\nPokémon Go in Syria is a photography series published in 2016 by Syrian artist Khaled Akil.Akil places Pokémon characters in destroyed Syrian streets as a reminder for a world lost behind the screen.While Pokémon Go was trending worldwide, Akil couldn\'t help but notice how the media forgot about the war in Syria, and visualised his idea in the form of digital collages.Khaled\'s Pokémon series quickly went viral across the globe after he posted it online.This photography series was exhibited in various locations including the American University Museum.\n\nThe app was criticized for using locations such as cemeteries and memorials as sites to catch Pokémon, including the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, Arlington National Cemetery, the ANZAC War Memorial, and Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.Niantic later removed content from sensitive areas such as the Hiroshima Memorial and Holocaust Museum.The game sparked complaints from Dutch company ProRail, who said that players entered their railway tracks, and fire stations told players to not impede their staff by congregating outside.\n\nThe game\'s distribution of PokéStops and gyms (derived from the portals in Ingress, Niantic\'s science fiction-themed AR game) was noted to be sparser in many minority neighborhoods in a reflection of American demographics.Players in rural areas also complained about the lack of Pokémon spawns, PokéStops, and gyms in their area.Pokémon Go was criticized for game accessibility issues by players with physical disabilities.The AbleGamers Foundation COO, Steve Spohn, said that when Pokémon Go was compared to other mobile games, it ""excludes disabled players to a significant degree"".\n\nPolice departments in various countries issued warnings, some tongue-in-cheek, regarding inattentive driving, trespassing, and being targeted by criminals due to being unaware of one\'s surroundings.In the state of New York, sex offenders are banned from playing the app while on parole.Bosnian players were warned to stay out of minefields left over from the 1990s Bosnian War.In Russia, a 21-year-old video blogger, Ruslan Sokolovsky, was arrested in September 2016 for two months after playing Pokémon Go at the Church of All Saints in Yekaterinburg, and eventually received a suspended sentence for three and a half years in prison for charges of blasphemy.\n\nPeople have suffered various injuries from accidents related to the game.In Japan, the first accident occurred within hours of the game\'s release.The first death in Japan attributed to Pokémon Go occurred in late August 2016.A distracted driver playing the game killed one woman and seriously injured another.The 39-year-old farmer did not notice the women crossing a street and struck them with his truck.The woman died of a broken neck.Japan\'s National Police Agency said it was the 79th Pokémon Go-related accident in the country.On August 11, 2016, a young girl in Cambodia was reportedly killed after being hit by a car while trying to capture a Pokémon on a road.The case was the first death related to Pokémon Go among Southeast Asian countries.In January 2017, Chinese-American civilian Jiansheng Chen was shot dead while playing Pokémon Go.\n\nAl-Azhar University in Cairo described the game as ""harmful mania.""A Cossack leader declared that it ""smacks of Satanism"", Kuwait banned the game from government sites, Indonesian officials deemed it a national security threat, and in Israel the IDF banned the game from Army bases out of security considerations.In Saudi Arabia, the General Secretariat of the Council of Senior Scholars declared, in light of a 2001 fatwa banning the Pokémon card game as a form of gambling, that the electronic app required a new ruling.This was also followed by both Indian and Malaysian Islamic leaders telling Indian and Malaysian Muslims to avoid the game.\n\nDuring Thailand\'s 2016 constitutional referendum polling, Pokémon Go players were told to refrain from entering polling stations.Thus the Thai National Broadcasting and Communications Commission intends to ask Niantic to remove Pokémon characters and PokéStops from locations such as government facilities, historic and religious sites, private property as well as dangerous spots such as narrow footpaths and rivers.Cambodia has banned the game in a former genocide site after Pokémon players showed up at the site.Vietnam has banned players from entering the government and defense offices.The Vietnamese Ministry of Information and Communications is also considering the game\'s negative impact to Vietnamese society, where many people left home at night, crossed the road or drove on the street with their eyes kept focused on phones, which brought the need to ban the game in the country.Following the move by other Southeast Asian neighbors, the Philippines also banned the game in all administration offices.According to a survey by Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF), around 4% of employers in Malaysia fired their staff for playing the game during working hours.\n\nRussia also voiced their concerns over the application, with Nikolay Nikiforov, the country\'s Minister of Communications and Mass Media, suspecting foreign intelligence agencies using the application to collect information, while some fundamentalist religious groups in the region claim it to be demonic.The Supreme Council of Virtual Space in Iran officially banned the game in August 2016 over security concerns.The same month, The Pentagon facility in U.S. restricted the use of the game on their property, citing security risks by collecting secret information.In the United Kingdom, 290 police incidents were reported to have occurred in July 2016 in the country due to the game.In September 2016, Niantic stopped supporting the CyanogenMod mobile operating system.This prevented users playing on CyanogenMod from playing the game from that point forward.\n\nIn India, the Gujarat High Court issued a notice to Niantic, the developer of the popular AR-based game, on the grounds of ""posing danger to public safety"".The notice was issued on a PIL (Public Interest Litigation) seeking a ban on the location-based AR reality game in India.In addition, a second PIL was filed against the developers of Pokémon Go for hurting religious sentiments by showing images of eggs in places of worship of different religious groups.But the Indian Government refused to ban the game.\n\nPokémon Gos targeted local advertising has been described by Shoshana Zuboff in The Age of Surveillance Capitalism as an experiment that initiated from Google to move targeted advertising from the digital domain (cost per click) into the physical domain (cost per visit) by the use of sponsored locations.""In the end we recognize that the probe was designed to explore the next frontier: the means of behavioral modification.The game about the game is, in fact, an experimental facsimile of surveillance capitalism\'s design for our future.""\n\nMultiple unofficial, third-party apps were created to correspond with Pokémon Go.Notable apps include ""Poké Radar"" and ""Helper for Pokémon Go"", where players can crowdsource much of the Pokémon that can be found in the game at a particular time.At its peak of popularity, ""Poké Radar"" hit #2 on the Apple App Store, behind Pokémon Go itself.\n\nAnother app, GoChat, which allows players to leave messages for other players at specific locations, accrued more than 1 million downloads in five days and reached the top 10 in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.However, the app\'s developer Jonathan Zarra chose to leave the app unmonetized and had financial trouble keeping the app\'s servers online until bringing on angel investor and board member Michael Robertson.After acquiring significant funding, the app reached over 2 million active users.According to RiskIQ, at least 215 fake versions of the game were available by July 17, 2016.Several of these fake apps contained malicious programming and viruses.\n\nLaunched on July 22, 2016, ""Pokévision"" enabled players to find exactly where Pokémon spawned and how much time was left until they despawned; the site used data hacked directly from the game.In the five days following the website\'s launch, 27 million unique visitors used the site.On July 31, multiple search apps and sites, including Pokévision, were disabled as they violated Niantic\'s terms of service.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Niantic responded by implementing changes and new features in the game which allowed players to easily play remotely.However, starting on August 1, 2021, Niantic began rolling back these changes as part of their Exploration Bonus Updates.Players in New Zealand and the United States were the first to receive the post-pandemic changes, and gradually, they were rolled out to the rest of the world ""in accordance with recommendations from global health organizations.""In fear of violations in health and personal safety regulations, as well as negatively impacting players with disabilities, the company has since received heavy criticism from the player base (including top players Brandon Tan and Nick Oyzon) due to their reverting safety measures implemented during the pandemic, in which gym and Pokéstop interaction distances were increased from 40 to 80 metres.Despite increasing rates of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in various U.S. states (resulting in overflowing hospitals), Niantic are firm on not keeping the pandemic bonuses.Players began boycotting Pokémon Go since in first week of August 2021.\n\nOn Twitter, the #HearUsNiantic started trending worldwide as fans and players voiced their censure towards Niantic\'s decision to remove the pandemic bonuses.A letter was sent to Niantic, which responded to the community by stating that the pandemic changes will not stay.As Niantic are an AR company, part of their business strategy is to sell user data by players after completing AR Mapping tasks where they can log their surroundings at marked PokéStops in their in-game maps.The reduced distance means an increased potential for Niantic to generate more revenue.Another reason for their changes is for Niantic to preserve their image of being an AR tech giant; on their blog post they stated that it is their ""mission"" to ""encourage outdoor exploration"" and ""to connect [people] to real places in the real world, and to visit places that are worth exploring.""Players have also speculated that Niantic is rolling back the pandemic bonuses to send players closer to sponsored businesses such as McDonald\'s (marked by a PokéStop or gym), from which Niantic has made a lot of money.\n\nList of

59,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Pokémon Go', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'Pokémon Go (stylized as Pokémon GO) is a 2016 augmented reality (AR) mobile game, part of the Pokémon franchise, developed and published by Niantic in collaboration with Nintendo and The Pokémon Company for iOS and Android devices.It uses mobile devices with GPS to locate, capture, train, and battle virtual Pokémon, which appear as if they are in the player\'s real-world location.The game is free-to-play; it uses a freemium business model combined with local advertising and supports in-app purchases for additional in-game items.The game launched with around 150 species of Pokémon, which had increased to around 700 by 2021.\n\nPokémon Go was released to mixed reviews; critics praised the concept but criticized technical problems.It was one of the most used and profitable mobile apps in 2016, having been downloaded more than 500 million times worldwide by the end of the year.It is credited with popularizing location-based and AR technology, promoting physical activity, and helping local businesses grow due to escalated foot traffic.However, it attracted controversy for contributing to accidents and creating public nuisances.Various governments expressed concerns about security, and some countries regulate its use.The game had over monthly active users by May 2018, over a billion global downloads by early 2019, and grossed more than in revenue by 2020.\n\nAfter establishing a game account, players create and customize their own avatars.Once created, an avatar is displayed on a map based on the player\'s geographical location.Features on the map include \'PokéStops\' and \'Pokémon Gyms\'.These PokéStops can be equipped with items called \'Lure Modules\', which attract additional wild, and occasionally rare, Pokémon.Gyms serve as battle locations for team-based king of the hill matches.PokéStops and Gyms are typically located at places of interest.These locations were initially re-purposed portals from Ingress, Niantic\'s previous augmented reality (AR) game.This has led to PokéStops and Pokémon Gyms being placed at dangerous or inconvenient locations, such as a now-deleted Gym at the Korean Demilitarized Zone and Bagram Airforce Base, which was abandoned by U.S. forces in July 2021.Since 2019, these locations also include submissions from Go players which are largely reviewed by other players.\n\nAs players move within their real world surroundings, their avatars move within the game\'s map.Different Pokémon species reside in different areas of the world; for example, Water-type Pokémon are generally found near water.When a player encounters a Pokémon, it may be viewed either in AR mode or with a live rendered, generic background.AR mode uses the camera and gyroscope on the player\'s mobile device to display an image of a Pokémon as though it were in the real world.Players can take screenshots of the Pokémon they encounter either with or without the AR mode activated.\n\nAlthough the game is free to play, it supports in-app purchases, where players can purchase additional Poké Balls and other in-game items.These items include Incense, which attracts Pokémon to the player as they move for sixty minutes, Lure Modules, which players use at PokéStops to attract Pokémon to their current location near the PokeStop, and Lucky Eggs, which double experience points gained for a thirty-minute period from use.All Pokémon are displayed with a Combat Power, which is a rough measure of how powerful that Pokémon is in battle.Generally, as players level up, they catch Pokémon with higher CP and Pokémon are somewhat harder to catch.The player can check how strong their Pokémon are by the ""Appraisal"" system.\n\nPlayers can customize their avatar\'s appearance with clothing options that differ in availability according to season, player level, and game sponsors.Clothing includes: hats, accessories, tops, bottoms, socks, footwear and bags.Most clothing aligns with either the look of a specific Pokémon, a specific team and/or Pokémon region.Many pieces of clothing are free, but pieces can also be purchased using coins, earned during select events, awarded as the player levels up, or received as a prize for special research completion.\n\nAnother way for a player to customize their avatar is with a pose.Poses, like clothing, are free, purchased, or awarded.Certain poses are event based and can only be earned during the event they are attached to.Once the event is over, there is no guarantee that the pose will be available in-game again.\n\nIn April 2024, Pokémon GO was updated to allow greater customization of player avatars.Customization now includes a limited number of different hair styles, the ability to adjust the weight of the avatar, and expanded options for skin color.This update was met with mass backlash from the playerbase, as the new avatars were perceived to be of inferior graphical quality in comparison to the outgoing models, and because the updated models interfered with some pre-update cosmetic items, of which many had been purchased by players.\n\nUnlike most other installments in the Pokémon series, players in Pokémon Go do not battle wild Pokémon to catch them.During an encounter with a wild Pokémon, a player may throw a Poké Ball at it by flicking it from the bottom of the screen up toward the Pokémon.If the Pokémon is caught, it will come under the ownership of the player.Factors in the success rate of catching a Pokémon include the Pokémon\'s catch rate, the timing, the type of Poké Ball used, etc.After catching a wild Pokémon, the player is awarded two types of in-game currencies: Candies and Stardust.The Candies awarded by a successful catch depend on what evolutionary chain a Pokémon belongs to.A player can use Stardust and Candies to raise a Pokémon\'s level and hence ""Combat Power"" (CP).However, only Candies are needed to evolve a Pokémon, except for certain Pokémon that might need special items.Each Pokémon evolution tree has its own type of Candy, which can only be used to evolve or level up.The maximum level a player can achieve was originally level 40, but expanded to 50 as of November 30, 2020.The player can also transfer the Pokémon back to the Pokémon Professor Willow to earn more Candies and create room for more Pokémon.Shiny Pokémon are available through multiple ways, mostly by chance.One popular goal of the game is to complete the entries in the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon logbook, by catching and evolving them to collect every one in it.\n\nIn September 2016, Niantic introduced a ""Buddy Pokémon"" feature, which allows players to pick a Pokémon to appear alongside them on the profile screen, and receive in-game rewards and bonuses based on the chosen Pokémon.The feature was released later that month.Certain Pokémon have different distances that they need to be walked in order to receive candy.The more the player walks in real time, the more candy they can earn.During the same update, Niantic made it impossible for players with rooted or jailbroken devices to log into the game in an effort to reduce and prevent cheating.\n\nOn January 20, 2018, Pokémon Go held the first Community Day, a monthly event that increases the appearance rate of a specific Pokémon and offer an exclusive move to the final evolution of the featured Pokémon only if caught or evolved during the event window.Players also have a higher chance to catch the Shiny variant of the featured Pokémon.The first Community Day featured Pikachu, with the exclusive move Surf to Raichu.\n\nThe game is regularly updated with new Pokémon, and as of March 25, 2022, there are just over 730 Pokémon in the game (not including regional varieties) out of a total 1008.\n\nRegional Pokémon are often released together, such as Hoenn region Pokémon released in December 2017, Alolan variants in May 2018, Sinnoh region Pokémon(along with the Sinnoh Stone item used to evolve them) released in October 2018, Unova region Pokémon (and the Unova Stone) in September 2019, Kalos region Pokémon in December 2020, and again more Alola region Pokémon in March 2022.\n\nMythical and legendary Pokémon are often released individually (or in pairs/trios) in special events or quests.The first Legendary Pokémon released was Groudon, in December 2017.The Mythical Pokémon Meltan and its evolved form, Melmetal are so far the only Pokémon to have made their debut on Pokémon Go.Their release coincided with the release of Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee!on the Nintendo Switch, Pokémon Go introduced the new Mythical Pokémon Meltan originally as a teaser, later to be available to capture only in Pokémon Go via a ""Mystery Box"" item that could be obtained through transferring Pokémon from Pokémon Go to either Nintendo Switch Pokémon games, or by completing new Research Tasks.\n\nIn August 2020, Mega Evolution came to Pokémon Go with four Pokémon able to Mega Evolve into five forms.\n\nPlayers earn experience points for various in-game activities.Players rise in level as they earn experience points (XP), with various features being progressively unlocked.Most-notably, at level five, the player can battle at a Pokémon Gym and join one of three color-coded teams (red for Team Valor, blue for Team Mystic, or yellow for Team Instinct), which act as factions battling for control of Gyms within the Pokémon Go world.\n\nIn June 2017, Niantic announced that the game mechanics of Gyms would be revamped for a more teamwork-oriented experience; Gyms were disabled on June 19, 2017, with the new Gyms being released with the next app update a few days later.As of the update, Gyms included a spinnable component to receive in-game items such as Potions and Poké Balls.Additionally, Gyms are capped at containing six Pokémon, each of which must be unique in that Gym.Coins are now earned based on the amount of time the defending Pokémon has been in a Gym, as opposed to a one-per-day gym defender bonus of 10 coins per current defending Pokémon.Legendary, Mythical and Buddy Pokémon cannot be placed in Gyms.\n\nIn July 2017, Raid Battles were introduced.Raid Battles consist of a group of players gathering to confront an over-leveled Pokémon located in a Gym.If the Pokémon is defeated, the players gain the chance to catch a regular version of it.Raid difficulties range from 1 to 5, with 1 being of the lowest difficulty, and 5 being the most difficult to defeat.Level 5 raids are exclusive to Legendary Pokémon.The first of these, Articuno and Lugia, were released on July 22, 2017, after the Go Fest, with Moltres and Zapdos following.From September to November, the 3 Legendary Beasts: Entei, Raikou and Suicune, were released shortly after, rotating regions every month.Following their departure, the Legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh appeared in Raid Battles from November 27, 2017, to December 12, 2017.In August 2020, level 3 Mega raids arrived with the introduction of Mega Evolution.At the same time, Level 2 and 4 raids were combined into Level 1 and 3 raids.\n\nIn May 2022, Raid Battle were updated to include the addition of Mega Legendary Pokémon, which were turned to 6 stars, the highest currently in the game.The only Pokémon included in these Raids were Mega Latios and Mega Latias.\n\nIn October 2022, a new form of raid battle called ""Elite Raids"" were introduced.Elite Raids differ to normal raids in a number of ways, most notably that they can only be battled in person, take 24 hours to start, and are extremely difficult, often requiring a large number of players to defeat the Pokémon.\n\nIn May 2023, another new form of raid battles were introduced called ""Shadow Raids"".Shadow Raids may only be battled in person and award the chance to catch a Shadow Pokémon upon defeat.During the battle, the Pokémon may become ""enraged"", increasing both attack and defence, but can be returned to normal using a ""Purified Gem"".\n\nIn December 2018, Niantic added player vs player Trainer Battles.In January 2020, Niantic rolled out an online battle format Go Battle League which allows players to fight other players worldwide.Unlike the Trainer Battles format introduced in 2018, Go Battle League does not require physical proximity, scanning QR code on each other\'s phone, knowing each other\'s friend code, or any other real-world interactions between players.Instead, participating players are automatically paired by the game server via some variant of the Elo rating system.\n\nIn July 2019, Pokémon Go introduced Team GO Rocket battles.Team GO Rocket NPCs could be battled at PokéStops indicated with it twitching and being a dark color or in Team GO Rocket Balloons which follow the player on the map.After victory, the player has the opportunity to capture a ""Shadow Pokémon"" which are relatively low-leveled, angry-looking Pokémon.Shadow Pokémon have a higher attack stat but a lower defense stat than a normal Pokémon.After capture, the player can choose to purify the Shadow Pokémon.Purified Pokémon are higher-leveled than their Shadow counterparts, can learn an exclusive move when purified, and need fewer candies to evolve.\n\nThe concept for the game was conceived in 2014 by Satoru Iwata of Nintendo and Tsunekazu Ishihara of The Pokémon Company as an April Fools\' Day collaboration with Google, called the Google Maps: Pokémon Challenge.Ishihara was a fan of developer Niantic\'s previous transreality game, Ingress, and saw the game\'s concept as a perfect match for the Pokémon series.Niantic, a subsidiary of Google, used the crowdsourced data from Ingress to populate the locations for PokéStops and gyms within Pokémon Go, data from Google Maps to spawn specific Pokémon on certain terrain, and map display from OpenStreetMap since December 2017.The game\'s application logic uses the open source Kubernetes system - and due to the game\'s sheer scale of users, a number of bugs with the Kubernetes system was discovered and later fixed.Niantic was spun off from Google as an independent company in 2015 following the company reorganization into Alphabet Inc.\n\nIn 2015, Ishihara dedicated his speech at the game\'s announcement on September 10 to Iwata, who had died two months earlier.Tatsuo Nomura, who joined Niantic in 2015 after he developed the Google Maps Pokémon Challenge, acted as Director and Product Manager for the game.The game\'s soundtrack was written by longtime Pokémon series composer, Junichi Masuda, who also assisted with some of the game\'s design.Among the game\'s graphic designers was Dennis Hwang, who previously created the logo of Gmail while working for Google.\n\nOn March 4, 2016, Niantic announced a Japan-exclusive beta test would begin later that month, allowing players to assist in refining the game before its full release.The beta test was later expanded to other countries.On April 7, it was announced that the beta would expand to Australia and New Zealand.Then, on May 16, the signups for the field test were opened to the United States.The test came to an end on June 30.\n\nAt the Comic-Con 2016, John Hanke, founder of Niantic, revealed the appearances of the three team leaders: Candela (Team Valor), Blanche (Team Mystic), and Spark (Team Instinct).Hanke conveyed that approximately 10% of the ideas for the game were implemented.Future updates, including the addition of trading, more Pokémon, implementation of Pokémon Centers at PokéStops, a patch for the ""three step glitch"", and easier training, were also confirmed.He also stated that Niantic would be continuing support for the game for ""years to come"".In an interview with TechCrunch in September 2016, Hanke hinted that player vs. player Pokémon battles would be released in a future update.In December 2016, coffeehouse chain Starbucks and telecommunications company Sprint collaborated with Nintendo to add PokéStops and gyms at certain locations of theirs throughout the United States.That same month, a companion app for Apple Watch devices was released, which allows users to receive notifications about nearby Pokémon, but does not allow for them to be caught.In January 2017, an additional 5,000 more Starbucks locations became available as gyms.In February 2017, an update was released which introduced over 100 species based in the Johto region from the second generation of the core Pokémon series, which were added alongside the original 151.The update also included the addition of new berries, new Pokémon encounter mechanics, and an expanded selection of avatar clothing options.Some of the Pokémon introduced in Ruby and Sapphire were added in late 2017, starting with a Halloween event in October and 50 more in December.A weather system was added alongside the latter, allowing real-world weather to affect gameplay.In November 2018, a game developed by Game Freak and heavily inspired by Pokémon Go, Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee! was released on the Nintendo Switch.This game will feature Pokémon Go style catching with Joy-Con and there has integration between the two games.In addition, new Pokémon Meltan was revealed in September, becoming the first new Pokémon to be released through Pokémon Go.On October 10, 2018, The Pokémon Company and Niantic announced plans to introduce Pokémon from Diamond and Pearl into Pokémon Go.On October 12, Niantic teased one of the Generation IV Pokémon that would be coming to Pokémon Go.On October 25, a feature known as Adventure Sync was announced, which will record the player\'s walking data in the background.On October 26, Niantic announced research tasks for Bug type Pokémon that will give players a chance to catch Shedinja throughout November.\n\nAccording to John Hanke in a January 2019 interview with Business Insider, 2018 saw Go become the game initially envisioned by Niantic.\n\nIn 2020, Niantic made major changes to gameplay mechanisms to account for the COVID-19 pandemic which saw many players unable to leave their homes to play.These development shift saw changes like the addition of indoor step tracking to count toward in-game distance challenges, long distance PVP battles, increased ""incense"" effectiveness, increased spawn points, and a doubled player radius.\n\nThe Pokémon Go Plus is a Bluetooth Low Energy wearable device, developed by Nintendo\'s Platform Technology Development division, that allows players to perform certain actions in the game without looking at their smart device.When a player is near a Pokémon or PokéStop, the Plus vibrates.The player can then press the button to capture the Pokémon or receive items from the PokéStop; the player cannot check what they have received until the next time they sign into the app onto their mobile device.The design consists of a Poké Ball and the shape of the Google Maps pin.The decision to create the device rather than create a smartwatch app was to increase uptake among players for whom a smartwatch is prohibitively expensive.It was released in the United Kingdom and North America on September 16, 2016.\n\nThe game\'s official launch began on July 6, 2016, with releases in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.Due to server strain from high demand upon release, Niantic CEO John Hanke stated that the release in other regions was to be ""paused until Niantic was comfortable"" fixing the issues.European releases started on July 13, and the game became available to most of the continent over the following ten days.The Japanese launch was initially reported to be on July 20; however, the game was delayed after a sponsorship deal with fast food chain McDonald\'s was leaked, instead releasing two days later.Although the game was proposed to be released in France on July 15, it was postponed until July 24 out of respect and due to safety concerns following a terrorist attack in Nice on July 14.Following the shut down of third-party apps and websites in late-July 2016—significantly reducing server strain—Niantic was able to continue pushing release worldwide.Central and South America and most of Southeast Asia subsequently saw releases in early August.Indonesia was the first Asian country to have the game playable, despite the game not being officially released in that region until August 6.\n\nIn South Korea, the game was not officially released as major restrictions on the use of online mapping data exist.However, due to a glitch, a small area around Sokcho in the northeastern part of the country was considered a part of Niantic\'s North Korea mapping region, making the game fully playable in that area.Numerous people took advantage of the gap to play the game.Bus tickets from the capital city of Seoul sold out and people living within Sokcho shared information on free Wi-Fi areas to tourists.Players also discovered a gym in Panmunjom, along the Korean Demilitarized Zone; however, Niantic later removed it from the game.Following the release of Pokémon Go in Japan, parts of Busan also became playable as parts of the city are considered part of Japan\'s mapping area due to the proximity of Tsushima Island.The game officially released in the country in January 2017.\n\nIn mainland China, Google services are banned by the Great Firewall, whereas the GPS function in the game is blocked by Niantic.Players of Pokémon Go in China have to download the game with App Store IDs from other regions and use VPN to access Google services in order to load the game, and some even use a GPS spoofing app to bypass the GPS blocking.Some players also downloaded a clone app called City Spirit Go, which was released shortly after Pokémon Go beta test in Japan.As of 2020, the official game is still unplayable in most parts of China with GPS modules being blocked in-game.\n\nDuring its launch in Southeast Asia in August 2016, the game officially excluded Myanmar, but users in Thailand discovered that the game was fully playable in border cities near the nation.The game was released in the Balkans, Macau, and Central Asia in September 2016, and was also released throughout Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia by the end of the year.\n\nOn September 11, 2018, the game appeared in Russia\'s App Store and Google Play Store over two years after the first launch.However, Niantic did not officially announce the release.\n\nIn May 2019, the game was released on the Samsung Galaxy Store.\n\nInvestors were buoyed by the response to the initial release of Pokémon Go on July 7, with Nintendo\'s share price rising by an initial 10% and by July 14 shares rose to as high as 50%.Despite Nintendo only owning a 32% stake in The Pokémon Company and an undisclosed stake in Niantic, Nintendo\'s market value increased by US$9 billion within five days of release of Pokémon Go.The trend continued for more than a week after the game\'s release and by July 19, the stock value of Nintendo more than doubled as compared to pre-release.Turnover sales reached a record-breaking ¥703.6 billion (US$6.6 billion); and trading of the stock accounted for a quarter of all trades on the Tokyo Stock Exchange\'s main board.The Financial Times believed that investors were speculating not on Pokémon Go as such, but on future Nintendo app releases being as successful as the company moves more into the mobile app market—an area they were historically reluctant to enter in the belief it would cannibalise its portable console and video game sales.Nintendo plans to release four more smartphone app games by March 2017, and investors remarked that Pokémon Go showed Nintendo still has some of the ""most valuable character intellectual property in the world"" with franchises such as Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid.\n\nBy July 22, Nintendo gained ¥1.8 trillion ($17.6 billion) in market capitalization since the game\'s launch.However, following clarification from Nintendo that the company did not produce Pokémon Go nor had tangible financial gains from it, its stock fell by 18%—equating to a ¥708 billion ($6.7 billion) loss in market value—on July 25.This was the largest single-day decline for Nintendo since 1990 and the maximum one-day exchange of finances allowed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.The company has an approximate 13% ""effective economic stake"" in the game, according to Macquarie Securities.\n\nThe surge in stocks extended beyond Nintendo, with Tomy, TV Tokyo, and the Bank of Kyoto, among other companies, all seeing significant gains.Similarly, Zagg, which owns a company that manufactures battery cases, saw a 25% rise in its stock in relation to Pokémon Go.\n\nAt launch, the game suffered from frequent server outages due to extreme usage.The global server usage expectation for the game was surpassed within 15 minutes of the game\'s release in Australia and New Zealand, and peaked at 50 times expected traffic, or 10 times the expected worst-case scenario.Frequent crashes and authentication errors plagued the game\'s release and persisted for several days.For the first two days after launch, players were unable to access the game through their Pokémon Trainer Club accounts; only Gmail-based accounts were able to gain access to the game.Servers again suffered frequent outages in Australia on July 11; players blamed people in the United Kingdom for bypassing local servers and using Australian ones to play the game before its official release.On July 16, a few hours after the release in many European countries, the game\'s servers temporarily went down.The outage was claimed by a hacking group called ""PoodleCorp"", who said they used a DDoS attack to take them down, although the problem was fixed later that day.The next day, the servers went down again as the game was launched in Canada.John Hanke issued an apology for the server issues at San Diego Comic Con 2016, stating ""we weren\'t provisioned for what happened"".\n\nSome early iOS installs of Pokémon Go required users to provide the app with full access to their Google accounts, thereby allowing the app to ""access players\' Gmail-based email, Google Drive-based files, photos and videos stored in Google Photos, and any other content within their Google accounts"".The Pokémon Company and Niantic responded to the concerns, recognizing that the iOS app, at the time, ""... erroneously requests full access permission for the user\'s Google account ...""However, Adam Reeve—the person who initially made claims of the security issues in a Tumblr post—later backtracked on his claim and was not ""100 percent sure"" it was valid.Dan Guido, CEO of the security company Trail of Bits, analyzed the app\'s programming and discovered that although the game did request full account access, this did not enable third-party usage as initially conveyed.Guido found that this did enable Niantic to access people\'s email addresses and phone numbers unintentionally.A subsequent iOS app update reduced the scope of access.Niantic also issued a statement assuring users that no information was collected nor was any information beyond what was necessary to use the app accessed.\n\nAlongside server issues, Pokémon Go suffered from several glitches.One of the more prominent bugs appeared in mid-July 2016 and rendered the game\'s tracking feature useless.Normally, this feature shows between zero and three footprints to inform the player of how close they are to a nearby Pokémon; however, it universally became ""stuck"" at three steps, earning it the name ""three-step-glitch"".Niantic removed the footstep feature altogether on July 30, sparking criticism from players.By August 1, players reported a new glitch that swaps their captured Pokémon with another creature at random.Another bug, confirmed by Niantic in August, inadvertently made capturing Pokémon more difficult.Some legendary Pokémon, which are rare and powerful versions of the creatures, were also obtained by players in a glitch, though they were later removed from the accounts of the trainers to keep the game fair.\n\nPokémon Go released to ""mixed or average"" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.Upon release, critics called the experience enjoyable, but noted the game\'s technical issues.\n\nCritics praised various aspects of Pokémon Go.Oscar Dayus (Pocket Gamer) said that the game was an immensely enjoyable experience and continued with how ""the very personal nature of catching Pokémon in your own neighborhood made me smile more than any game has for years"".Jeremy Parish (US Gamer) compared the game and its social aspects to a massively multiplayer online game.Reviewers also praised the game enabling the promotion of physical exercise.Terri Schwartz (IGN) said it was ""secretly the best exercise app out there"" and that it changed her daily walking routine.Patrick Allen (Lifehacker) wrote an article with tips about how to work out using Pokémon Go.Julia Belluz (Vox) said it could be the ""greatest unintentional health fad ever"" and wrote that one of the results of the game that the developers may not have realized was that ""it seems to be getting people moving"".Users took an extra 194 steps per day once they started using the app, which approximated to 26% more than usual.IGN named it the 100th best video game of all time in 2018.\n\nPhilip Kollar and Allegra Frank (Polygon) both agreed that Pokémon Go was ""an exciting social experience"", but were not sure how long the game and its popularity would last, stating it could either last for coming years or ""end up as a brush fire craze that the whole gaming world is talking about for a few weeks and then is forgotten"".\n\nOther critics expressed more negative opinions of the game, with many citing frequent crashes and other technical issues, along with shallow gameplay.Kallie Plagge (IGN) said that although the game lacked in polish and depth, the overall experience made up for it.Matt Peckham (Time) criticized the game for its frequent crashes.Mike Cosimano (Destructoid) also took issue with the game, saying the original idea showed promise, but was improperly executed.Kat Brewster (The Guardian) wrote that although she thought Pokémon Go was not a good game, it was ""a great experience"".The server problems also received negative press.Miguel Concepcion (GameSpot) said that although he enjoyed the game\'s strong social appeal and visual design, the game\'s ""initial iteration is a buggy mess on all levels"", with one of the reasons being the constant server problems.Another glitch that appeared a few days after launch was the ""three-step glitch"", which made it impossible to ""hunt down a specific Pokémon"".Patricia Hernandez (Kotaku) said, ""the three step glitch adds to what has been a terrible launch for Pokémon Go"".Critics also emphasized on the large gap between the rural and urban players.Rural players seem to be at a major disadvantage when playing the game, while city players have access to more PokéStops and Gyms.\n\nPokémon Go rapidly rose the American iOS App Store\'s ""Top Grossing"" and ""Free"" charts.The game has become the fastest game to top the App Store and Google Play, beating

Niantic released a Halloween-themed event, which saw a surge in revenue up to 133% as reported by Sensor Tower, placing the game back to top of the charts of highest grossing apps.It was reported that

analyst firm Sensor Tower estimated the game had grossed over from in-app purchases, reporting that players around the world continue to spend each day.SuperData Research reported that, in May 2018, Pokémon Go grossed in monthly revenue and had monthly active players, its highest since Summer 2016.In July 2018, Pokémon Go was the top-grossing mobile app of the month.Since the introduction of

installs and revenue is the United States, followed by Japan and Germany in revenue and by Brazil and Mexico in installs.\n\nDuring 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic causing restrictions on the ability of players to play Go outside their homes, Niantic implemented new features which allowed players to play the game from inside their homes, and this was credited with increasing its playerbase throughout the year despite the restrictions.Despite a brief drop early in the pandemic, the number of monthly active users of the game rose by 45 percent between January and August 2020, and the game\'s revenue in 2020 was the highest in its history, exceeding even its 2016 revenue.The game generated more than of revenue in the first 10 months of 2020 according to Sensor Tower, and it was the top-grossing mobile game of December 2020.Pokémon Go was one of the top five highest-grossing games of 2020 with an annual revenue of according to SuperData Research, bringing the game\'s cumulative revenue to by 2020.The game generated a further in the first half of 2021.\n\nThe game was referred to as a ""social media phenomenon"" which has brought people together from all walks of life.231 million people engaged in 1.1 billion interactions that mentioned Pokémon Go on Facebook and Instagram in the month of July.Numerous media outlets referred to the surge in popularity as ""Pokémon Go Mania"", or simply ""Pokémania"".The massive popularity of the game resulted in several unusual positive effects.For example, the game placed players where they can help catch criminals and report crimes in progress, although it has also placed some in harm\'s way, and has even aided law enforcement\'s community relations, albeit with caveats.Businesses also benefited from the nearby presence of PokéStops (or them being PokéStops themselves) with the concomitant influx of people, and the intense exploration of communities has brought local history to the forefront.The game was also seen bringing its players to places of worship, as many Pokégyms are located there.Despite some criticism by religious leaders, this was received positively by religious groups, who saw it as reminding adherents to come and pray.Some establishments considered purchasing lures in the game to attract additional players to PokéStops on their property.Within a week of its release, a secondary market emerged for the game, both for the resell of high-level accounts on Craigslist and PlayerUp, and for the sale of expert advice on Thumbtack.Wireless provider T-Mobile US started an offer for free data for a year for Pokémon Go sessions, and Yelp added a filter that only shows businesses which have a PokéStop nearby.National parks across the United States saw an influx of visitors due to the game, with ""hundreds or thousands"" of people visiting the National Mall and Memorial Parks in Washington, D.C. on the weekend following Pokémon Go release in the country.Small museums with PokéStops placed at exhibits also reported increased attendance, such as the McNay Art Museum in San Antonio, Texas, and the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens in Boca Raton, Florida.Charity organizations also sought engagement from players, with animal shelters offering dog walks to people who want to hatch eggs.\n\nEduardo Paes, then-mayor of Rio de Janeiro, stated that he hoped the app would be released in Brazil before the start of the 2016 Summer Olympics in the city (and it was, on August 3), and United States presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton mentioned the app during their 2016 election campaigns.In late July 2016, during a public address, the President of Italy, Sergio Mattarella, compared a political issue about the date of an incoming referendum as preposterous as the hunt for the Pokémon.Shortly after the game\'s release, Bellator mixed martial artist Michael Page celebrated a knockout of his match opponent, Evangelista Santos by putting on a red Ash Ketchum-like hat and rolling a prop Poké Ball in Santos\'s direction.On July 25, Dwayne Johnson released a promo video featuring MatPat and Ali-A with himself as a tough, rare Pokémon.\n\nThe game was credited for popularizing AR, and was praised by genderfluid groups for letting the players choose a ""style"" instead of ""gender"".The game also had a positive impact among individuals with autism.The ""Pokémon Theme"" from the animated series saw a 630% increase in listeners on music streaming platform Spotify during the month of the game\'s release.Meanwhile, streaming services such as Hulu experienced an increased viewership of the Pokémon series and films.Nintendo reported that sales of the 3DS Pokémon games rose as a result of the game\'s popularity.A Twitch channel, Twitch Plays Pokémon Go, was created that mimics the crowd-played Twitch Plays Pokémon channel, allowing viewers to direct a virtual avatar in the game using an iPhone programmed to spoof its location.Niantic later issued permanent bans to those who cheated the game by means such as GPS spoofing and bots.Pokémon-themed pornography increased in popularity after the release of the game.xHamster, an adult video streaming website, reported that within 5 days of the game\'s release, Pokémon related terms were the most searched for videos.Another adult video streaming website, Pornhub, reported that Pokémon related searches spiked 136%.Pokémon Go was spoofed in the Maroon 5 music video, ""Don\'t Wanna Know"".In the 2016 Doctor Who Christmas special, ""The Return of Doctor Mysterio"", the Doctor creates a distraction by ""flood[ing] the downstairs with Pokémon"", causing the people to run off with their cell phones.In the episode ""Looking for Mr. Goodbart"" from the 28th season of The Simpsons, the people of Springfield become addicted to Peekimon Get, a parody of Pokémon Go.\n\nGos release resulted in a resurgence in popularity for the Pokémon franchise as a whole.The Pokémon Sun and Moon games for the Nintendo 3DS, released later in 2016, was the best-selling video game for the 3DS with over 16 million copies sold, and this was partly attributed to the new fans to the series brought in by Go.In an interview, director of Sun and Moon Shigeru Ohmori remarked that the Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon sequels were designed partly to facilitate entry for newcomers to the franchise brought in by Go.The first Pokémon games for the Nintendo Switch, Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee!, took significant inspirations from Go.A line of official Go merchandise was released in November 2019.\n\nIn addition to standard gameplay, the game has held several in-game and live events.The first live event officially held by Niantic was held in Charlotte, North Carolina, in May 2017.In July 2017, a community event was held in Grant Park, Chicago, in honor of the first anniversary of the game\'s release.Despite the fact that almost no information about the event, including ticket prices and attractions, was released by Niantic ahead of the ticket sale, over 20,000 tickets sold out within a half hour.During the event itself, attendees suffered connectivity issues and crashes, due to the heavy amount of localized cellular activity.Afterwards, Niantic announced that they would refund everybody who bought a ticket, as well as give them $100 of in-game currency.Following the event, around two dozen attendees filed suit against Niantic, seeking travel reimbursement.\n\nFollowing the event in Chicago, other events have been held in Chester, Yokohama, and San Jose.In September 2017, a series of events named ""Safari Zone"" was held in Unibail-Rodamco shopping centers in Oberhausen, Paris and Barcelona, with events the following month in Copenhagen, Prague, Stockholm and Amstelveen.\n\nIn January 2018, Niantic announced monthly community event Community Day which aims to get players to meet up in their local areas.During a multi-hour period, players can encounter more frequent wild spawns of a particular Pokémon, an exclusive move for that Pokémon (or its evolution), an increased probability for the shiny form of that Pokémon, and bonuses such as extra stardust or XP.The Community Days in 2018 featured Pikachu (January 20), Dratini (February 24), Bulbasaur (March 25), Mareep (April 15), Charmander (May 19), Larvitar (June 16), Squirtle (July 8), Eevee (August 11–12), Chikorita (September 22), Beldum (October 21), and Cyndaquil (November 10).\n\nPokémon Go in Syria is a photography series published in 2016 by Syrian artist Khaled Akil.Akil places Pokémon characters in destroyed Syrian streets as a reminder for a world lost behind the screen.While Pokémon Go was trending worldwide, Akil couldn\'t help but notice how the media forgot about the war in Syria, and visualised his idea in the form of digital collages.Khaled\'s Pokémon series quickly went viral across the globe after he posted it online.This photography series was exhibited in various locations including the American University Museum.\n\nThe app was criticized for using locations such as cemeteries and memorials as sites to catch Pokémon, including the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, Arlington National Cemetery, the ANZAC War Memorial, and Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.Niantic later removed content from sensitive areas such as the Hiroshima Memorial and Holocaust Museum.The game sparked complaints from Dutch company ProRail, who said that players entered their railway tracks, and fire stations told players to not impede their staff by congregating outside.\n\nThe game\'s distribution of PokéStops and gyms (derived from the portals in Ingress, Niantic\'s science fiction-themed AR game) was noted to be sparser in many minority neighborhoods in a reflection of American demographics.Players in rural areas also complained about the lack of Pokémon spawns, PokéStops, and gyms in their area.Pokémon Go was criticized for game accessibility issues by players with physical disabilities.The AbleGamers Foundation COO, Steve Spohn, said that when Pokémon Go was compared to other mobile games, it ""excludes disabled players to a significant degree"".\n\nPolice departments in various countries issued warnings, some tongue-in-cheek, regarding inattentive driving, trespassing, and being targeted by criminals due to being unaware of one\'s surroundings.In the state of New York, sex offenders are banned from playing the app while on parole.Bosnian players were warned to stay out of minefields left over from the 1990s Bosnian War.In Russia, a 21-year-old video blogger, Ruslan Sokolovsky, was arrested in September 2016 for two months after playing Pokémon Go at the Church of All Saints in Yekaterinburg, and eventually received a suspended sentence for three and a half years in prison for charges of blasphemy.\n\nPeople have suffered various injuries from accidents related to the game.In Japan, the first accident occurred within hours of the game\'s release.The first death in Japan attributed to Pokémon Go occurred in late August 2016.A distracted driver playing the game killed one woman and seriously injured another.The 39-year-old farmer did not notice the women crossing a street and struck them with his truck.The woman died of a broken neck.Japan\'s National Police Agency said it was the 79th Pokémon Go-related accident in the country.On August 11, 2016, a young girl in Cambodia was reportedly killed after being hit by a car while trying to capture a Pokémon on a road.The case was the first death related to Pokémon Go among Southeast Asian countries.In January 2017, Chinese-American civilian Jiansheng Chen was shot dead while playing Pokémon Go.\n\nAl-Azhar University in Cairo described the game as ""harmful mania.""A Cossack leader declared that it ""smacks of Satanism"", Kuwait banned the game from government sites, Indonesian officials deemed it a national security threat, and in Israel the IDF banned the game from Army bases out of security considerations.In Saudi Arabia, the General Secretariat of the Council of Senior Scholars declared, in light of a 2001 fatwa banning the Pokémon card game as a form of gambling, that the electronic app required a new ruling.This was also followed by both Indian and Malaysian Islamic leaders telling Indian and Malaysian Muslims to avoid the game.\n\nDuring Thailand\'s 2016 constitutional referendum polling, Pokémon Go players were told to refrain from entering polling stations.Thus the Thai National Broadcasting and Communications Commission intends to ask Niantic to remove Pokémon characters and PokéStops from locations such as government facilities, historic and religious sites, private property as well as dangerous spots such as narrow footpaths and rivers.Cambodia has banned the game in a former genocide site after Pokémon players showed up at the site.Vietnam has banned players from entering the government and defense offices.The Vietnamese Ministry of Information and Communications is also considering the game\'s negative impact to Vietnamese society, where many people left home at night, crossed the road or drove on the street with their eyes kept focused on phones, which brought the need to ban the game in the country.Following the move by other Southeast Asian neighbors, the Philippines also banned the game in all administration offices.According to a survey by Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF), around 4% of employers in Malaysia fired their staff for playing the game during working hours.\n\nRussia also voiced their concerns over the application, with Nikolay Nikiforov, the country\'s Minister of Communications and Mass Media, suspecting foreign intelligence agencies using the application to collect information, while some fundamentalist religious groups in the region claim it to be demonic.The Supreme Council of Virtual Space in Iran officially banned the game in August 2016 over security concerns.The same month, The Pentagon facility in U.S. restricted the use of the game on their property, citing security risks by collecting secret information.In the United Kingdom, 290 police incidents were reported to have occurred in July 2016 in the country due to the game.In September 2016, Niantic stopped supporting the CyanogenMod mobile operating system.This prevented users playing on CyanogenMod from playing the game from that point forward.\n\nIn India, the Gujarat High Court issued a notice to Niantic, the developer of the popular AR-based game, on the grounds of ""posing danger to public safety"".The notice was issued on a PIL (Public Interest Litigation) seeking a ban on the location-based AR reality game in India.In addition, a second PIL was filed against the developers of Pokémon Go for hurting religious sentiments by showing images of eggs in places of worship of different religious groups.But the Indian Government refused to ban the game.\n\nPokémon Gos targeted local advertising has been described by Shoshana Zuboff in The Age of Surveillance Capitalism as an experiment that initiated from Google to move targeted advertising from the digital domain (cost per click) into the physical domain (cost per visit) by the use of sponsored locations.""In the end we recognize that the probe was designed to explore the next frontier: the means of behavioral modification.The game about the game is, in fact, an experimental facsimile of surveillance capitalism\'s design for our future.""\n\nMultiple unofficial, third-party apps were created to correspond with Pokémon Go.Notable apps include ""Poké Radar"" and ""Helper for Pokémon Go"", where players can crowdsource much of the Pokémon that can be found in the game at a particular time.At its peak of popularity, ""Poké Radar"" hit #2 on the Apple App Store, behind Pokémon Go itself.\n\nAnother app, GoChat, which allows players to leave messages for other players at specific locations, accrued more than 1 million downloads in five days and reached the top 10 in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.However, the app\'s developer Jonathan Zarra chose to leave the app unmonetized and had financial trouble keeping the app\'s servers online until bringing on angel investor and board member Michael Robertson.After acquiring significant funding, the app reached over 2 million active users.According to RiskIQ, at least 215 fake versions of the game were available by July 17, 2016.Several of these fake apps contained malicious programming and viruses.\n\nLaunched on July 22, 2016, ""Pokévision"" enabled players to find exactly where Pokémon spawned and how much time was left until they despawned; the site used data hacked directly from the game.In the five days following the website\'s launch, 27 million unique visitors used the site.On July 31, multiple search apps and sites, including Pokévision, were disabled as they violated Niantic\'s terms of service.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Niantic responded by implementing changes and new features in the game which allowed players to easily play remotely.However, starting on August 1, 2021, Niantic began rolling back these changes as part of their Exploration Bonus Updates.Players in New Zealand and the United States were the first to receive the post-pandemic changes, and gradually, they were rolled out to the rest of the world ""in accordance with recommendations from global health organizations.""In fear of violations in health and personal safety regulations, as well as negatively impacting players with disabilities, the company has since received heavy criticism from the player base (including top players Brandon Tan and Nick Oyzon) due to their reverting safety measures implemented during the pandemic, in which gym and Pokéstop interaction distances were increased from 40 to 80 metres.Despite increasing rates of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in various U.S. states (resulting in overflowing hospitals), Niantic are firm on not keeping the pandemic bonuses.Players began boycotting Pokémon Go since in first week of August 2021.\n\nOn Twitter, the #HearUsNiantic started trending worldwide as fans and players voiced their censure towards Niantic\'s decision to remove the pandemic bonuses.A letter was sent to Niantic, which responded to the community by stating that the pandemic changes will not stay.As Niantic are an AR company, part of their business strategy is to sell user data by players after completing AR Mapping tasks where they can log their surroundings at marked PokéStops in their in-game maps.The reduced distance means an increased potential for Niantic to generate more revenue.Another reason for their changes is for Niantic to preserve their image of being an AR tech giant; on their blog post they stated that it is their ""mission"" to ""encourage outdoor exploration"" and ""to connect [people] to real places in the real world, and to visit places that are worth exploring.""Players have also speculated that Niantic is rolling back the pandemic bonuses to send players closer to sponsored businesses such as McDonald\'s (marked by a PokéStop or gym), from which Niantic has made a lot of money.\n\nList of

60,"{'Wiki_Title': 'Pokémon Go', 'Wiki_All_Text': 'Pokémon Go (stylized as Pokémon GO) is a 2016 augmented reality (AR) mobile game, part of the Pokémon franchise, developed and published by Niantic in collaboration with Nintendo and The Pokémon Company for iOS and Android devices.It uses mobile devices with GPS to locate, capture, train, and battle virtual Pokémon, which appear as if they are in the player\'s real-world location.The game is free-to-play; it uses a freemium business model combined with local advertising and supports in-app purchases for additional in-game items.The game launched with around 150 species of Pokémon, which had increased to around 700 by 2021.\n\nPokémon Go was released to mixed reviews; critics praised the concept but criticized technical problems.It was one of the most used and profitable mobile apps in 2016, having been downloaded more than 500 million times worldwide by the end of the year.It is credited with popularizing location-based and AR technology, promoting physical activity, and helping local businesses grow due to escalated foot traffic.However, it attracted controversy for contributing to accidents and creating public nuisances.Various governments expressed concerns about security, and some countries regulate its use.The game had over monthly active users by May 2018, over a billion global downloads by early 2019, and grossed more than in revenue by 2020.\n\nAfter establishing a game account, players create and customize their own avatars.Once created, an avatar is displayed on a map based on the player\'s geographical location.Features on the map include \'PokéStops\' and \'Pokémon Gyms\'.These PokéStops can be equipped with items called \'Lure Modules\', which attract additional wild, and occasionally rare, Pokémon.Gyms serve as battle locations for team-based king of the hill matches.PokéStops and Gyms are typically located at places of interest.These locations were initially re-purposed portals from Ingress, Niantic\'s previous augmented reality (AR) game.This has led to PokéStops and Pokémon Gyms being placed at dangerous or inconvenient locations, such as a now-deleted Gym at the Korean Demilitarized Zone and Bagram Airforce Base, which was abandoned by U.S. forces in July 2021.Since 2019, these locations also include submissions from Go players which are largely reviewed by other players.\n\nAs players move within their real world surroundings, their avatars move within the game\'s map.Different Pokémon species reside in different areas of the world; for example, Water-type Pokémon are generally found near water.When a player encounters a Pokémon, it may be viewed either in AR mode or with a live rendered, generic background.AR mode uses the camera and gyroscope on the player\'s mobile device to display an image of a Pokémon as though it were in the real world.Players can take screenshots of the Pokémon they encounter either with or without the AR mode activated.\n\nAlthough the game is free to play, it supports in-app purchases, where players can purchase additional Poké Balls and other in-game items.These items include Incense, which attracts Pokémon to the player as they move for sixty minutes, Lure Modules, which players use at PokéStops to attract Pokémon to their current location near the PokeStop, and Lucky Eggs, which double experience points gained for a thirty-minute period from use.All Pokémon are displayed with a Combat Power, which is a rough measure of how powerful that Pokémon is in battle.Generally, as players level up, they catch Pokémon with higher CP and Pokémon are somewhat harder to catch.The player can check how strong their Pokémon are by the ""Appraisal"" system.\n\nPlayers can customize their avatar\'s appearance with clothing options that differ in availability according to season, player level, and game sponsors.Clothing includes: hats, accessories, tops, bottoms, socks, footwear and bags.Most clothing aligns with either the look of a specific Pokémon, a specific team and/or Pokémon region.Many pieces of clothing are free, but pieces can also be purchased using coins, earned during select events, awarded as the player levels up, or received as a prize for special research completion.\n\nAnother way for a player to customize their avatar is with a pose.Poses, like clothing, are free, purchased, or awarded.Certain poses are event based and can only be earned during the event they are attached to.Once the event is over, there is no guarantee that the pose will be available in-game again.\n\nIn April 2024, Pokémon GO was updated to allow greater customization of player avatars.Customization now includes a limited number of different hair styles, the ability to adjust the weight of the avatar, and expanded options for skin color.This update was met with mass backlash from the playerbase, as the new avatars were perceived to be of inferior graphical quality in comparison to the outgoing models, and because the updated models interfered with some pre-update cosmetic items, of which many had been purchased by players.\n\nUnlike most other installments in the Pokémon series, players in Pokémon Go do not battle wild Pokémon to catch them.During an encounter with a wild Pokémon, a player may throw a Poké Ball at it by flicking it from the bottom of the screen up toward the Pokémon.If the Pokémon is caught, it will come under the ownership of the player.Factors in the success rate of catching a Pokémon include the Pokémon\'s catch rate, the timing, the type of Poké Ball used, etc.After catching a wild Pokémon, the player is awarded two types of in-game currencies: Candies and Stardust.The Candies awarded by a successful catch depend on what evolutionary chain a Pokémon belongs to.A player can use Stardust and Candies to raise a Pokémon\'s level and hence ""Combat Power"" (CP).However, only Candies are needed to evolve a Pokémon, except for certain Pokémon that might need special items.Each Pokémon evolution tree has its own type of Candy, which can only be used to evolve or level up.The maximum level a player can achieve was originally level 40, but expanded to 50 as of November 30, 2020.The player can also transfer the Pokémon back to the Pokémon Professor Willow to earn more Candies and create room for more Pokémon.Shiny Pokémon are available through multiple ways, mostly by chance.One popular goal of the game is to complete the entries in the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon logbook, by catching and evolving them to collect every one in it.\n\nIn September 2016, Niantic introduced a ""Buddy Pokémon"" feature, which allows players to pick a Pokémon to appear alongside them on the profile screen, and receive in-game rewards and bonuses based on the chosen Pokémon.The feature was released later that month.Certain Pokémon have different distances that they need to be walked in order to receive candy.The more the player walks in real time, the more candy they can earn.During the same update, Niantic made it impossible for players with rooted or jailbroken devices to log into the game in an effort to reduce and prevent cheating.\n\nOn January 20, 2018, Pokémon Go held the first Community Day, a monthly event that increases the appearance rate of a specific Pokémon and offer an exclusive move to the final evolution of the featured Pokémon only if caught or evolved during the event window.Players also have a higher chance to catch the Shiny variant of the featured Pokémon.The first Community Day featured Pikachu, with the exclusive move Surf to Raichu.\n\nThe game is regularly updated with new Pokémon, and as of March 25, 2022, there are just over 730 Pokémon in the game (not including regional varieties) out of a total 1008.\n\nRegional Pokémon are often released together, such as Hoenn region Pokémon released in December 2017, Alolan variants in May 2018, Sinnoh region Pokémon(along with the Sinnoh Stone item used to evolve them) released in October 2018, Unova region Pokémon (and the Unova Stone) in September 2019, Kalos region Pokémon in December 2020, and again more Alola region Pokémon in March 2022.\n\nMythical and legendary Pokémon are often released individually (or in pairs/trios) in special events or quests.The first Legendary Pokémon released was Groudon, in December 2017.The Mythical Pokémon Meltan and its evolved form, Melmetal are so far the only Pokémon to have made their debut on Pokémon Go.Their release coincided with the release of Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee!on the Nintendo Switch, Pokémon Go introduced the new Mythical Pokémon Meltan originally as a teaser, later to be available to capture only in Pokémon Go via a ""Mystery Box"" item that could be obtained through transferring Pokémon from Pokémon Go to either Nintendo Switch Pokémon games, or by completing new Research Tasks.\n\nIn August 2020, Mega Evolution came to Pokémon Go with four Pokémon able to Mega Evolve into five forms.\n\nPlayers earn experience points for various in-game activities.Players rise in level as they earn experience points (XP), with various features being progressively unlocked.Most-notably, at level five, the player can battle at a Pokémon Gym and join one of three color-coded teams (red for Team Valor, blue for Team Mystic, or yellow for Team Instinct), which act as factions battling for control of Gyms within the Pokémon Go world.\n\nIn June 2017, Niantic announced that the game mechanics of Gyms would be revamped for a more teamwork-oriented experience; Gyms were disabled on June 19, 2017, with the new Gyms being released with the next app update a few days later.As of the update, Gyms included a spinnable component to receive in-game items such as Potions and Poké Balls.Additionally, Gyms are capped at containing six Pokémon, each of which must be unique in that Gym.Coins are now earned based on the amount of time the defending Pokémon has been in a Gym, as opposed to a one-per-day gym defender bonus of 10 coins per current defending Pokémon.Legendary, Mythical and Buddy Pokémon cannot be placed in Gyms.\n\nIn July 2017, Raid Battles were introduced.Raid Battles consist of a group of players gathering to confront an over-leveled Pokémon located in a Gym.If the Pokémon is defeated, the players gain the chance to catch a regular version of it.Raid difficulties range from 1 to 5, with 1 being of the lowest difficulty, and 5 being the most difficult to defeat.Level 5 raids are exclusive to Legendary Pokémon.The first of these, Articuno and Lugia, were released on July 22, 2017, after the Go Fest, with Moltres and Zapdos following.From September to November, the 3 Legendary Beasts: Entei, Raikou and Suicune, were released shortly after, rotating regions every month.Following their departure, the Legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh appeared in Raid Battles from November 27, 2017, to December 12, 2017.In August 2020, level 3 Mega raids arrived with the introduction of Mega Evolution.At the same time, Level 2 and 4 raids were combined into Level 1 and 3 raids.\n\nIn May 2022, Raid Battle were updated to include the addition of Mega Legendary Pokémon, which were turned to 6 stars, the highest currently in the game.The only Pokémon included in these Raids were Mega Latios and Mega Latias.\n\nIn October 2022, a new form of raid battle called ""Elite Raids"" were introduced.Elite Raids differ to normal raids in a number of ways, most notably that they can only be battled in person, take 24 hours to start, and are extremely difficult, often requiring a large number of players to defeat the Pokémon.\n\nIn May 2023, another new form of raid battles were introduced called ""Shadow Raids"".Shadow Raids may only be battled in person and award the chance to catch a Shadow Pokémon upon defeat.During the battle, the Pokémon may become ""enraged"", increasing both attack and defence, but can be returned to normal using a ""Purified Gem"".\n\nIn December 2018, Niantic added player vs player Trainer Battles.In January 2020, Niantic rolled out an online battle format Go Battle League which allows players to fight other players worldwide.Unlike the Trainer Battles format introduced in 2018, Go Battle League does not require physical proximity, scanning QR code on each other\'s phone, knowing each other\'s friend code, or any other real-world interactions between players.Instead, participating players are automatically paired by the game server via some variant of the Elo rating system.\n\nIn July 2019, Pokémon Go introduced Team GO Rocket battles.Team GO Rocket NPCs could be battled at PokéStops indicated with it twitching and being a dark color or in Team GO Rocket Balloons which follow the player on the map.After victory, the player has the opportunity to capture a ""Shadow Pokémon"" which are relatively low-leveled, angry-looking Pokémon.Shadow Pokémon have a higher attack stat but a lower defense stat than a normal Pokémon.After capture, the player can choose to purify the Shadow Pokémon.Purified Pokémon are higher-leveled than their Shadow counterparts, can learn an exclusive move when purified, and need fewer candies to evolve.\n\nThe concept for the game was conceived in 2014 by Satoru Iwata of Nintendo and Tsunekazu Ishihara of The Pokémon Company as an April Fools\' Day collaboration with Google, called the Google Maps: Pokémon Challenge.Ishihara was a fan of developer Niantic\'s previous transreality game, Ingress, and saw the game\'s concept as a perfect match for the Pokémon series.Niantic, a subsidiary of Google, used the crowdsourced data from Ingress to populate the locations for PokéStops and gyms within Pokémon Go, data from Google Maps to spawn specific Pokémon on certain terrain, and map display from OpenStreetMap since December 2017.The game\'s application logic uses the open source Kubernetes system - and due to the game\'s sheer scale of users, a number of bugs with the Kubernetes system was discovered and later fixed.Niantic was spun off from Google as an independent company in 2015 following the company reorganization into Alphabet Inc.\n\nIn 2015, Ishihara dedicated his speech at the game\'s announcement on September 10 to Iwata, who had died two months earlier.Tatsuo Nomura, who joined Niantic in 2015 after he developed the Google Maps Pokémon Challenge, acted as Director and Product Manager for the game.The game\'s soundtrack was written by longtime Pokémon series composer, Junichi Masuda, who also assisted with some of the game\'s design.Among the game\'s graphic designers was Dennis Hwang, who previously created the logo of Gmail while working for Google.\n\nOn March 4, 2016, Niantic announced a Japan-exclusive beta test would begin later that month, allowing players to assist in refining the game before its full release.The beta test was later expanded to other countries.On April 7, it was announced that the beta would expand to Australia and New Zealand.Then, on May 16, the signups for the field test were opened to the United States.The test came to an end on June 30.\n\nAt the Comic-Con 2016, John Hanke, founder of Niantic, revealed the appearances of the three team leaders: Candela (Team Valor), Blanche (Team Mystic), and Spark (Team Instinct).Hanke conveyed that approximately 10% of the ideas for the game were implemented.Future updates, including the addition of trading, more Pokémon, implementation of Pokémon Centers at PokéStops, a patch for the ""three step glitch"", and easier training, were also confirmed.He also stated that Niantic would be continuing support for the game for ""years to come"".In an interview with TechCrunch in September 2016, Hanke hinted that player vs. player Pokémon battles would be released in a future update.In December 2016, coffeehouse chain Starbucks and telecommunications company Sprint collaborated with Nintendo to add PokéStops and gyms at certain locations of theirs throughout the United States.That same month, a companion app for Apple Watch devices was released, which allows users to receive notifications about nearby Pokémon, but does not allow for them to be caught.In January 2017, an additional 5,000 more Starbucks locations became available as gyms.In February 2017, an update was released which introduced over 100 species based in the Johto region from the second generation of the core Pokémon series, which were added alongside the original 151.The update also included the addition of new berries, new Pokémon encounter mechanics, and an expanded selection of avatar clothing options.Some of the Pokémon introduced in Ruby and Sapphire were added in late 2017, starting with a Halloween event in October and 50 more in December.A weather system was added alongside the latter, allowing real-world weather to affect gameplay.In November 2018, a game developed by Game Freak and heavily inspired by Pokémon Go, Pokémon: Let\'s Go, Pikachu!and Let\'s Go, Eevee! was released on the Nintendo Switch.This game will feature Pokémon Go style catching with Joy-Con and there has integration between the two games.In addition, new Pokémon Meltan was revealed in September, becoming the first new Pokémon to be released through Pokémon Go.On October 10, 2018, The Pokémon Company and Niantic announced plans to introduce Pokémon from Diamond and Pearl into Pokémon Go.On October 12, Niantic teased one of the Generation IV Pokémon that would be coming to Pokémon Go.On October 25, a feature known as Adventure Sync was announced, which will record the player\'s walking data in the background.On October 26, Niantic announced research tasks for Bug type Pokémon that will give players a chance to catch Shedinja throughout November.\n\nAccording to John Hanke in a January 2019 interview with Business Insider, 2018 saw Go become the game initially envisioned by Niantic.\n\nIn 2020, Niantic made major changes to gameplay mechanisms to account for the COVID-19 pandemic which saw many players unable to leave their homes to play.These development shift saw changes like the addition of indoor step tracking to count toward in-game distance challenges, long distance PVP battles, increased ""incense"" effectiveness, increased spawn points, and a doubled player radius.\n\nThe Pokémon Go Plus is a Bluetooth Low Energy wearable device, developed by Nintendo\'s Platform Technology Development division, that allows players to perform certain actions in the game without looking at their smart device.When a player is near a Pokémon or PokéStop, the Plus vibrates.The player can then press the button to capture the Pokémon or receive items from the PokéStop; the player cannot check what they have received until the next time they sign into the app onto their mobile device.The design consists of a Poké Ball and the shape of the Google Maps pin.The decision to create the device rather than create a smartwatch app was to increase uptake among players for whom a smartwatch is prohibitively expensive.It was released in the United Kingdom and North America on September 16, 2016.\n\nThe game\'s official launch began on July 6, 2016, with releases in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.Due to server strain from high demand upon release, Niantic CEO John Hanke stated that the release in other regions was to be ""paused until Niantic was comfortable"" fixing the issues.European releases started on July 13, and the game became available to most of the continent over the following ten days.The Japanese launch was initially reported to be on July 20; however, the game was delayed after a sponsorship deal with fast food chain McDonald\'s was leaked, instead releasing two days later.Although the game was proposed to be released in France on July 15, it was postponed until July 24 out of respect and due to safety concerns following a terrorist attack in Nice on July 14.Following the shut down of third-party apps and websites in late-July 2016—significantly reducing server strain—Niantic was able to continue pushing release worldwide.Central and South America and most of Southeast Asia subsequently saw releases in early August.Indonesia was the first Asian country to have the game playable, despite the game not being officially released in that region until August 6.\n\nIn South Korea, the game was not officially released as major restrictions on the use of online mapping data exist.However, due to a glitch, a small area around Sokcho in the northeastern part of the country was considered a part of Niantic\'s North Korea mapping region, making the game fully playable in that area.Numerous people took advantage of the gap to play the game.Bus tickets from the capital city of Seoul sold out and people living within Sokcho shared information on free Wi-Fi areas to tourists.Players also discovered a gym in Panmunjom, along the Korean Demilitarized Zone; however, Niantic later removed it from the game.Following the release of Pokémon Go in Japan, parts of Busan also became playable as parts of the city are considered part of Japan\'s mapping area due to the proximity of Tsushima Island.The game officially released in the country in January 2017.\n\nIn mainland China, Google services are banned by the Great Firewall, whereas the GPS function in the game is blocked by Niantic.Players of Pokémon Go in China have to download the game with App Store IDs from other regions and use VPN to access Google services in order to load the game, and some even use a GPS spoofing app to bypass the GPS blocking.Some players also downloaded a clone app called City Spirit Go, which was released shortly after Pokémon Go beta test in Japan.As of 2020, the official game is still unplayable in most parts of China with GPS modules being blocked in-game.\n\nDuring its launch in Southeast Asia in August 2016, the game officially excluded Myanmar, but users in Thailand discovered that the game was fully playable in border cities near the nation.The game was released in the Balkans, Macau, and Central Asia in September 2016, and was also released throughout Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia by the end of the year.\n\nOn September 11, 2018, the game appeared in Russia\'s App Store and Google Play Store over two years after the first launch.However, Niantic did not officially announce the release.\n\nIn May 2019, the game was released on the Samsung Galaxy Store.\n\nInvestors were buoyed by the response to the initial release of Pokémon Go on July 7, with Nintendo\'s share price rising by an initial 10% and by July 14 shares rose to as high as 50%.Despite Nintendo only owning a 32% stake in The Pokémon Company and an undisclosed stake in Niantic, Nintendo\'s market value increased by US$9 billion within five days of release of Pokémon Go.The trend continued for more than a week after the game\'s release and by July 19, the stock value of Nintendo more than doubled as compared to pre-release.Turnover sales reached a record-breaking ¥703.6 billion (US$6.6 billion); and trading of the stock accounted for a quarter of all trades on the Tokyo Stock Exchange\'s main board.The Financial Times believed that investors were speculating not on Pokémon Go as such, but on future Nintendo app releases being as successful as the company moves more into the mobile app market—an area they were historically reluctant to enter in the belief it would cannibalise its portable console and video game sales.Nintendo plans to release four more smartphone app games by March 2017, and investors remarked that Pokémon Go showed Nintendo still has some of the ""most valuable character intellectual property in the world"" with franchises such as Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid.\n\nBy July 22, Nintendo gained ¥1.8 trillion ($17.6 billion) in market capitalization since the game\'s launch.However, following clarification from Nintendo that the company did not produce Pokémon Go nor had tangible financial gains from it, its stock fell by 18%—equating to a ¥708 billion ($6.7 billion) loss in market value—on July 25.This was the largest single-day decline for Nintendo since 1990 and the maximum one-day exchange of finances allowed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.The company has an approximate 13% ""effective economic stake"" in the game, according to Macquarie Securities.\n\nThe surge in stocks extended beyond Nintendo, with Tomy, TV Tokyo, and the Bank of Kyoto, among other companies, all seeing significant gains.Similarly, Zagg, which owns a company that manufactures battery cases, saw a 25% rise in its stock in relation to Pokémon Go.\n\nAt launch, the game suffered from frequent server outages due to extreme usage.The global server usage expectation for the game was surpassed within 15 minutes of the game\'s release in Australia and New Zealand, and peaked at 50 times expected traffic, or 10 times the expected worst-case scenario.Frequent crashes and authentication errors plagued the game\'s release and persisted for several days.For the first two days after launch, players were unable to access the game through their Pokémon Trainer Club accounts; only Gmail-based accounts were able to gain access to the game.Servers again suffered frequent outages in Australia on July 11; players blamed people in the United Kingdom for bypassing local servers and using Australian ones to play the game before its official release.On July 16, a few hours after the release in many European countries, the game\'s servers temporarily went down.The outage was claimed by a hacking group called ""PoodleCorp"", who said they used a DDoS attack to take them down, although the problem was fixed later that day.The next day, the servers went down again as the game was launched in Canada.John Hanke issued an apology for the server issues at San Diego Comic Con 2016, stating ""we weren\'t provisioned for what happened"".\n\nSome early iOS installs of Pokémon Go required users to provide the app with full access to their Google accounts, thereby allowing the app to ""access players\' Gmail-based email, Google Drive-based files, photos and videos stored in Google Photos, and any other content within their Google accounts"".The Pokémon Company and Niantic responded to the concerns, recognizing that the iOS app, at the time, ""... erroneously requests full access permission for the user\'s Google account ...""However, Adam Reeve—the person who initially made claims of the security issues in a Tumblr post—later backtracked on his claim and was not ""100 percent sure"" it was valid.Dan Guido, CEO of the security company Trail of Bits, analyzed the app\'s programming and discovered that although the game did request full account access, this did not enable third-party usage as initially conveyed.Guido found that this did enable Niantic to access people\'s email addresses and phone numbers unintentionally.A subsequent iOS app update reduced the scope of access.Niantic also issued a statement assuring users that no information was collected nor was any information beyond what was necessary to use the app accessed.\n\nAlongside server issues, Pokémon Go suffered from several glitches.One of the more prominent bugs appeared in mid-July 2016 and rendered the game\'s tracking feature useless.Normally, this feature shows between zero and three footprints to inform the player of how close they are to a nearby Pokémon; however, it universally became ""stuck"" at three steps, earning it the name ""three-step-glitch"".Niantic removed the footstep feature altogether on July 30, sparking criticism from players.By August 1, players reported a new glitch that swaps their captured Pokémon with another creature at random.Another bug, confirmed by Niantic in August, inadvertently made capturing Pokémon more difficult.Some legendary Pokémon, which are rare and powerful versions of the creatures, were also obtained by players in a glitch, though they were later removed from the accounts of the trainers to keep the game fair.\n\nPokémon Go released to ""mixed or average"" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.Upon release, critics called the experience enjoyable, but noted the game\'s technical issues.\n\nCritics praised various aspects of Pokémon Go.Oscar Dayus (Pocket Gamer) said that the game was an immensely enjoyable experience and continued with how ""the very personal nature of catching Pokémon in your own neighborhood made me smile more than any game has for years"".Jeremy Parish (US Gamer) compared the game and its social aspects to a massively multiplayer online game.Reviewers also praised the game enabling the promotion of physical exercise.Terri Schwartz (IGN) said it was ""secretly the best exercise app out there"" and that it changed her daily walking routine.Patrick Allen (Lifehacker) wrote an article with tips about how to work out using Pokémon Go.Julia Belluz (Vox) said it could be the ""greatest unintentional health fad ever"" and wrote that one of the results of the game that the developers may not have realized was that ""it seems to be getting people moving"".Users took an extra 194 steps per day once they started using the app, which approximated to 26% more than usual.IGN named it the 100th best video game of all time in 2018.\n\nPhilip Kollar and Allegra Frank (Polygon) both agreed that Pokémon Go was ""an exciting social experience"", but were not sure how long the game and its popularity would last, stating it could either last for coming years or ""end up as a brush fire craze that the whole gaming world is talking about for a few weeks and then is forgotten"".\n\nOther critics expressed more negative opinions of the game, with many citing frequent crashes and other technical issues, along with shallow gameplay.Kallie Plagge (IGN) said that although the game lacked in polish and depth, the overall experience made up for it.Matt Peckham (Time) criticized the game for its frequent crashes.Mike Cosimano (Destructoid) also took issue with the game, saying the original idea showed promise, but was improperly executed.Kat Brewster (The Guardian) wrote that although she thought Pokémon Go was not a good game, it was ""a great experience"".The server problems also received negative press.Miguel Concepcion (GameSpot) said that although he enjoyed the game\'s strong social appeal and visual design, the game\'s ""initial iteration is a buggy mess on all levels"", with one of the reasons being the constant server problems.Another glitch that appeared a few days after launch was the ""three-step glitch"", which made it impossible to ""hunt down a specific Pokémon"".Patricia Hernandez (Kotaku) said, ""the three step glitch adds to what has been a terrible launch for Pokémon Go"".Critics also emphasized on the large gap between the rural and urban players.Rural players seem to be at a major disadvantage when playing the game, while city players have access to more PokéStops and Gyms.\n\nPokémon Go rapidly rose the American iOS App Store\'s ""Top Grossing"" and ""Free"" charts.The game has become the fastest game to top the App Store and Google Play, beating Clash Royale, and it became the most downloaded app on the App Store of any app in their first week.Within two days of release, it was installed on more than 5% of Android devices in the United States, according to SimilarWeb, According to Sensor Tower, the game was downloaded more than 10 million times within a week of release, becoming the fastest such app to do so, and reached 15 million

20 million.By July 15, approximately 1.3 million people were playing the game in the Netherlands, despite the app not being officially released in the country at the time.On the day of release in Japan, more than 10 million people downloaded the game, including 1.3 million in the first three hours.By July 31, the game exceeded 100 million downloads worldwide, according to App Annie and Sensor Tower.On August 8, Pokémon Go reached the milestone of over 100 million downloads on Google Play alone after barely 33 days on the market.\n\nThrough in-game purchases, the game generated more than by the end of July 2016, with App Annie reporting that Pokémon Go had generated around in revenue every day that month.The same month, Sensor Tower reported that the game had passed more than in worldwide revenue, beating every existing record set by Clash of Clans and Candy Crush by a wide margin.On August 12, 2016, the Financial Times reported that Pokémon Go reached in revenue after five weeks counting only the U.S., British, and German markets.The average daily usage of the app on Android devices in July 2016 exceeded that of Snapchat, Tinder, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.Due by the game\'s massive popularity, several app developers became focused on developing similar AR apps using available software development kits (SDK).By September 2, 2016, Pokémon Go had generated more than $440 million in worldwide revenue, according to Sensor Tower.By September 30, it had received downloads and grossed in 80 days, according to market research firm Newzoo.Pokémon Go reached the milestone of $600 million in revenue after only 90 days on the market, becoming the fastest mobile game ever to do so.\n\nBesides in-game purchases, partnerships with retail chains like Starbucks, McDonald\'s, Sprint, pay Niantic Labs for ""Foot Traffic"" on-demand of the retail shops.\n\nThe game was awarded five Guinness World Records in August 2016: most revenue grossed by a mobile game in its first month (); most downloaded mobile game in its first month (130 million downloads); most international charts topped simultaneously for a mobile game in its first month (top game in 70 different countries); most international charts topped simultaneously for a mobile game in its first month (top grossing in 55 countries simultaneously); and fastest time to gross $100 million by a

Go was awarded the App Store\'s breakout hit of 2016.Pokémon Go was reported to be the most searched game on Google in 2016.\n\nUsage of the game in the United States peaked on July 15, and by mid-September, had lost 79% of its players there.Forbes said ""the vaguely curious stopped playing and the more committed players ran up against a fairly unsatisfying endgame"".In October 2016, Niantic released a Halloween-themed event, which saw a surge in revenue up to 133% as reported by Sensor Tower, placing the game back to top of the charts of highest grossing apps.It was reported that the game earned approximately $23.3 million between October 25 and 29, up from approximately $10 million between October 18 and 22.According to App Annie, Pokémon Go grossed an estimated in 2016.\n\nIn February 2017, Pokémon Go was awarded being the best app at the Crunchies award event.By February 2017, the game has been downloaded more than times worldwide, with a reported in revenue made, becoming the fastest mobile game ever to do so.By June 2017, the game was downloaded more than 750 million times, with an estimated revenue of according to Apptopia.According to mobile app research firm Apptopia, approximately 60 million users were still playing the game a year after launch.In May 2018, The Pokémon Company announced that the game reached over 800million downloads worldwide.Forbes estimated that the game may have come close to 900million downloads by September 2018.The top five countries where it has received the most downloads are the United States (21%), Brazil (9.3%), India (8.6%), Mexico (5.5%), and Indonesia (5%).As of February 2019, the game has been downloaded by over 1billion people worldwide.\n\nA report from SuperData Research ranked Pokémon Go as the 9th highest grossing mobile game of 2017, with an annual revenue of .Bloomberg estimated that Pokémon Go generated up to in total revenue by late 2017.Two years from its initial launch, analyst firm Sensor Tower estimated the game had grossed over from in-app purchases, reporting that players around the world continue to spend each day.SuperData Research reported that, in May 2018, Pokémon Go grossed in monthly revenue and had monthly active players, its highest since Summer 2016.In July 2018, Pokémon Go was the top-grossing mobile app of the month.Since the introduction of trading and friends features, Sensor Tower has reported that players spend an average of per day.Apptopia reported that, by September 2018, the game had grossed over from in-app purchases; the top five countries where it has received the most revenue are Japan (), the United States (), Germany (), the United Kingdom (), and Australia ().It was the fourth highest-grossing game of 2018, with , and in 2019 alone Pokémon Go earned , according to Superdata Research, a division of Nielsen Media Research.Pokémon Go live events earned in tourism revenue during 2019.According to Sensor Tower in November 2020, Pokémon Go had accumulated nearly unique installs and generated almost in revenue from in-game purchases via the iOS App Store and Google Play.Its largest market in terms of both installs and revenue is the United States, followed by Japan and Germany in revenue and by Brazil and Mexico in installs.\n\nDuring 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic causing restrictions on the ability of players to play Go outside their homes, Niantic implemented new features which allowed players to play the game from inside their homes, and this was credited with increasing its playerbase throughout the year despite the restrictions.Despite a brief drop early in the pandemic, the number of monthly active users of the game rose by 45 percent between January and August 2020, and the game\'s revenue in 2020 was the highest in its history, exceeding even its 2016 revenue.The game generated more than of revenue in the first 10 months of 2020 according to Sensor Tower, and it was the top-grossing mobile game of December 2020.Pokémon Go was one of the top five highest-grossing games of 2020 with an annual revenue of according to SuperData Research, bringing the game\'s cumulative revenue to by 2020.The game generated a further in the first half of 2021.\n\nThe game was referred to as a ""social media phenomenon"" which has brought people together from all walks of life.231 million people engaged in 1.1 billion interactions that mentioned Pokémon Go on Facebook and Instagram in the month of July.Numerous media outlets referred to the surge in popularity as ""Pokémon Go Mania"", or simply ""Pokémania"".The massive popularity of the game resulted in several unusual positive effects.For example, the game placed players where they can help catch criminals and report crimes in progress, although it has also placed some in harm\'s way, and has even aided law enforcement\'s community relations, albeit with caveats.Businesses also benefited from the nearby presence of PokéStops (or them being PokéStops themselves) with the concomitant influx of people, and the intense exploration of communities has brought local history to the forefront.The game was also seen bringing its players to places of worship, as many Pokégyms are located there.Despite some criticism by religious leaders, this was received positively by religious groups, who saw it as reminding adherents to come and pray.Some establishments considered purchasing lures in the game to attract additional players to PokéStops on their property.Within a week of its release, a secondary market emerged for the game, both for the resell of high-level accounts on Craigslist and PlayerUp, and for the sale of expert advice on Thumbtack.Wireless provider T-Mobile US started an offer for free data for a year for Pokémon Go sessions, and Yelp added a filter that only shows businesses which have a PokéStop nearby.National parks across the United States saw an influx of visitors due to the game, with ""hundreds or thousands"" of people visiting the National Mall and Memorial Parks in Washington, D.C. on the weekend following Pokémon Go release in the country.Small museums with PokéStops placed at exhibits also reported increased attendance, such as the McNay Art Museum in San Antonio, Texas, and the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens in Boca Raton, Florida.Charity organizations also sought engagement from players, with animal shelters offering dog walks to people who want to hatch eggs.\n\nEduardo Paes, then-mayor of Rio de Janeiro, stated that he hoped the app would be released in Brazil before the start of the 2016 Summer Olympics in the city (and it was, on August 3), and United States presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton mentioned the app during their 2016 election campaigns.In late July 2016, during a public address, the President of Italy, Sergio Mattarella, compared a political issue about the date of an incoming referendum as preposterous as the hunt for the Pokémon.Shortly after the game\'s release, Bellator mixed martial artist Michael Page celebrated a knockout of his match opponent, Evangelista Santos by putting on a red Ash Ketchum-like hat and rolling a prop Poké Ball in Santos\'s direction.On July 25, Dwayne Johnson released a promo video featuring MatPat and Ali-A with himself as a tough, rare Pokémon.\n\nThe game was credited for popularizing AR, and was praised by genderfluid groups for letting the players choose a ""style"" instead of ""gender"".The game also had a positive impact among individuals with autism.The ""Pokémon Theme"" from the animated series saw a 630% increase in listeners on music streaming platform Spotify during the month of the game\'s release.Meanwhile, streaming services such as

including ticket prices and attractions, was released by Niantic ahead of the ticket sale, over 20,000 tickets sold out within a half hour.During the event itself, attendees suffered connectivity issues and crashes, due to the heavy amount of localized cellular activity.Afterwards, Niantic announced that they would refund everybody who bought a ticket, as well as give them $100 of in-game

Akil.Akil places Pokémon characters in destroyed Syrian streets as a reminder for a world lost behind the screen.While Pokémon Go was trending worldwide, Akil couldn\'t help but notice how the media forgot about the war in Syria, and visualised his idea in the form of digital collages.Khaled\'s Pokémon series quickly went viral across the globe after he posted it online.This photography series was exhibited in various locations including the American University Museum.\n\nThe app was criticized for using locations such as cemeteries and memorials as sites to catch Pokémon, including the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, Arlington National Cemetery, the ANZAC War Memorial, and Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.Niantic later removed content from sensitive areas such as the Hiroshima Memorial and Holocaust Museum.The game sparked complaints from Dutch company ProRail, who said that players entered their railway tracks, and fire stations told players to not impede their staff by congregating outside.\n\nThe game\'s distribution of PokéStops and gyms (derived from the portals in Ingress, Niantic\'s science fiction-themed AR game) was noted to be sparser in many minority neighborhoods in a reflection of American demographics.Players in rural areas also complained about the lack of Pokémon spawns, PokéStops, and gyms in their area.Pokémon Go was criticized for game accessibility issues by players with physical disabilities.The AbleGamers Foundation COO, Steve Spohn, said that

the game from government sites, Indonesian officials deemed it a national security threat, and in Israel the IDF banned the game from Army bases out of security considerations.In Saudi Arabia, the General Secretariat of the Council of Senior Scholars declared, in light of a 2001 fatwa banning the Pokémon card game as a form of gambling, that the electronic app required a new ruling.This was also followed by both Indian and Malaysian Islamic leaders telling Indian and Malaysian Muslims to avoid the game.\n\nDuring Thailand\'s 2016 constitutional referendum polling, Pokémon Go players were told to refrain from entering polling stations.Thus the Thai National Broadcasting and Communications Commission intends to ask Niantic to remove Pokémon characters and PokéStops from locations such as government facilities, historic and religious sites, private property as well as dangerous spots such as narrow footpaths and rivers.Cambodia has banned the game in a former genocide site after Pokémon players showed up at the site.Vietnam has banned players from entering the government and defense offices.The Vietnamese Ministry of Information and Communications is also considering the game\'s negative impact to Vietnamese society, where many people left home at night, crossed the road or drove on the street with their eyes kept focused on phones, which brought the need to ban the game in the country.Following the move by other Southeast Asian neighbors, the Philippines also banned the game in all administration offices.According to a survey by Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF), around 4% of employers in Malaysia fired their staff for playing the game during working hours.\n\nRussia also voiced their concerns over the application, with Nikolay Nikiforov, the country\'s

places of worship of different religious groups.But the Indian Government refused to ban the game.\n\nPokémon Gos targeted local advertising has been described by Shoshana Zuboff in The Age of Surveillance Capitalism as an experiment that initiated from Google to move targeted advertising from the digital domain (cost per click) into the physical domain (cost per visit) by the use of sponsored locations.""In the end we recognize that the probe was designed to explore the next frontier: the means of behavioral modification.The game about the game is, in fact, an experimental facsimile of surveillance capitalism\'s design for our future.""\n\nMultiple unofficial, third-party apps were created to correspond with Pokémon Go.Notable apps include ""Poké Radar"" and ""Helper for Pokémon Go"", where players can crowdsource much of the Pokémon that can be found in the game at a particular time.At its peak of popularity, ""Poké Radar"" hit #2 on the Apple App Store, behind Pokémon Go itself.\n\nAnother app, GoChat, which allows players to leave messages for other players at specific locations, accrued more than 1 million downloads in five days and reached the top 10 in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.However, the app\'s developer Jonathan Zarra chose to leave the app unmonetized and had financial trouble keeping the app\'s servers online until bringing on angel investor and board member Michael Robertson.After acquiring significant funding, the app reached over 2 million active users.According to RiskIQ, at least 215 fake versions of the game were available by July 17, 2016.Several of these fake apps contained malicious programming and viruses.\n\nLaunched on July 22, 2016, ""Pokévision"" enabled players to find exactly where Pokémon spawned and how much time was left until they despawned; the site used data hacked directly from the game.In the five days following the website\'s launch, 27 million unique visitors used the site.On July 31, multiple search apps and sites, including Pokévision, were disabled as they violated Niantic\'s terms of service.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Niantic responded by implementing changes and new features in the game which allowed players to easily play remotely.However, starting on August 1, 2021, Niantic began rolling back these changes as part of their Exploration Bonus Updates.Players in New Zealand and the United States were the first to receive the post-pandemic changes, and gradually, they were rolled out to the rest of the world ""in accordance with recommendations from global health organizations.""In fear of violations in health and personal safety regulations, as well as negatively impacting players with disabilities, the company has since received heavy criticism from the player base (including top players Brandon Tan and Nick Oyzon) due to their reverting safety measures implemented during the pandemic, in which gym and Pokéstop interaction distances were increased from 40 to 80 metres.Despite increasing rates of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in various U.S. states (resulting in overflowing hospitals), Niantic are firm on not keeping the pandemic bonuses.Players began boycotting Pokémon Go since in first week of August 2021.\n\nOn Twitter, the #HearUsNiantic started trending worldwide as fans and players voiced their censure towards Niantic\'s decision to remove the pandemic bonuses.A letter was sent to Niantic, which responded to the community by stating that the pandemic changes will not stay.As Niantic are an AR company, part of their business strategy is to sell user data by players after completing AR Mapping tasks where they can log their surroundings at marked PokéStops in their in-game maps.The reduced distance means an increased potential for Niantic to generate more revenue.Another reason for their changes is for Niantic to preserve their image of being an AR tech giant; on their blog post they stated that it is their ""mission"" to ""encourage outdoor exploration"" and ""to connect [people] to real places in the real world, and to visit places that are worth exploring.""Players have also speculated that Niantic is rolling back the pandemic bonuses to send players closer to sponsored businesses such as McDonald\'s (marked by a PokéStop or gym), from which Niantic has made a lot of money.\n\nList of
